    "IMPORTANT Note for Michael\n",
    "\n",
    "Why we chose to enrich the model with the intermediary fields “student_goal” and “pragmatic_need”:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Capture the core idea: Cooperative answers rely on Theory of Mind (ToM) elements—understanding the user’s goals, intent, and needs. These fields allow the model to explicitly represent and reason about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Cost efficiency: If we instead generated “cooperative” questions and re-queried the context, the number of LLM calls and input tokens would increase significantly, raising costs. By focusing directly on the core idea, we can anticipate such questions more efficiently."

(at the time of physical death) Relationships unknown Occupation Groundskeeper (when he was alive) Child Molester (when he was alive) Serial Killer (confirmed after death, not stated either way when he was alive) Appearances 2010 reboot Portrayal Jackie Earle Haley This version of Freddy Krueger is the main antagonist of the A Nightmare on Elm Street Reboot . In this film, Freddy appeared once again as a Dream Demon and a serial killer after his death. In life, he was a child molester. It isn\\'t stated in the film whether or not he\\'d killed anybody when he was alive. After death, he killed the majority of the teenage children who he blames for his death in their nightmares, but Nancy Holbrook and Quentin Smith survived. Unlike the original Freddy Krueger , who, over the course of the series, developed a cheeky and dark humored personality and always cracked puns and jokes when he killed his victims, the reboot version of Freddy seemed to be more in line with how Wes Craven had originally envisioned the character; a much more serious killer.

Freddy initially appeared to have been wrongly accused and seemingly looked like a friendly gardener around the children. The parents, after they heard about the abuse from their children and observed slashes on their skin and clothes that were consistent with his trademark glove , chased Freddy down to a building, in which Freddy locked himself in. One of the parents threw in a container of gasoline with a burning rag. It is implied that he did this to force him to come out, not to intentionally burn him to death. However, he did end up burning him to death. The parents did that to spare their children the trauma of having to testify against him in open court. Having been burned to death, Freddy somehow returned as a vengeful Dream Demon who killed off the teenage children in their dreams one by one as payback against the parents for killing him and/or as payback against them for reporting his actions to their parents. During the climax, Nancy pulled Freddy into the physical world and apparently killed him by severing his gloved-hand and slashed his throat with a broken paper cutter blade. However, Freddy was shown to still be alive and he killed Nancy\\'s mother, Gwen Holbrook, from the mirror reflection. (ENTP) Characterization Powers and abilities Weaknesses Appearance The reboot Freddy\\'s clothing looked almost identical to that of both the Freddy Krueger of the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series and the Freddy Krueger of Freddy\\'s Nightmares; he wore the same red and green sweater and hat as well as sported the iconic glove that he used to kill his victims. The biggest difference were his burns, while the previous Freddy Kruegers did indeed look burnt the remake\\'s Freddy\\'s burns looked much more realistic and made Freddy realistically look like a person who had been horribly burnt. This Freddy also had a noticeable hole in his left cheek as well as one milky cloudy eye and one red blood shot eye. Along with those, this version of Freddy Krueger looked more gaunt and thinner than the previous Freddy Kruegers.

Jackie Earle Haley , who played Freddy, originally auditioned for the role of Glen Lantz in the original Elm Street , but lost to his friend, Johnny Depp . Haley went on and portrayed Freddy in the remake 26 years later. The remake Freddy being a child molester was something that Wes Craven had wanted the original Freddy to be in the first Nightmare film, but it being straight out stated was dropped in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time. However, it is strongly implied at times in the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series. It is, however, straight out stated in Freddy\\'s Nightmares: A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Series , which is a different story than any of the movies, in the episode \" It\\'s My Party and You\\'ll Die If I Want You To \". This version of Freddy makes an appearance as a DLC Character for the reboot and ninth entry of the fighting game series, Mortal Kombat . Despite his resemblance to the 2010 remake\\'s version of Freddy though, he is voiced by Patrick Seitz imitating Robert Englund\\'s voice as the character. This version of Freddy was added as DLC killer for the online survival horror game Dead By Daylight in 2017, along with Quentin Smith as a playable survivor. He is the third killer from a licensed property to be featured in the game, as fellow slasher villains Michael Myers of the Halloween film series and Leatherface of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre film series were added to the game prior to his inclusion. This was the only Freddy Krueger portrayal to have his scars and burned appearance to be completely CGI rather than practical makeup affects.', \"Mr. Underwood General information Age ?

His equivalent in the comic Freddy Krueger's A Nightmare on Elm Street is Walter Fingle . Biography A severe alcoholic, Mr. Underwood abused Freddy both verbally and physically. His preferred method of beating Freddy was apparently whipping with a belt. Once he became a teenager, Freddy, fed up with his foster father's abuse, murdered Mr. Underwood when he came home drunk one day, and laughed off his blows before he stabbed him in the eye with a straight razor as revenge, a memory which Freddy's daughter, Maggie Burroughs , later witnessed after she entered Freddy's mind years later in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare .\", \"Little Girl General information Age 12 (at the time of her death) Relationships unknown Occupation One of Freddy Krueger's pre-death victims Appearances Freddy vs. Jason Portrayal Joelle Antonissen This article is about a character credited simply as Little Girl in the closing credits of Freddy vs. Jason .

She is also one of the 20 Child Victims of the Springwood Slasher. This unidentified young girl was a resident of the town of Springwood , Ohio. In the 1960s, she became a target of a child murderer named Freddy Krueger. Freddy abducted the little girl and brought her back to the Boiler Room of the Power Plant where he worked. He took the doll the girl was cluching and threw it into a burner. He then sharpened the knives he was going to use in front of her and then stood up straight and approached her as she backed against a wall. Soon after, her life ended. It is possible that this little girl might be one of the ghosts always seen playing jump-rope or hopscotch in the vicinity of the Elm Street House . Lori Campbell had a nightmare in a police station wherein she saw this little girl with no eyes and verticle slashes across her eye sockets. The girl told her that Freddy was coming back.

However, whenever he is pulled into the real world, he becomes mortal again. He was created by Wes Craven, and has been consistently portrayed by Robert Englund since his first appearance.

Trivia If not counting the DC characters, Freddy is the second guest character to appear in the Mortal Kombat series, the first being Kratos . However, he is the first DLC character originated from movies. Unlike Kratos, Freddy is available for both consoles. However, also unlike Kratos, he does not have his own arena. In the movies, Freddy only had claws on his right hand. In this game, however, he has claws on both hands for gameplay mechanics. This marks the first time Freddy is seen using two claws on his hands instead of just one. His first Fatality is based on the way he killed Glen Lantz in the original Nightmare on Elm Street , while his second Fatality is based on the way he killed Kristen Parker in the 4th Nightmare on Elm Street. His X-Ray Move is based on the way he killed Taryn White in the 3rd Nightmare on Elm Street . The names of his first fatality and his X-Ray are lines spoken to two of his victims before he killed them, the first to Ronald Kincaid in response to his comment \"I\\'ll see you in hell\", the second to Taryn White, a former junkie. Much like Shang Tsung , Freddy Krueger feeds off the souls of his victims. Much like Kabal , Freddy\\'s disfigured appearance is the result of being burned alive. Much like how Smoke can dash forward and backwards while turned into a cloud of smoke, Freddy can also move away and forward in a unique way, with his Dream Shift special move. Krueger and Scorpion were both aged 32 before they died and became immortals. They also share a similar power of hellfire. Ed Boon has stated there\\'s a future possibility of more DLC, but it\\'s uncertain at this time. Amongst with Reptile , Kano , Baraka , the bosses and the rest of the DLC characters, Krueger has no battle cry. Freddy Krueger, along with Kintaro , Kratos, Reptile, Shang Tsung, Shao Kahn , Skarlet , and Johnny Cage are the only characters in MK 2011 who do not cry during their Babalities . He is the only character in MK 2011 to have a Fatality that involves the victim only losing one arm. Also, his Tell\\'em Freddy Sent Ya fatality is the only Fatality that can be performed anywhere in the stage. The woman Freddy kills in at the end of his ladder ending bears an extremely strong resemblance to Nancy Thompson on the original poster advertising the first A Nightmare on Elm Street . Nancy Thompson being the woman who originally defeats Freddy at the end of the first film, but is killed in the 3rd film. Like Kratos, Freddy performs a sweep with his clawed gloves instead of his leg. The game uses the body model of JEH\\'s Freddy. However Robert Englund reprises the role once again, making this version of Freddy the only one to be a hybrid of two different versions of Krueger. This also makes Robert Englund the only Freddy actor to have portrayed two different versions of Freddy Krueger, as well as the first time he has voiced Freddy in a video game. For many years since the Freddy DLC was released many Mortal Kombat and Nightmare fans assumed that Patrick Seitz, the voice actor of Scorpion, had lent his talents to voicing the Dream Demon and imitated the vocal style of Robert Englund to sound as close to Freddy as possible. However Ed Boon, one of the creators of the Mortal Kombat series revealed in 2017 that they had in fact gotten to work with Robert Englund for the Freddy DLC, meaning it had been Englund who had voiced Freddy in the fighting game the whole time. Even Patrick Seitz confirmed Ed Boon\\'s statement, as he had many times in the past told fans who asked him that he hadn\\'t voiced Freddy, and didn\\'t even know where the assumption of him doing the voice had come from. Freddy is the first guest character from a film franchise to appear in the Mortal Kombat series. Freddy\\'s appearance as a playable guest character would mark the beginning of several guest characters from horror films making playable appearances in the Mortal Kombat series. Mortal Kombat X features Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th , and Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . He is also the only film guest fighter to have his original actor reprise his voice. Aside from a \"Shhh.\" while performing his throw and a \"No!\" after being thrown in front of a car during The Streetstage fatality, Freddy does not speak during the game. He is only heard laughing in his intro and some of his fatalities, and he also grunts or yells in pain when attacked. All of these effects are voiced by Robert Englund, which was not confirmed until 2017 by Ed Boon on Twitter. Freddy only had claws on his right hand in every appearance of the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. In Mortal Kombat however, he has claws on both hands for gameplay mechanics. Additionally, his bio has stated that he needs two claws in order to defeat Shao Kahn. The majority of the moves in Freddy\\'s move list are named after lines he has said, and a handful are inspired by methods he used to kill his victims in the A Nightmare on Elm Street films. Tell \\'Em Freddy Sent Ya , his first Fatality, is based on the way he killed Glen Lantz in the original Nightmare on Elm Street . The move\\'s name is actually Freddy\\'s response to another victim, Roland Kincaid: the teenager told Freddy, \"I\\'ll see you in hell\", before he was killed. The blood that spews out of the ground is likely a reference to Glenn\\'s death in the same film, as the same thing happened when he was absorbed into his bed. What a Rush , his X-Ray Move, is named after a line he said to Taryn White before he killed her in the 3rd Nightmare on Elm Street . The move itself is based on how he killed her. Krueger\\'s Freddy Fingers , Hell Spike and Glove Toss moves are the same techniques used to kill Terry Fenstein, John Doe and Rick Johnson respectively in the A Nightmare on Elm Street films. Welcome to My Nightmare , his second Fatality, is based on the way he killed Kristen Parker in the 4th Nightmare on Elm Street . The move\\'s name comes from a line he said to Jason Voorhees, in the film Freddy vs. Jason . Power Glove Toss , the enhanced version of Glove Toss , is likely a reference in name to the Nintendo Power Glove, a gaming peripheral that Freddy used during the killing of Spencer Lewis. His Tell \\'Em Freddy Sent Ya Fatality is the only Fatality that can be performed anywhere in the stage. The woman Freddy kills in the end of his ladder ending bears a strong resemblance to Nancy Thompson from the first A Nightmare on Elm Street. This scene itself is a reference to the main promotional artwork of the film, which features Nancy in bed, awake with terror in her eyes while a transparent Freddy and his clawed glove can be seen above her . Freddy is the only character who can actually dodge Shao Kahn\\'s Hammer Throw move without teleporting or simply jumping, with the help of the Nightmare Stance . In a technical sense, he is the only reoccurring guest character in the Mortal Kombat games, appearing in Mortal Kombat (2011) and the mobile version of Mortal Kombat X . Freddy\\'s appearance in the mobile game is very different than his in-game appearance, appearing more like he did in the movies including only one razor glove. He is one of two characters in the mobile version of Mortal Kombat X with a revamped X-Ray attack as compared to their previous appearances. The second being Shao Kahn. In the game, Freddy will slash his opponent into the air and stabbing them in the chest with his glove, but will punch the opponent in the face, breaking their jaw before slashing them in the face shattering their entire skull. In Mortal Kombat Mobile, \"Nightmare\" Freddy Krueger can be upgraded from a Gold Card to a Diamond Card. He is the first mobile-exclusive character in Mortal Kombat X Mobile. In his original challenge, the player would receive a Cyber Armor after beating Hard Mode instead of Freddy\\'s Glove. This was changed in Update 1.11.1.', \"This is about the Freddy Krueger's Glove of A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010 film). If you are looking for one or more other versions of Freddy Krueger's Glove, please check the Freddy Krueger's Glove Disambiguation . Freddy Krueger's Glove is the main weapon of Freddy Krueger .

Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek.\" The family moved frequently during Depp\\'s childhood, and he and his siblings lived in more than 20 different locations, settling in Miramar , Florida, in 1970. In 1978, Depp\\'s parents divorced. He engaged in self-harm as a child, due to the stress of dealing with family problems. He has seven or eight self-inflicted scars. In a 1993 interview, he explained his self-injury by saying, \"My body is a journal in a way. It\\'s like what sailors used to do, where every tattoo meant something, a specific time in your life when you make a mark on yourself, whether you do it yourself with a knife or with a professional tattoo artist\". 1980s With the gift of a guitar from his mother when he was 12, Depp began playing in various garage bands . His first band was in honor of his girlfriend, Meredith. A year after his parents\\' divorce, Depp dropped out of high school to become a rock musician. As he said on Inside the Actors Studio , he attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician. He played with The Kids, a band that enjoyed modest local success. The Kids set out together for Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method, but the group split up before signing a record deal. Depp subsequently collaborated with the band Rock City Angels and co-wrote their song \"Mary\", which appeared on Rock City Angels\\' debut for Geffen Records titled Young Man\\'s Blues . On December 24, 1983, Depp married Lori Anne Allison, a makeup artist and sister of his band\\'s bass player and singer. During Depp\\'s marriage, his wife worked as a makeup artist while he worked a variety of odd jobs, including a telemarketer for pens. His wife introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage , who advised Depp to pursue an acting career. They divorced in 1985. Depp later dated and was engaged to Sherilyn Fenn (whom he met on the set of the 1985 short film Dummies ). Both Sherilyn Fenn and Depp auditioned for the 1986 film Thrashin\\' and they were both cast, with Depp being chosen by the film\\'s director to star as the lead, which would have been Depp\\'s first major role. Depp was later turned down by the film\\'s producer who rejected the directors decision. Career Johnny Depp at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival ===Television=== Depp starred in a lead role on the Fox TV television series, 21 Jump Street , which premiered in 1987. Depp accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest , who inspired him. Depp\\'s long time friend Sal Jenco joined the cast as a semi-co-star as the janitor named Blowfish. The series\\' success turned Depp into a popular teen idol during the late 1980s. He felt \"forced into the role of product.\" Depp decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him. Film roles Depp\\'s first major role was in the 1984 classic horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street , playing the boyfriend of the heroine, Nancy Thompson , (played by Heather Langenkamp ) and one of \\'s victims. He originally went with his friend Jackie Earle Haley as company while he auditioned for a part in the film, however, Depp was given a role instead as Glen Lantz while 26 years later Haley would get the part of Freddy Krueger in the remake. Depp was the first choice and was cast to star in the now classic, 1986 American skater drama film Thrashin\\' , chosen and cast by the director but ultimately rejected by the film\\'s producer. In 1986, he appeared in a secondary role as a Vietnamese -speaking private in Oliver Stone \\'s Platoon . In 1990 he undertook the quirky title role of the Tim Burton film, Edward Scissorhands . The film\\'s success began his long association with Burton. Depp, a fan and long-time friend of writer Hunter S. Thompson , played a version of Thompson (named Raoul Duke ) in 1998\\'s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , based on the writer\\'s pseudobiographical novel of the same name. Depp accompanied Thompson as his road manager on one of the author\\'s last book tours. In 2006, Depp contributed a foreword to Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson , a posthumous biography published by ammobooks.com. Depp paid for most of Thompson\\'s memorial event, complete with fireworks and the shooting of Thompson\\'s ashes by a cannon, in Aspen , Colorado, where Thompson lived. Critics have described Depp\\'s roles as characters who are \"iconic loners.\" Depp has noted this period of his career was full of \"studio defined failures\" and films that were \"box office poison,\" but he thought the studios never understood the films and did not do a good job of marketing. Depp has chosen roles which he found interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office. Depp wearing a mustache and goatee similar to the style used in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl The 2003 Walt Disney Pictures film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a major success, in which Depp\\'s performance as the suave pirate Captain Jack Sparrow was highly praised. Studio bosses were more ambivalent at first, but the character became popular with the movie-going public. According to a survey taken by Fandango , Depp was a major draw for audiences. The film\\'s director, Gore Verbinski , has said that Depp\\'s character closely resembles the actor\\'s personality, but Depp said he modeled the character after Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards . Depp was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for the role. In 2004, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor , for playing Scottish author J. M. Barrie in the film Finding Neverland . Depp next starred as Willy Wonka in the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , a major success at the box office and earning him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy . Depp returned to the role of Jack Sparrow for the sequel Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\\'s Chest , which opened on July 7, 2006 and grossed $135.5 million in the first three days of its U.S. release, breaking a box office record of the highest weekend tally. The next sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean , At World\\'s End , was released May 24, 2007. Depp has said that Sparrow is \"definitely a big part of me\", and he wants to play the role in further sequels. Depp voiced Sparrow in the video game, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow . Johnny Depp\\'s swashbuckling sword talents as developed for the character of Jack Sparrow , were highlighted in the documentary film Reclaiming the Blade . Within the film, Swordmaster Bob Anderson shared his experiences working with Depp on the choreography for The Curse of the Black Pearl . Anderson, who also trained Errol Flynn , another famous Hollywood pirate, described in the film Depp\\'s ability as an actor to pick up the sword to be \"about as good as you can get.\" Depp and Gore Verbinski were executive producers of the album Rogues Gallery, Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs and Chanteys. Depp played the title role of Sweeney Todd in Tim Burton\\'s film adaptation of the musical , for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy . Depp thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and praised Tim Burton for his \"unwavering trust and support.\" Depp played the former Heath Ledger character in the 2009 film, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus along with Jude Law and Colin Farrell . All three actors gave their salaries from the film to Ledger\\'s daughter, Matilda. He portrayed the Mad Hatter in Burton\\'s Alice in Wonderland , and the titular character in Rango . Future roles Depp will appear in a film version of writer Hunter S. Thompson \\'s book, The Rum Diary , portraying the main character, Paul Kemp. In 2007, Depp accepted Warner Bros. \\' proposal to make a film of the gothic soap opera Dark Shadows , a series that aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971. He had been a fan as a child. Depp and Graham King will produce the movie with David Kennedy, who ran Dan Curtis Productions inc. until Curtis died in 2006. He will play Tonto in a future Lone Ranger film. Depp will also produce Hugo Cabret , based on the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret , film a documentary about Keith Richards , and have a cameo appearance in Jack & Jill . Depp will make a cameo appearance in a film adaptation of 21 Jump Street , the show he starred in during the late 1980s. Depp will star in and produce an adaptation of the comic book Rex Mundi . Depp will collaborate with Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides director Rob Marshall again to create a remake of The Thin Man . Depp also showed interest in starring in the next Sin City films, with Robert Rodriguez wanting him to star as Wallace . Collaboration with Tim Burton Depp has collaborated with director and close friend Tim Burton in seven films, beginning with Edward Scissorhands (1990), opposite Winona Ryder and Vincent Price . His next role with Burton was in the 1994 film, Ed Wood . Depp later said that \"within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed.\" At the time, the actor was depressed about films and filmmaking. This part gave him a \"chance to stretch out and have some fun\"; he said working with Landau \"rejuvenated my love for acting\". Producer Scott Rudin once said, \"Basically Johnny Depp is playing Tim Burton in all his movies,\" although Burton personally disapproved of the comment. Depp, however agrees with Rudin\\'s statement. According to Depp, Edward Scissorhands represented Burton\\'s inability to communicate as a teenager. Ed Wood reflected Burton\\'s relationship with Vincent Price (very similar with Edward D. Wood, Jr. and Béla Lugosi ). Depp\\'s Hollywood Walk of Fame star received on November 19, 1999Depp\\'s next venture with Burton was the role of Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow (1999), opposite Christina Ricci . Sleepy Hollow reflected Burton\\'s battle with the Hollywood studio system. For his performance, Depp took inspiration from Angela Lansbury , Roddy McDowall and Basil Rathbone . Depp stated, \"I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl.\" Depp did not work with Burton again until 2005 in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , in which he played Willy Wonka . Depp modeled the character\\'s hair on Anna Wintour . The film was a box office success and received positive critical reception. Gene Wilder , who played Willy Wonka in the 1971 film , initially criticized this version. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released in July, followed by Corpse Bride , for which Depp voiced the character Victor Van Dort, in September. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) followed, bringing Depp his second major award win, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy as well as his third nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor . Burton first gave him an original cast recording of the 1979 stage musical in 2000. Although not a fan of the musical genre, Depp grew to like the tale\\'s treatment. He cited Peter Lorre in Mad Love (1935) as his main influence for the role, and practiced the songs his character would perform while filming Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\\'s End . Although he had performed in musical groups, Depp was initially unsure that he would be able to sustain Stephen Sondheim \\'s lyrics. Depp recorded demos and worked with Bruce Witkin to shape his vocals without a qualified voice coach. In the DVD Reviews section, Entertainment Weekly \\' s Chris Nashawaty gave the film an A minus, stating, \"Depp\\'s soaring voice makes you wonder what other tricks he\\'s been hiding... Watching Depp\\'s barber wield his razors... it\\'s hard not to be reminded of Edward Scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago... and all of the twisted beauty we would\\'ve missed out on had [Burton and Depp] never met.\" In his introduction to Burton on Burton , a book of interviews with the director, Depp called Burton \"...a brother, a friend,...and [a] brave soul\". The next Depp-Burton collaboration was Alice in Wonderland (2010). Depp played the Mad Hatter alongside Helena Bonham Carter , Anne Hathaway and Alan Rickman . Other interests Depp in April 2011===Music=== As a guitar player, Depp has played slide guitar on the Oasis song \"Fade In-Out\" (from Be Here Now , 1997), as well as on \"Fade Away (Warchild Version)\" (b-side of the \" Don\\'t Go Away \" single). He also played acoustic guitar in the movie Chocolat and on the soundtrack to Once Upon a Time in Mexico . He is a friend of The Pogues \\' Shane MacGowan , and performed on MacGowan\\'s first solo album. He was also a member of P , a group featuring Butthole Surfers singer Gibby Haynes , Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones . He has appeared in Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers \\' music video \" Into the Great Wide Open \". Winemaker and restaurateur Depp and Paradis grow grapes and have wine making facilities in their vineyard in Plan-de-la-Tour north of Saint-Tropez . He is known for a fondness of French wines : among Depp\\'s favorites are the Bordeaux wines Château Calon-Ségur , Château Cheval Blanc and Château Pétrus , and the Burgundy wine Domaine de la Romanée-Conti . Interviewed in Madame Figaro , he stated, \"With those wines, you reach nirvana \". Along with Sean Penn , John Malkovich and Mick Hucknall , Depp co-owned the Parisian restaurant-bar Man Ray , located near the Champs-Élysées . Personal life Family and relationships Depp backstage at the Ahmanson Theatre on December 31, 2006Depp was engaged to actress Winona Ryder for three years beginning in July 1990. They met at the Great Balls of Fire! premiere in June 1989; two months later they began dating. The relationship was highly publicized and received much scrutiny by the media and tabloid press. Since 1998, following a four year relationship with British supermodel Kate Moss , Depp has had a relationship with Vanessa Paradis , a French actress and singer whom he met while filming The Ninth Gate . The couple have two children. Daughter Lily-Rose Melody Depp was born May 27, 1999, and son John \"Jack\" Christopher Depp III was born April 9, 2002. In 2007, his daughter recovered from a serious illness, an E. coli infection that began to cause her kidneys to shut down and resulted in an extended hospital stay. To thank Great Ormond Street Hospital , Depp visited the hospital in November 2007 dressed in his Captain Jack Sparrow outfit and spent 4 hours reading stories to the children. In 2008 he donated £1 million (about $2 million) to the hospital. Although Depp has not remarried, he has stated that having children has given him \"real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life, in work, in everything.\" \"You can\\'t plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful ride I was on. It was destiny ; kismet. All the math finally worked.\" The family divides its time between their home in Meudon , located in the suburbs of Paris, Los Angeles, an island he bought in The Bahamas , and their villa in Le Plan-de-la-Tour , a small town 20 km from Saint-Tropez , in the south of France. Depp also acquired a vineyard estate in the Plan-de-la-Tour area in 2007. Legal issues In 1994, Depp was arrested and questioned by police for allegedly causing serious damage to a New York City hotel suite. He was arrested again in 1999 for brawling with paparazzi outside a restaurant while dining in London with Paradis. Tattoos Depp has around 13 tattoos , many of them signifying important persons or events in his life. They include a Native American in profile and a ribbon reading \"Wino Forever\" (originally \"Winona Forever\", altered after his breakup with Winona Ryder) on his right biceps , \"Lily-Rose\" (his daughter\\'s name) over his heart, \"Betty Sue\" (his mother\\'s name) on his left biceps, and a sparrow flying over water with the word \"Jack\" (his son\\'s name; the sparrow is flying towards him rather than away from him as it is in Pirates of the Caribbean ) on his right forearm . Unannounced appearance on set On October 8, 2010, Depp made an unannounced appearance at a London Primary School near where he was filming scenes for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides . He turned up dressed as his character Jack Sparrow after receiving a letter from a pupil asking for his help with a class mutiny. Controversy Comments on U.S. In 2003, Depp\\'s comments about the United States appeared in Germany\\'s Stern magazine : \"America is dumb, is something like a dumb puppy that has big teeth — that can bite and hurt you, aggressive.\" Although he later asserted that the magazine misquoted him and the quotation was taken out of context, Stern stood by its story, as did CNN .com in its coverage of the interview. CNN added his remark that he would like his children \"to see America as a toy, a broken toy. Investigate it a little, check it out, get this feeling and then get out.\" The July 17, 2006 edition of Newsweek reprinted the \"dumb puppy\" quotation, verbatim, in the context of a Letter to the Magazine. Depp has also disagreed with subsequent media reports that he says paint him as a \"European wannabe\", saying that he likes the anonymity of living in France and his simpler life there.

He has one brother, Daniel, who is a novelist, and two sisters, Christie (now his personal manager) and Debbie. His parents divorced when he was a teenager and his mother married, as her second husband, Robert Palmer (died 2000), whom Depp called \"an inspiration to me\". The Depp family in the United States began with a French Huguenot immigrant, Pierre Deppe or Dieppe, who settled in Virginia around 1700, part of a refugee colony situated above the falls on the James River. The actor has also surmised that he is part Native American , saying in 2011, \"I guess I have some Native American [in me] somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American, she grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek.\" The family moved frequently during Depp\\'s childhood, and he and his siblings lived in more than 20 different locations, settling in Miramar , Florida, in 1970. In 1978, Depp\\'s parents divorced. He engaged in self-harm as a child, due to the stress of dealing with family problems. He has seven or eight self-inflicted scars. In a 1993 interview, he explained his self-injury by saying, \"My body is a journal in a way. It\\'s like what sailors used to do, where every tattoo meant something, a specific time in your life when you make a mark on yourself, whether you do it yourself with a knife or with a professional tattoo artist\". 1980s With the gift of a guitar from his mother when he was 12, Depp began playing in various garage bands . His first band was in honor of his girlfriend, Meredith. A year after his parents\\' divorce, Depp dropped out of high school to become a rock musician. As he said on Inside the Actors Studio , he attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician. He played with The Kids, a band that enjoyed modest local success. The Kids set out together for Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method, but the group split up before signing a record deal. Depp subsequently collaborated with the band Rock City Angels and co-wrote their song \"Mary\", which appeared on Rock City Angels\\' debut for Geffen Records titled Young Man\\'s Blues . On December 24, 1983, Depp married Lori Anne Allison, a makeup artist and sister of his band\\'s bass player and singer. During Depp\\'s marriage, his wife worked as a makeup artist while he worked a variety of odd jobs, including a telemarketer for pens. His wife introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage , who advised Depp to pursue an acting career. They divorced in 1985. Depp later dated and was engaged to Sherilyn Fenn (whom he met on the set of the 1985 short film Dummies ). Both Sherilyn Fenn and Depp auditioned for the 1986 film Thrashin\\' and they were both cast, with Depp being chosen by the film\\'s director to star as the lead, which would have been Depp\\'s first major role. Depp was later turned down by the film\\'s producer who rejected the directors decision. Career Johnny Depp at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival ===Television=== Depp starred in a lead role on the Fox TV television series, 21 Jump Street , which premiered in 1987. Depp accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest , who inspired him. Depp\\'s long time friend Sal Jenco joined the cast as a semi-co-star as the janitor named Blowfish. The series\\' success turned Depp into a popular teen idol during the late 1980s. He felt \"forced into the role of product.\" Depp decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him. Film roles Depp\\'s first major role was in the 1984 classic horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street , playing the boyfriend of the heroine, Nancy Thompson , (played by Heather Langenkamp ) and one of \\'s victims. He originally went with his friend Jackie Earle Haley as company while he auditioned for a part in the film, however, Depp was given a role instead as Glen Lantz while 26 years later Haley would get the part of Freddy Krueger in the remake. Depp was the first choice and was cast to star in the now classic, 1986 American skater drama film Thrashin\\' , chosen and cast by the director but ultimately rejected by the film\\'s producer. In 1986, he appeared in a secondary role as a Vietnamese -speaking private in Oliver Stone \\'s Platoon . In 1990 he undertook the quirky title role of the Tim Burton film, Edward Scissorhands . The film\\'s success began his long association with Burton. Depp, a fan and long-time friend of writer Hunter S. Thompson , played a version of Thompson (named Raoul Duke ) in 1998\\'s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , based on the writer\\'s pseudobiographical novel of the same name. Depp accompanied Thompson as his road manager on one of the author\\'s last book tours. In 2006, Depp contributed a foreword to Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson , a posthumous biography published by ammobooks.com. Depp paid for most of Thompson\\'s memorial event, complete with fireworks and the shooting of Thompson\\'s ashes by a cannon, in Aspen , Colorado, where Thompson lived. Critics have described Depp\\'s roles as characters who are \"iconic loners.\" Depp has noted this period of his career was full of \"studio defined failures\" and films that were \"box office poison,\" but he thought the studios never understood the films and did not do a good job of marketing. Depp has chosen roles which he found interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office. Depp wearing a mustache and goatee similar to the style used in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl The 2003 Walt Disney Pictures film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a major success, in which Depp\\'s performance as the suave pirate Captain Jack Sparrow was highly praised. Studio bosses were more ambivalent at first, but the character became popular with the movie-going public. According to a survey taken by Fandango , Depp was a major draw for audiences. The film\\'s director, Gore Verbinski , has said that Depp\\'s character closely resembles the actor\\'s personality, but Depp said he modeled the character after Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards . Depp was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for the role. In 2004, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor , for playing Scottish author J. M. Barrie in the film Finding Neverland . Depp next starred as Willy Wonka in the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , a major success at the box office and earning him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy . Depp returned to the role of Jack Sparrow for the sequel Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\\'s Chest , which opened on July 7, 2006 and grossed $135.5 million in the first three days of its U.S. release, breaking a box office record of the highest weekend tally. The next sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean , At World\\'s End , was released May 24, 2007. Depp has said that Sparrow is \"definitely a big part of me\", and he wants to play the role in further sequels. Depp voiced Sparrow in the video game, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow . Johnny Depp\\'s swashbuckling sword talents as developed for the character of Jack Sparrow , were highlighted in the documentary film Reclaiming the Blade . Within the film, Swordmaster Bob Anderson shared his experiences working with Depp on the choreography for The Curse of the Black Pearl . Anderson, who also trained Errol Flynn , another famous Hollywood pirate, described in the film Depp\\'s ability as an actor to pick up the sword to be \"about as good as you can get.\" Depp and Gore Verbinski were executive producers of the album Rogues Gallery, Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs and Chanteys. Depp played the title role of Sweeney Todd in Tim Burton\\'s film adaptation of the musical , for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy . Depp thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and praised Tim Burton for his \"unwavering trust and support.\" Depp played the former Heath Ledger character in the 2009 film, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus along with Jude Law and Colin Farrell . All three actors gave their salaries from the film to Ledger\\'s daughter, Matilda. He portrayed the Mad Hatter in Burton\\'s Alice in Wonderland , and the titular character in Rango . Future roles Depp will appear in a film version of writer Hunter S. Thompson \\'s book, The Rum Diary , portraying the main character, Paul Kemp. In 2007, Depp accepted Warner Bros. \\' proposal to make a film of the gothic soap opera Dark Shadows , a series that aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971. He had been a fan as a child. Depp and Graham King will produce the movie with David Kennedy, who ran Dan Curtis Productions inc. until Curtis died in 2006. He will play Tonto in a future Lone Ranger film. Depp will also produce Hugo Cabret , based on the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret , film a documentary about Keith Richards , and have a cameo appearance in Jack & Jill . Depp will make a cameo appearance in a film adaptation of 21 Jump Street , the show he starred in during the late 1980s. Depp will star in and produce an adaptation of the comic book Rex Mundi . Depp will collaborate with Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides director Rob Marshall again to create a remake of The Thin Man . Depp also showed interest in starring in the next Sin City films, with Robert Rodriguez wanting him to star as Wallace . Collaboration with Tim Burton Depp has collaborated with director and close friend Tim Burton in seven films, beginning with Edward Scissorhands (1990), opposite Winona Ryder and Vincent Price . His next role with Burton was in the 1994 film, Ed Wood . Depp later said that \"within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed.\" At the time, the actor was depressed about films and filmmaking. This part gave him a \"chance to stretch out and have some fun\"; he said working with Landau \"rejuvenated my love for acting\". Producer Scott Rudin once said, \"Basically Johnny Depp is playing Tim Burton in all his movies,\" although Burton personally disapproved of the comment. Depp, however agrees with Rudin\\'s statement. According to Depp, Edward Scissorhands represented Burton\\'s inability to communicate as a teenager. Ed Wood reflected Burton\\'s relationship with Vincent Price (very similar with Edward D. Wood, Jr. and Béla Lugosi ). Depp\\'s Hollywood Walk of Fame star received on November 19, 1999Depp\\'s next venture with Burton was the role of Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow (1999), opposite Christina Ricci . Sleepy Hollow reflected Burton\\'s battle with the Hollywood studio system. For his performance, Depp took inspiration from Angela Lansbury , Roddy McDowall and Basil Rathbone . Depp stated, \"I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl.\" Depp did not work with Burton again until 2005 in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , in which he played Willy Wonka . Depp modeled the character\\'s hair on Anna Wintour . The film was a box office success and received positive critical reception. Gene Wilder , who played Willy Wonka in the 1971 film , initially criticized this version. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released in July, followed by Corpse Bride , for which Depp voiced the character Victor Van Dort, in September. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) followed, bringing Depp his second major award win, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy as well as his third nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor . Burton first gave him an original cast recording of the 1979 stage musical in 2000. Although not a fan of the musical genre, Depp grew to like the tale\\'s treatment. He cited Peter Lorre in Mad Love (1935) as his main influence for the role, and practiced the songs his character would perform while filming Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\\'s End . Although he had performed in musical groups, Depp was initially unsure that he would be able to sustain Stephen Sondheim \\'s lyrics. Depp recorded demos and worked with Bruce Witkin to shape his vocals without a qualified voice coach. In the DVD Reviews section, Entertainment Weekly \\' s Chris Nashawaty gave the film an A minus, stating, \"Depp\\'s soaring voice makes you wonder what other tricks he\\'s been hiding... Watching Depp\\'s barber wield his razors... it\\'s hard not to be reminded of Edward Scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago... and all of the twisted beauty we would\\'ve missed out on had [Burton and Depp] never met.\" In his introduction to Burton on Burton , a book of interviews with the director, Depp called Burton \"...a brother, a friend,...and [a] brave soul\". The next Depp-Burton collaboration was Alice in Wonderland (2010). Depp played the Mad Hatter alongside Helena Bonham Carter , Anne Hathaway and Alan Rickman . Other interests Depp in April 2011===Music=== As a guitar player, Depp has played slide guitar on the Oasis song \"Fade In-Out\" (from Be Here Now , 1997), as well as on \"Fade Away (Warchild Version)\" (b-side of the \" Don\\'t Go Away \" single). He also played acoustic guitar in the movie Chocolat and on the soundtrack to Once Upon a Time in Mexico . He is a friend of The Pogues \\' Shane MacGowan , and performed on MacGowan\\'s first solo album. He was also a member of P , a group featuring Butthole Surfers singer Gibby Haynes , Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones . He has appeared in Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers \\' music video \" Into the Great Wide Open \". Winemaker and restaurateur Depp and Paradis grow grapes and have wine making facilities in their vineyard in Plan-de-la-Tour north of Saint-Tropez . He is known for a fondness of French wines : among Depp\\'s favorites are the Bordeaux wines Château Calon-Ségur , Château Cheval Blanc and Château Pétrus , and the Burgundy wine Domaine de la Romanée-Conti . Interviewed in Madame Figaro , he stated, \"With those wines, you reach nirvana \". Along with Sean Penn , John Malkovich and Mick Hucknall , Depp co-owned the Parisian restaurant-bar Man Ray , located near the Champs-Élysées . Personal life Family and relationships Depp backstage at the Ahmanson Theatre on December 31, 2006Depp was engaged to actress Winona Ryder for three years beginning in July 1990. They met at the Great Balls of Fire! premiere in June 1989; two months later they began dating. The relationship was highly publicized and received much scrutiny by the media and tabloid press. Since 1998, following a four year relationship with British supermodel Kate Moss , Depp has had a relationship with Vanessa Paradis , a French actress and singer whom he met while filming The Ninth Gate . The couple have two children. Daughter Lily-Rose Melody Depp was born May 27, 1999, and son John \"Jack\" Christopher Depp III was born April 9, 2002. In 2007, his daughter recovered from a serious illness, an E. coli infection that began to cause her kidneys to shut down and resulted in an extended hospital stay. To thank Great Ormond Street Hospital , Depp visited the hospital in November 2007 dressed in his Captain Jack Sparrow outfit and spent 4 hours reading stories to the children. In 2008 he donated £1 million (about $2 million) to the hospital. Although Depp has not remarried, he has stated that having children has given him \"real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life, in work, in everything.\" \"You can\\'t plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful ride I was on. It was destiny ; kismet. All the math finally worked.\" The family divides its time between their home in Meudon , located in the suburbs of Paris, Los Angeles, an island he bought in The Bahamas , and their villa in Le Plan-de-la-Tour , a small town 20 km from Saint-Tropez , in the south of France. Depp also acquired a vineyard estate in the Plan-de-la-Tour area in 2007. Legal issues In 1994, Depp was arrested and questioned by police for allegedly causing serious damage to a New York City hotel suite. He was arrested again in 1999 for brawling with paparazzi outside a restaurant while dining in London with Paradis. Tattoos Depp has around 13 tattoos , many of them signifying important persons or events in his life. They include a Native American in profile and a ribbon reading \"Wino Forever\" (originally \"Winona Forever\", altered after his breakup with Winona Ryder) on his right biceps , \"Lily-Rose\" (his daughter\\'s name) over his heart, \"Betty Sue\" (his mother\\'s name) on his left biceps, and a sparrow flying over water with the word \"Jack\" (his son\\'s name; the sparrow is flying towards him rather than away from him as it is in Pirates of the Caribbean ) on his right forearm . Unannounced appearance on set On October 8, 2010, Depp made an unannounced appearance at a London Primary School near where he was filming scenes for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides . He turned up dressed as his character Jack Sparrow after receiving a letter from a pupil asking for his help with a class mutiny. Controversy Comments on U.S. In 2003, Depp\\'s comments about the United States appeared in Germany\\'s Stern magazine : \"America is dumb, is something like a dumb puppy that has big teeth — that can bite and hurt you, aggressive.\" Although he later asserted that the magazine misquoted him and the quotation was taken out of context, Stern stood by its story, as did CNN .com in its coverage of the interview. CNN added his remark that he would like his children \"to see America as a toy, a broken toy. Investigate it a little, check it out, get this feeling and then get out.\" The July 17, 2006 edition of Newsweek reprinted the \"dumb puppy\" quotation, verbatim, in the context of a Letter to the Magazine. Depp has also disagreed with subsequent media reports that he says paint him as a \"European wannabe\", saying that he likes the anonymity of living in France and his simpler life there.

Contents 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Soundtrack 4 Box Office 5 Reception 6 Trivia 7 Sources Plot While at the Springwood Diner with his friend Kris Fowles , Dean Russell fell asleep at the table and met a man covered in burn scars, wearing a red and green sweater and a clawed glove on his right hand. The burned man cut Dean\\'s throat in the Dream World , but in the physical world it appeared that Dean was cutting his own throat as friend and waitress Nancy Holbrook looked on with Kris. At Dean\\'s funeral, Kris saw a photograph of herself and Dean as children, but could not recall ever knowing Dean before high school. Kris then began to dream about the burned man herself and refused to go to sleep for fear that she would die in her dreams. Jesse Braun (Thomas Dekker), Kris\\'s ex-boyfriend, showed up at her house to keep her company while she slept, but Kris met the burned man in her dreams and was murdered. Covered in blood, Jesse ran to Nancy\\'s house to try to explain what happened. He learned that Nancy has also been having dreams about the same man. Jesse was apprehended by the police under suspicion of murdering Kris, and is killed by Freddy when he falls asleep in his jail cell. With her friends dying, Nancy begins to question what everyone\\'s connection is to each other, given that none of them can remember each other before their teenage years. Eventually, Nancy and her friend Quentin Smith discover that all of them, including more children, attended the same preschool together. Nancy\\'s mother, Gwen Holbrook , reluctantly tells Nancy and Quentin that there was a gardener at the preschool, Fred Krueger, who hurt Nancy and the rest of the kids. Gwen explains that Nancy was his favorite, and came home one day telling her mom about Freddy\\'s \"magic cave\" and the things that happened down there. Gwen claims Krueger skipped town before he was arrested. Nancy does not believe her and attempts to track down the remaining kids from the school. Nancy eventually discovers that all of the other kids, Lisa Harper, Bret Tanzer, Sukari McGill, Nancy Lumb, Elizabeth Cook, Marcus Yeon, Carrie Bush, and Craig Jackson, have been killed, most of them in their sleep. Meanwhile, Quentin tries to accept that everything is nothing more than repressed memories, but he falls asleep during swim practice and witnesses what really happened to Krueger. Quentin sees everyone\\'s parents hunt down Krueger, and then burn him alive. Quentin and Nancy confront Quentin\\'s father, Alan Smith , questioning the reality that they murdered Krueger with no actual evidence that he had committed any crime. Nancy and Quentin, who both begin sporadically dreaming while they are awake as a result of insomnia, decide to go to the preschool and learn what they can about Krueger. On the way, Nancy falls asleep and is attacked by Freddy, but when Quentin wakes her up they discover she has pulled a piece of Freddy\\'s sweater out of the dreamworld and into the physical world. Quentin takes Nancy to the hospital for cuts on her arm; there, he steals some adrenaline and a syringe to help them stay awake. Nancy and Quentin leave the hospital and eventually make it to the preschool. Quentin uncovers Krueger\\'s \"magic cave\" and the evidence that proves Krueger was physically and sexually abusing all of the children. Nancy decides the only way to end this is to pull Krueger out of their dreams and kill him in reality. Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Freddy, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger then goes after Nancy and explains that he intentionally left her for last so she would stay awake long enough that when she finally fell asleep she would no longer be able to wake back up. While Nancy struggles with Freddy, Quentin wakes and uses the adrenaline to bring Nancy up and pull Freddy into reality. With Krueger distracted by Quentin, Nancy uses a broken paper cutter blade to cut Freddy\\'s gloved hand off, and then slice his throat, seemingly killing him. Afterward, Nancy torches the secret room, with Krueger\\'s body left inside to burn, while she and Quentin leave. Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital, with Nancy being told she should gets some sleep. As they talk, a very much alive (in a sense) Krueger suddenly appears in a mirror\\'s reflection and kills Nancy\\'s mother before pulling her body through the mirror and Nancy screams.

Reception The film received very negative reviews from critics and fans. Based on 165 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, A Nightmare on Elm Street holds a 15% overall rating from critics, with an average score of 3.7 out of 10, The consensus at Rotten Tomatoes was that the film was \"visually faithful but lacking the depth and subversive twists that made the original so memorable, the Nightmare on Elm Street remake lives up to its title in the worst possible way.\" By comparison, Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 35, based on 25 reviews. CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade cinemagoers gave the film was a \"C-plus\" on an A+ to F scale, with exit polls showing that audiences were evenly divided between males and females, with 40 percent between 18–24 years of age and 20 percent under 18. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave it a \"B–\" and concluded that, \"I did jump a few times, and I liked Haley\\'s dour malevolence, but overall, the new Nightmare on Elm Street is a by-the-numbers bad dream that plays a little too much like a corporately ordered rerun. One, two, Freddy\\'s coming for you. Three, four, we\\'ve been there before\". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the acting calling it \"lethargically lifeless\" and criticized Haley\\'s portrayal of Krueger, saying, \"Even with his electronically deepened voice and a pointless amount of backstory, there\\'s just no replacing Englund\". Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1 star out of 4, writing in his review, \"I stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what? Are we supposed to be scared? Is the sudden clanging chord supposed to evoke a fearful Pavlovian response?\" Trivia Katie Cassidy who plays Kris Fowles and Thomas Dekker who plays Jesse Braun both starred in the same episode of 7th Heaven , \" Red Socks \" (2005). Aaron Yoo plays the role of Chewie in the reboot of Friday the 13th . He also plays the role of Marcus Yeon in this remake. Therefore he plays two characters in the A Nightmare On Elm Street / Friday the 13th universes. A Nightmare On Elm Street won \"Best Horror Film\" at the 2011 People\\'s Choice Awards, though its reception was very negative. Some soundtracks from the original movie are used in this film. This film reuses concepts from all the films to date in the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series. Some scenes from the original film are almost shot to shot in the remake. Some New Nightmare aspects are lamp shade hanging; but difficult to spot unless one is from Chicago. There are some quotes from the original Freddy that are used by the remake Freddy.

It is a book adaptation of the film of the same name . It shouldn\\'t be confused with the novelization of the film of the same name . Differences from the film The book doesn\\'t have the pre-dream opening scene. It goes straight to Kristen Parker \\'s dream. The girl on the tricycle says \"hello\" instead of \"hi\". The girl on the tricycle says \"I have to go now.\" instead of \"I gotta go now.\". The girl on the tricycle says \"bye\" to Kristen. Where Kristen says \"Wait! Little girl! Don\\'t go in there!\" in the film, the words \"little girl\" are left out. The part where Kristen calls \"Little girl!\" to the girl on the tricyle inside the house is left out. When Kristen Park and the girl on the tricycle are in the Dream World \\'s boiler room, and furnace opens up and Kristen sees inside it. It contains charred bones, ashes, and a tricycle \"identical to the little girl\\'s- only charred\". The implication is rather obvious. The line \"Put me down. You\\'re hurting me.\" is left out. One has to wonder if something is being implied by this line in the film. Instead of Kristen screaming, the corpse of the girl who had been on the tricycle screams. Kristen looks at her and notices that she is dead BEFORE this happens. When the tricycle rolls into Kristen\\'s room at Westin Hills Psychiatric Hospital , it\\'s simply described as \"leaving tire tracks\". No mention is made of the tire tracks apparently being made in blood, like in the film. The line, \"Welcome to prime time, bitch!\" is left out. Where Nancy Thompson said \"Let him go, you bastard.\" in the film, the word \"bastard\" is replaced by the word \"creep\". Where Freddy Krueger wrote \"Come and get him, bitch.\" on Joey\\'s chest in the film, the word \"bitch\" is left out. In Penny Bros. Auto Salvage , the line \"Bury the fucking thing!\" is left out.

Key characters include Nancy (Rooney Mara), Quentin (Kyle Gallner), Kris Fowles (Katie Cassidy), and Freddy himself (Jackie Earle Haley). Themes explore the blurred line between dreams and reality, the impact of unresolved trauma, and the consequences of vigilante justice.

He has one brother, Daniel, who is a novelist, and two sisters, Christie (now his personal manager) and Debbie. His parents divorced when he was a teenager and his mother married, as her second husband, Robert Palmer (died 2000), whom Depp called \"an inspiration to me\". The Depp family in the United States began with a French Huguenot immigrant, Pierre Deppe or Dieppe, who settled in Virginia around 1700, part of a refugee colony situated above the falls on the James River. The actor has also surmised that he is part Native American , saying in 2011, \"I guess I have some Native American [in me] somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American, she grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek.\" The family moved frequently during Depp\\'s childhood, and he and his siblings lived in more than 20 different locations, settling in Miramar , Florida, in 1970. In 1978, Depp\\'s parents divorced. He engaged in self-harm as a child, due to the stress of dealing with family problems. He has seven or eight self-inflicted scars. In a 1993 interview, he explained his self-injury by saying, \"My body is a journal in a way. It\\'s like what sailors used to do, where every tattoo meant something, a specific time in your life when you make a mark on yourself, whether you do it yourself with a knife or with a professional tattoo artist\". 1980s With the gift of a guitar from his mother when he was 12, Depp began playing in various garage bands . His first band was in honor of his girlfriend, Meredith. A year after his parents\\' divorce, Depp dropped out of high school to become a rock musician. As he said on Inside the Actors Studio , he attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician. He played with The Kids, a band that enjoyed modest local success. The Kids set out together for Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method, but the group split up before signing a record deal. Depp subsequently collaborated with the band Rock City Angels and co-wrote their song \"Mary\", which appeared on Rock City Angels\\' debut for Geffen Records titled Young Man\\'s Blues . On December 24, 1983, Depp married Lori Anne Allison, a makeup artist and sister of his band\\'s bass player and singer. During Depp\\'s marriage, his wife worked as a makeup artist while he worked a variety of odd jobs, including a telemarketer for pens. His wife introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage , who advised Depp to pursue an acting career. They divorced in 1985. Depp later dated and was engaged to Sherilyn Fenn (whom he met on the set of the 1985 short film Dummies ). Both Sherilyn Fenn and Depp auditioned for the 1986 film Thrashin\\' and they were both cast, with Depp being chosen by the film\\'s director to star as the lead, which would have been Depp\\'s first major role. Depp was later turned down by the film\\'s producer who rejected the directors decision. Career Johnny Depp at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival ===Television=== Depp starred in a lead role on the Fox TV television series, 21 Jump Street , which premiered in 1987. Depp accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest , who inspired him. Depp\\'s long time friend Sal Jenco joined the cast as a semi-co-star as the janitor named Blowfish. The series\\' success turned Depp into a popular teen idol during the late 1980s. He felt \"forced into the role of product.\" Depp decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him. Film roles Depp\\'s first major role was in the 1984 classic horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street , playing the boyfriend of the heroine, Nancy Thompson , (played by Heather Langenkamp ) and one of \\'s victims. He originally went with his friend Jackie Earle Haley as company while he auditioned for a part in the film, however, Depp was given a role instead as Glen Lantz while 26 years later Haley would get the part of Freddy Krueger in the remake. Depp was the first choice and was cast to star in the now classic, 1986 American skater drama film Thrashin\\' , chosen and cast by the director but ultimately rejected by the film\\'s producer. In 1986, he appeared in a secondary role as a Vietnamese -speaking private in Oliver Stone \\'s Platoon . In 1990 he undertook the quirky title role of the Tim Burton film, Edward Scissorhands . The film\\'s success began his long association with Burton. Depp, a fan and long-time friend of writer Hunter S. Thompson , played a version of Thompson (named Raoul Duke ) in 1998\\'s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , based on the writer\\'s pseudobiographical novel of the same name. Depp accompanied Thompson as his road manager on one of the author\\'s last book tours. In 2006, Depp contributed a foreword to Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson , a posthumous biography published by ammobooks.com. Depp paid for most of Thompson\\'s memorial event, complete with fireworks and the shooting of Thompson\\'s ashes by a cannon, in Aspen , Colorado, where Thompson lived. Critics have described Depp\\'s roles as characters who are \"iconic loners.\" Depp has noted this period of his career was full of \"studio defined failures\" and films that were \"box office poison,\" but he thought the studios never understood the films and did not do a good job of marketing. Depp has chosen roles which he found interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office. Depp wearing a mustache and goatee similar to the style used in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl The 2003 Walt Disney Pictures film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a major success, in which Depp\\'s performance as the suave pirate Captain Jack Sparrow was highly praised. Studio bosses were more ambivalent at first, but the character became popular with the movie-going public. According to a survey taken by Fandango , Depp was a major draw for audiences. The film\\'s director, Gore Verbinski , has said that Depp\\'s character closely resembles the actor\\'s personality, but Depp said he modeled the character after Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards . Depp was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for the role. In 2004, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor , for playing Scottish author J. M. Barrie in the film Finding Neverland . Depp next starred as Willy Wonka in the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , a major success at the box office and earning him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy . Depp returned to the role of Jack Sparrow for the sequel Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\\'s Chest , which opened on July 7, 2006 and grossed $135.5 million in the first three days of its U.S. release, breaking a box office record of the highest weekend tally. The next sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean , At World\\'s End , was released May 24, 2007. Depp has said that Sparrow is \"definitely a big part of me\", and he wants to play the role in further sequels. Depp voiced Sparrow in the video game, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow . Johnny Depp\\'s swashbuckling sword talents as developed for the character of Jack Sparrow , were highlighted in the documentary film Reclaiming the Blade . Within the film, Swordmaster Bob Anderson shared his experiences working with Depp on the choreography for The Curse of the Black Pearl . Anderson, who also trained Errol Flynn , another famous Hollywood pirate, described in the film Depp\\'s ability as an actor to pick up the sword to be \"about as good as you can get.\" Depp and Gore Verbinski were executive producers of the album Rogues Gallery, Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs and Chanteys. Depp played the title role of Sweeney Todd in Tim Burton\\'s film adaptation of the musical , for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy . Depp thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and praised Tim Burton for his \"unwavering trust and support.\" Depp played the former Heath Ledger character in the 2009 film, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus along with Jude Law and Colin Farrell . All three actors gave their salaries from the film to Ledger\\'s daughter, Matilda. He portrayed the Mad Hatter in Burton\\'s Alice in Wonderland , and the titular character in Rango . Future roles Depp will appear in a film version of writer Hunter S. Thompson \\'s book, The Rum Diary , portraying the main character, Paul Kemp. In 2007, Depp accepted Warner Bros. \\' proposal to make a film of the gothic soap opera Dark Shadows , a series that aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971. He had been a fan as a child. Depp and Graham King will produce the movie with David Kennedy, who ran Dan Curtis Productions inc. until Curtis died in 2006. He will play Tonto in a future Lone Ranger film. Depp will also produce Hugo Cabret , based on the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret , film a documentary about Keith Richards , and have a cameo appearance in Jack & Jill . Depp will make a cameo appearance in a film adaptation of 21 Jump Street , the show he starred in during the late 1980s. Depp will star in and produce an adaptation of the comic book Rex Mundi . Depp will collaborate with Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides director Rob Marshall again to create a remake of The Thin Man . Depp also showed interest in starring in the next Sin City films, with Robert Rodriguez wanting him to star as Wallace . Collaboration with Tim Burton Depp has collaborated with director and close friend Tim Burton in seven films, beginning with Edward Scissorhands (1990), opposite Winona Ryder and Vincent Price . His next role with Burton was in the 1994 film, Ed Wood . Depp later said that \"within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed.\" At the time, the actor was depressed about films and filmmaking. This part gave him a \"chance to stretch out and have some fun\"; he said working with Landau \"rejuvenated my love for acting\". Producer Scott Rudin once said, \"Basically Johnny Depp is playing Tim Burton in all his movies,\" although Burton personally disapproved of the comment. Depp, however agrees with Rudin\\'s statement. According to Depp, Edward Scissorhands represented Burton\\'s inability to communicate as a teenager. Ed Wood reflected Burton\\'s relationship with Vincent Price (very similar with Edward D. Wood, Jr. and Béla Lugosi ). Depp\\'s Hollywood Walk of Fame star received on November 19, 1999Depp\\'s next venture with Burton was the role of Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow (1999), opposite Christina Ricci . Sleepy Hollow reflected Burton\\'s battle with the Hollywood studio system. For his performance, Depp took inspiration from Angela Lansbury , Roddy McDowall and Basil Rathbone . Depp stated, \"I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl.\" Depp did not work with Burton again until 2005 in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , in which he played Willy Wonka . Depp modeled the character\\'s hair on Anna Wintour . The film was a box office success and received positive critical reception. Gene Wilder , who played Willy Wonka in the 1971 film , initially criticized this version. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released in July, followed by Corpse Bride , for which Depp voiced the character Victor Van Dort, in September. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) followed, bringing Depp his second major award win, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy as well as his third nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor . Burton first gave him an original cast recording of the 1979 stage musical in 2000. Although not a fan of the musical genre, Depp grew to like the tale\\'s treatment. He cited Peter Lorre in Mad Love (1935) as his main influence for the role, and practiced the songs his character would perform while filming Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\\'s End . Although he had performed in musical groups, Depp was initially unsure that he would be able to sustain Stephen Sondheim \\'s lyrics. Depp recorded demos and worked with Bruce Witkin to shape his vocals without a qualified voice coach. In the DVD Reviews section, Entertainment Weekly \\' s Chris Nashawaty gave the film an A minus, stating, \"Depp\\'s soaring voice makes you wonder what other tricks he\\'s been hiding... Watching Depp\\'s barber wield his razors... it\\'s hard not to be reminded of Edward Scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago... and all of the twisted beauty we would\\'ve missed out on had [Burton and Depp] never met.\" In his introduction to Burton on Burton , a book of interviews with the director, Depp called Burton \"...a brother, a friend,...and [a] brave soul\". The next Depp-Burton collaboration was Alice in Wonderland (2010). Depp played the Mad Hatter alongside Helena Bonham Carter , Anne Hathaway and Alan Rickman . Other interests Depp in April 2011===Music=== As a guitar player, Depp has played slide guitar on the Oasis song \"Fade In-Out\" (from Be Here Now , 1997), as well as on \"Fade Away (Warchild Version)\" (b-side of the \" Don\\'t Go Away \" single). He also played acoustic guitar in the movie Chocolat and on the soundtrack to Once Upon a Time in Mexico . He is a friend of The Pogues \\' Shane MacGowan , and performed on MacGowan\\'s first solo album. He was also a member of P , a group featuring Butthole Surfers singer Gibby Haynes , Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones . He has appeared in Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers \\' music video \" Into the Great Wide Open \". Winemaker and restaurateur Depp and Paradis grow grapes and have wine making facilities in their vineyard in Plan-de-la-Tour north of Saint-Tropez . He is known for a fondness of French wines : among Depp\\'s favorites are the Bordeaux wines Château Calon-Ségur , Château Cheval Blanc and Château Pétrus , and the Burgundy wine Domaine de la Romanée-Conti . Interviewed in Madame Figaro , he stated, \"With those wines, you reach nirvana \". Along with Sean Penn , John Malkovich and Mick Hucknall , Depp co-owned the Parisian restaurant-bar Man Ray , located near the Champs-Élysées . Personal life Family and relationships Depp backstage at the Ahmanson Theatre on December 31, 2006Depp was engaged to actress Winona Ryder for three years beginning in July 1990. They met at the Great Balls of Fire! premiere in June 1989; two months later they began dating. The relationship was highly publicized and received much scrutiny by the media and tabloid press. Since 1998, following a four year relationship with British supermodel Kate Moss , Depp has had a relationship with Vanessa Paradis , a French actress and singer whom he met while filming The Ninth Gate . The couple have two children. Daughter Lily-Rose Melody Depp was born May 27, 1999, and son John \"Jack\" Christopher Depp III was born April 9, 2002. In 2007, his daughter recovered from a serious illness, an E. coli infection that began to cause her kidneys to shut down and resulted in an extended hospital stay. To thank Great Ormond Street Hospital , Depp visited the hospital in November 2007 dressed in his Captain Jack Sparrow outfit and spent 4 hours reading stories to the children. In 2008 he donated £1 million (about $2 million) to the hospital. Although Depp has not remarried, he has stated that having children has given him \"real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life, in work, in everything.\" \"You can\\'t plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful ride I was on. It was destiny ; kismet. All the math finally worked.\" The family divides its time between their home in Meudon , located in the suburbs of Paris, Los Angeles, an island he bought in The Bahamas , and their villa in Le Plan-de-la-Tour , a small town 20 km from Saint-Tropez , in the south of France. Depp also acquired a vineyard estate in the Plan-de-la-Tour area in 2007. Legal issues In 1994, Depp was arrested and questioned by police for allegedly causing serious damage to a New York City hotel suite. He was arrested again in 1999 for brawling with paparazzi outside a restaurant while dining in London with Paradis. Tattoos Depp has around 13 tattoos , many of them signifying important persons or events in his life. They include a Native American in profile and a ribbon reading \"Wino Forever\" (originally \"Winona Forever\", altered after his breakup with Winona Ryder) on his right biceps , \"Lily-Rose\" (his daughter\\'s name) over his heart, \"Betty Sue\" (his mother\\'s name) on his left biceps, and a sparrow flying over water with the word \"Jack\" (his son\\'s name; the sparrow is flying towards him rather than away from him as it is in Pirates of the Caribbean ) on his right forearm . Unannounced appearance on set On October 8, 2010, Depp made an unannounced appearance at a London Primary School near where he was filming scenes for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides . He turned up dressed as his character Jack Sparrow after receiving a letter from a pupil asking for his help with a class mutiny. Controversy Comments on U.S. In 2003, Depp\\'s comments about the United States appeared in Germany\\'s Stern magazine : \"America is dumb, is something like a dumb puppy that has big teeth — that can bite and hurt you, aggressive.\" Although he later asserted that the magazine misquoted him and the quotation was taken out of context, Stern stood by its story, as did CNN .com in its coverage of the interview. CNN added his remark that he would like his children \"to see America as a toy, a broken toy. Investigate it a little, check it out, get this feeling and then get out.\" The July 17, 2006 edition of Newsweek reprinted the \"dumb puppy\" quotation, verbatim, in the context of a Letter to the Magazine. Depp has also disagreed with subsequent media reports that he says paint him as a \"European wannabe\", saying that he likes the anonymity of living in France and his simpler life there.

      "    reasoning='Based on the user\\'s question about similarities between Batman comics and movies, I am considering the provided context, which details various Batman films, comic works, and their influences. The context highlights how movies like Tim Burton\\'s Batman, Christopher Nolan\\'s Dark Knight Trilogy, and others draw from comic sources, such as Frank Miller\\'s \"The Dark Knight\" series, while adapting elements for cinematic appeal. The student\\'s goal is to explore similarities and differences in storylines, characters, and themes to assess accuracy and evolution, so my response should address these directly. The pragmatic need suggests the user wants practical insights for content consumption or discussions, so I\\'ll make the answer anticipatory by noting key comparisons, potential discrepancies (e.g., comics often have darker, more complex themes, while movies adapt for broader audiences), and suggestions for next steps to encourage engagement. This approach ensures the answer is cooperative, informative, and proactive in handling follow-ups, such as asking for specific examples or recommendations.',\n",
      "    cooperative_answer='Yes, Batman comics and movies share many core similarities, but there are also notable differences in how storylines, characters, and themes are adapted, which can affect how faithfully the essence of the comics is captured. For instance, both mediums feature Batman\\'s origin as Bruce Wayne, his fight against villains like the Joker and Two-Face, and themes of justice, vigilantism, and moral ambiguity. Comics like Frank Miller\\'s \"The Dark Knight\" have directly influenced movies, such as Christopher Nolan\\'s trilogy (e.g., \"The Dark Knight Rises\" borrows elements like Batman\\'s retirement and return, as well as his confrontations with foes). However, movies often simplify complex comic storylines for runtime and audience appeal, resulting in a more action-oriented or visually spectacular take—Nolan\\'s films emphasize realism and psychological depth, while earlier ones like Tim Burton\\'s are more gothic and stylized. Comics tend to explore darker, more introspective themes and multiple timelines, which might not translate perfectly to films due to budget or rating constraints.\\n\\nTo help you decide if the movies capture the comics\\' essence, consider starting with Nolan\\'s trilogy if you want a closer adaptation of the gritty comic style, or the 1989 \"Batman\" for a fun, visual contrast. If you\\'re looking at accuracy, comics like \"The Dark Knight Returns\" offer a raw, dystopian edge that films sometimes tone down. Would you like recommendations on specific comics to compare with a movie, or details on how a particular character evolves across media? This can guide your enjoyment or discussions further.',\n",

Christian Bale was cast in the title role along with Michael Caine as Alfred , Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox .

Contents 1 Sypnosis 2 Issues 3 Publication history 4 Influence 4.1 Comics 4.2 Film 4.3 Animation 4.4 Television 4.5 Video Games Sypnosis The Dark Knight is set in a dystopian near-future version of Gotham City . The year is never specified, though it has been a full decade since the last reported sighting of Batman. Society has lost faith in the functioning of justice, and the current American President, named only Dickard , and whose appearance seems to be a reference to Ronald Reagan, constantly tries to keep the social order with optimistic discourses, while the Cold War is still ongoing. Virtually all superheroes, with the exception of Superman , have been forced by governmental authorities into retirement or otherwise driven away by a distrusting populace. Bruce Wayne has voluntarily retired from crime fighting following the death (under unspecified circumstances) of Jason Todd , the second Robin . In the absence of superheroes, criminals run amok, and a gang called the Mutants terrorize Gotham City. The return of an old enemy prompts a now 55-year-old Wayne to don the Batman costume once again. Despite Wayne\\'s funding his rehabilitation, including plastic surgery to restore his half-disfigured face, Harvey \" Two-Face \" Dent has seemingly returned to crime. Batman apprehends Dent, but the populace debates whether Batman\\'s brand of vigilantism has any place in society. The media plays a large role in DKR , with the narrative broken up by news reports and \"talking head\" editorials debating events in the story as they unfold. After Batman saves her from a Mutant attack, 13-year-old Carrie Kelly buys herself a knock-off Robin costume, and searches for Batman to aid him. She finds Batman at the city dump, where he is fighting the Mutants. The Mutants\\' leader defeats Batman in combat, but Kelly distracts him and pulls Batman into the tank-like Batmobile . Kelly attends to Batman’s wounds as the vehicle drives toward the Batcave . Once home, Batman takes Carrie on as the new Robin despite his butler Alfred\\'s objections. With the help of retiring Commissioner James Gordon , the Mutants\\' leader is allowed to escape from jail, and Batman beats him in a mud fight in front of the assembled gang, which then disbands as a result of his humiliation. Some former Mutants create a new gang, the \"Sons of the Batman,\" using extremely violent methods (up to and including murder) to \"purge\" Gotham of its criminal element in what they see as emulation of Batman\\'s actions. Meanwhile, the return of Batman has caused one of his oldest and deadliest foes, The Joker , to awaken from a years-long catatonic state at Arkham Asylum . The Joker convinces his psychiatrist, Dr. Bartholomew Wolper, that he is sane and regrets his misdeeds. Seeking to discredit Batman, whom he has crusaded against in the media, Wolper appears with the Joker on a late-night show. While the police, now led by the anti-vigilante Commissioner Ellen Yindel , attack Batman, the Joker murders everyone in the television studio (including Wolper) and escapes. Batman and Robin track the Joker to a county fair, where Batman defeats Joker in a violent showdown. Batman stops short of killing the Joker; however, the Joker finishes the job himself, twisting his own broken neck, with the intent that the police will charge Batman with murder. Batman escapes, but not before another confrontation with the Gotham police, and a citywide manhunt is now on for the Caped Crusader. After Superman diverts a Russian nuclear warhead which then detonates in a desert, millions of tons of dust and debris fill the atmosphere, and Gotham descends into chaos during the resulting blackout. Batman and Robin train former Mutants and the brutal Sons of the Batman in non-lethal fighting to stop looting and ensure the flow of needed supplies. In the midst of nuclear winter conditions, Gotham becomes the safest city in America; the U.S. government, seeing this as a credibility-undermining embarrassment, orders Superman to take Batman down. Having been warned of the government\\'s plans by Oliver Queen, the former Green Arrow, Batman confronts Superman. Symbolically, their duel takes place in Crime Alley , where Bruce Wayne\\'s parents were murdered decades earlier. Batman defeats Superman in a well planned fight, but dies from a heart attack immediately afterward. After his funeral, it is revealed that his death was staged as an elaborate ruse; Clark Kent attends the funeral and gives Robin a knowing wink after hearing Bruce\\'s heartbeat as he leaves the grave site, suggesting his silent approval of what will happen next. Alfred destroys the Batcave and Wayne Manor and suffers a fatal stroke. Some time afterward, Batman leads Robin, Green Arrow, and the rest of his followers into the caverns beyond the Batcave and prepares to continue his fight. His plan, which will take years of training and studying, is to build an army, and to bring sense to a world plagued by something \"worse than thieves and murderers\". He decides that this will be a good life — good enough. Issues The Dark Knight Returns The Dark Knight Triumphant Hunt the Dark Knight The Dark Knight Falls Publication history The original indicia of each issue states that the series was titled Batman: The Dark Knight . Several early collected editions also left out the words Returns from the cover title. Influence Comics Batman: The Dark Knight is often heralded as one of the biggest influences on the Modern Age of Comic Books , alongside Alan Moore \\'s Watchmen . The series notably revitalized interest in Batman, which had been waning since the 1970s. Although not the first Batman work to implement a darker tone, the series helped popularize grimmer takes on the character and move away from light-hearted approaches, which were heavily associated with him due to the popularity of the 1960s series . Elements of Batman\\'s costumes, specifically short ears on the cowl and pouch-based Utility Belt , would be adapted into other variations and artists\\' designs. The evaluation of the character\\'s psychology would be in other works, including Grant Morrison \\'s Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth . Original characters from the series, such as Carrie Kelley and the Mutants , have also appeared in the main-continuities and other depictions. Several art pieces from the series, notably Batman crouching on a line , have appeared throughout the franchise and promotional work. Plot points from the series would also make it into DC\\'s New Earth and Prime Earth, notably the death of Jason Todd . Several moments of Batman\\'s origin, notably discovering the Batcave as a child and the pearls falling from his mother\\'s neck, also originate from the series. The Exoframe Batsuit used in the battle with Superman has also inspired other armors used by Batman to fight superpowered enemies, such as the Thrasher Suit and Justice Buster Batsuit . Elements of the story have also appeared in works related to Superman and Green Arrow . Film Tim Burton , director of the 1989 Batman film and Batman Returns , cited Batman: The Dark Knight as great influence on his works with the character. Joel Schumacher had also pitched a live-action adaptation of the series to Warner Bros. after finishing Batman Forever and the later cancelation of Batman Unchained . However, both times had the proposal shelved in favor of both Batman & Robin and Batman: DarKnight , respectively. Christopher Nolan \\'s would take several influences from Miller\\'s Batman: The Dark Knight . The most consistent over the films including the Tumbler (the films\\' version of the Batmobile ) being a large military vehicle intended for warfare like the Riot Tank Batmobile used in the comic. The second film, The Dark Knight , also features a group of vigilante copycats similar to the Sons of Batman . The third film in the trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises , takes the most influence from the series and even lifts several plotlines. The most notable include a retired Batman returning to fight crime after years of absence, the GCPD learning of it when he intervenes in a car chase, his confrontations with Bane mirroring both fights with the Mutant Leader , and Bruce Wayne faking his death to find a life away from the cowl. Batman also uses a Mechanized Leg Brace to enhance his strength, having lost much of it over years of retirement. The 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice also took heavy influence from The Dark Knight comic series, even featuring many visual and dialogue references to the series. The film\\'s depiction of Batman also takes influence from the series\\' version, including the character being at middle-age, wearing a similar Batsuit design , and being depicted as more brutal and willing to use lethal force. The film also takes pieces of dialogue and moments are directly lifted from the series, most notably Alfred \\'s concerns about the lack of future Wayne generations, Superman being weakened by a nuclear weapon\\'s detonation, and the hostage situation from The Dark Knight Triumphant (though the film switches the toddler with Martha Kent and shows a decisively lethal outcome for the captor). The fight with Superman also takes many elements of the climax, such as Batman using an heavily-armored Batsuit , using ultra-sonic weaponry to cause a sensory overload, and using Kryptonite gas to weaken his opponent. The 2019 film Joker also lifts the talk-show scene from the comic, with its host Murray Franklin being based on David Endocrine . The Riot Tank Batmobile also appears in new material filmed for scene for the director\\'s cut of Justice League , appearing in the \"Knightmare\" post-credits scene. Animation The New Batman Adventures would adapt the second issue ( The Dark Knight Triumphant ) as a segment in the episode \" Legends of the Dark Knight \". However, the story was heavily condensed and the segment removes several moments to retain a family audience, such as Batman shooting a member of the mutants and the initial encounter with the Mutant Leader. In The Batman animated series episode \" Artifacts \", a future version of the series\\' Batman bares a muscular similar to the comic\\'s version, such as the muscular design, larger bat-symbol and use of strength-enhancing technology. The Batman: The Brave and the Bold also pays homage to The Dark Knight Returns in the episode \" The Rise of the Blue Beetle! \", with the cover appearing as a poster on Jamie Reyes\\' bedroom wall. The entire series was adapted into an animated feature directed by Jay Oliva and released in two parts from September, 2012 to January, 2013. A combination of the two was released on October 2013. Television In the TV series Gotham , the episode \" The Gentle Art of Making Enemies \" has a confrontation between Bruce Wayne and Jerome Valeska (the series\\' first incarnation of the Joker) take place in a Hall of Mirrors. The comic\\'s depiction of the Joker was also used as influence for Jerome\\'s brother Jeremiah Valeska , such as him being render catatonic and returning after Bruce\\'s return ten years later. The Arrowverse also features a version of Batman based on the comic\\'s version of the character, with references to antagonism with Superman and dialogue lifted straight from the series\\' climax. Video Games The video game Batman: Arkham Knight features a version of the Batmobile that can turn into a riot-response tank similar to the series\\' version of the vehicle. The game implies the design was chosen due to something darker taking control of his psyche and influencing him to implement these. However, the riot-tank features of the Batmobile are decisively non-lethal, whereas the comic\\'s is implied to be capable of deadly force but never used.', 'The Dark Knight General Information Type: Limited Series Total Issues: 4 Published: February – June 1986 Creators: Frank Miller Lynn Varley Batman: The Dark Knight is a four issue mini-series written and drawn by acclaimed author Frank Miller , first published by DC Comics in 1986.

      "    response='Yes, Batman comics and movies share many core similarities, but there are also notable differences in how storylines, characters, and themes are adapted, which can affect how faithfully the essence of the comics is captured. For instance, both mediums feature Batman\\'s origin as Bruce Wayne, his fight against villains like the Joker and Two-Face, and themes of justice, vigilantism, and moral ambiguity. Comics like Frank Miller\\'s \"The Dark Knight\" have directly influenced movies, such as Christopher Nolan\\'s trilogy (e.g., \"The Dark Knight Rises\" borrows elements like Batman\\'s retirement and return, as well as his confrontations with foes). However, movies often simplify complex comic storylines for runtime and audience appeal, resulting in a more action-oriented or visually spectacular take—Nolan\\'s films emphasize realism and psychological depth, while earlier ones like Tim Burton\\'s are more gothic and stylized. Comics tend to explore darker, more introspective themes and multiple timelines, which might not translate perfectly to films due to budget or rating constraints.\\n\\nTo help you decide if the movies capture the comics\\' essence, consider starting with Nolan\\'s trilogy if you want a closer adaptation of the gritty comic style, or the 1989 \"Batman\" for a fun, visual contrast. If you\\'re looking at accuracy, comics like \"The Dark Knight Returns\" offer a raw, dystopian edge that films sometimes tone down. Would you like recommendations on specific comics to compare with a movie, or details on how a particular character evolves across media? This can guide your enjoyment or discussions further.'\n",

As the Waynes\\' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father\\'s business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler, Alfred Pennyworth , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents\\' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City. As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named Ethan Bennett . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\". As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents\\' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot. For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman\\'s activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police Angel Rojas took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named Ellen Yin , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham. In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date – the Joker . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes. The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham\\'s underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named Bane . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of the Penguin , Man-Bat , Killer Croc , Cluemaster and Catwoman . One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce\\'s career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface. Some time later, a new character entered the Batman\\'s life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally. Barbara Gordon , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordan , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend Poison Ivy from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara\\'s aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt. The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist Dick Grayson was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named Tony Zucco . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick\\'s acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force. Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself John Jones . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called the Joining . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth\\'s atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John\\'s behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as Lex Luthor . At some point later, in the year 2027, Mr. Freeze had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named Nightwing . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever. One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave\\'s titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman\\'s legacy survived into the future.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill.

Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang.

He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23.

For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer.

Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition.

Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker.

The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers .

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate . His primary form of combat is a harmonious mixture of Jui-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Judo, Muay Thai, Savate, Karate, Kung Fu, Boxing, Capoeira, Krav Maga, Aikido, and Ninjutsu. Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations.

Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone.

His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21.

He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber.

He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition.

Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons.

Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

As the Waynes\\' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father\\'s business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler, Alfred Pennyworth , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents\\' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City. As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named Ethan Bennett . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\". As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents\\' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot. For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman\\'s activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police Angel Rojas took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named Ellen Yin , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham. In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date – the Joker . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes. The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham\\'s underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named Bane . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of the Penguin , Man-Bat , Killer Croc , Cluemaster and Catwoman . One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce\\'s career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface. Some time later, a new character entered the Batman\\'s life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally. Barbara Gordon , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordan , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend Poison Ivy from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara\\'s aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt. The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist Dick Grayson was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named Tony Zucco . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick\\'s acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force. Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself John Jones . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called the Joining . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth\\'s atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John\\'s behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as Lex Luthor . At some point later, in the year 2027, Mr. Freeze had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named Nightwing . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever. One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave\\'s titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman\\'s legacy survived into the future.

His personal favourite was the Gray Ghost , watching the television show with his father. On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to Wonder Woman , Bruce hadn\\'t been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes\\' faithful friend and butler, Alfred Pennyworth Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from Yoru Sensei . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor\\'s daughter Zatanna became very close. As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with Andrea Beaumont . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\". War on Crime Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the Batcave . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city\\'s underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in Dick Grayson as his ward after witnessing his parents\\' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down their murderer . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and Commissioner James Gordon , working with them to control crime in Gotham. Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included the Penguin , Poison Ivy , Mr. Freeze and the Scarecrow . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including Catwoman and Two-Face . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered the Joker , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created. New Adventures Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as Batwoman . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called Batgirl began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father\\'s legacy as the next Police Commissioner. Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned Tim Drake from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder. Joining Up For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called Blüdhaven . Batman would later find himself in Metropolis , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with Lex Luthor , Batman would find himself working with Superman to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker\\'s plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue\\'s gallery. He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another\\'s home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity. Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper. It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world\\'s greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League. Saving the World Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech\\'s deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station\\'s antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J\\'onn J\\'onzz\\' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna\\'s destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch. Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman\\'s mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don\\'t even think about it\". When the Imperium\\'s attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation. Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J\\'onn J\\'onzz. After freeing J\\'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J\\'onn J\\'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of Wonder Woman . The Flash arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing\\'s severed wing. After J\\'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium\\'s invasion of Mars , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium\\'s factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun\\'s rays. The heroes split up to disable the factories. Batman went to Giza, Egypt with Wonder Woman and J\\'onn J\\'onzz. The trio infiltrated the factory and found the Ion Matrix Crystal, a vital component of the plant. Batman and Wonder Woman provided a diversion to allow J\\'onzz to remove the crystal. As he removed the crystal, J\\'onzz was incapacitated by Imperium forces. Batman then covered Wonder Woman and J\\'onzz\\' escape from the plant, but was himself trapped inside and cornered by Imperium forces. J\\'onzz reported that Batman was dead, but in truth, he had mentally shielded Batman to prevent the Imperium forces from detecting him. Batman remained hidden until the Imperium arrived on Earth. He then revealed himself and reversed the ion charge in the Ion Matrix Crystal, causing the plant to burn off the smoke it had been producing. With the sun shining again, the heroes defeated the Imperium and freed their human prisoners, then mopped up the remaining Imperium forces around the globe. Inspired by a general\\'s speech about vigilance and the possible return of the invaders, Batman had the Watchtower constructed by Wayne Enterprises, hiding the funding as a \"line item in the aerospace R&D budget\". Batman invited the other six heroes who had repelled the invaders to the station. The seven heroes formed the Justice League. Claiming he wasn\\'t a \"people person\", Batman did not officially join the League, though he did offer to be on call when the League needed his help. Long considered the brains of the League, Batman often found solutions that eluded the other members. He was quick to place himself in danger, despite the awe-inspiring powers of his teammates. During the Atlantis Usurpation, Batman put a stop to the melting of the Polar Ice Caps. On another occasion, Batman single-handedly defeated five dangerous criminals before being taken prisoner by an Amazon trained criminal. During his time with the League, Batman showed his distrust of Superman. After Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid and when Batman had to pull Superman back later when he attempted to end Darkseid\\'s life, Batman began carrying a piece of Kryptonite, which was revealed when the android Amazo copied Superman\\'s powers. However, Batman still held a deep respect for the Man of Steel, especially after he had seemingly died at the hands of Toyman. But, regardless of his respect, Batman remained stubborn in his disbelief in Superman\\'s death, and refused to mourn for him for quite a while. During the Thanagarian Invasion of Earth, Batman was forced to reveal his identity to his teammates. After successfully retaking the Watchtower from Thanagarian Forces, Batman piloted the Watchtower through the Earth\\'s atmosphere in an attempt to plunge it into a Hyperspace Bypass, a city-wide machine that would generate a wormhole through the Earth. As Batman lost consciousness due to the heat surrounding him, Superman rescued him and as the Watchtower destroyed the Bypass Generator. With the Watchtower\\'s destruction and Hawkgirl \\'s resignation from the League, Batman and the five other members reformed the Justice League with a new Watchtower and an expanded roster of heroes. Batman was instrumental in recruiting Green Arrow into the League, who along with other human league members, helped keep the League from becoming an autonomous Metahuman army. With Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, Batman fought Chronos across time, an adventure during which he met another Batman as well as his older self. He also succeeded in demonstrating to Amanda Waller that Cadmus was being used as a tool to further Lex Luthor\\'s personal agenda to discredit and destroy the Justice League. Amanda Waller was so impressed with Batman that she created Project Batman Beyond to ensure that the world would always have a Batman. Joker\\'s Final Joke After these events, Robin went missing for three weeks while on patrol, with Batman and Batgirl searching for him, until they learned he was at Arkham Asylum . They encounter Joker and Harley Quinn , who reveal that they adopted a son named J.J.(Joker, Jr.), who was actually Robin brainwashed and driven insane. Joker seems to escape, with Batman hot in pursuit. However, he was actually trying to lure Batman into Arkham\\'s Cineplex, where he reveals that he subjected Robin to countless amounts of psychological and physical tortures, and because of this, Joker now knows Batman\\'s true identity, and everything about him. Batman, enraged at the cruelty and torture Joker inflicted onto Robin, smashes through the theater box, and beats Joker down (wrecking the projector in the process, causing Joker to say \"If you don\\'t like the movie, I\\'ve got slides!\"), then hurls Joker down to the room that J.J.\\'s in. Batman threatens to break Joker in half, causing the Joker to retort that he would have done it years ago if he really wanted to do it. Suddenly, The Joker draws a switchblade, and slices Batman\\'s chest, as well as stabs his leg. He then gives what looks like a gun to J.J. and tells him to kill Batman (or, in his words, \"deliver the punchline.\"). J.J. then pulls the trigger, revealing the gun to actually be the infamous \"Bang!\" flag spear gun that is one of the Joker\\'s trademark weapons. J.J. apparently hesitates to kill Batman, causing the Joker to shout \"DO IT!\". Tim reluctantly obliges. Instead of killing Batman however, he instead turns it away at the last second, thus shooting the Joker instead, killing him. J.J. half laughs and half sobs at the events, and Batgirl (having arrived after her fight with Harley Quinn) tries to console him. Commissioner Gordon and Batman later bury the body of Joker in the ruins of Arkham, and Tim is taken to Doctor Leslie Thompkins for rehabilitation. After these events, Batman forbade Tim Drake from ever becoming Robin again. Tim attempted to go solo for a few years, but in the end quit the super-hero life, got married and had children. He broke off contact with Bruce but remained close with Barbara and perhaps Dick. Also, as a result of the fight, Batman walked with a slight limp which in his later years would force him to walk with a cane. Late Adventures Many years passed following the attack of the Joker on the Bat-Family, Bruce entered middle age and began to suffer with a bad heart from the effects of a hard life of crime fighting. Batman developed a powered high tech suit (which had longer Bat ears and minus a cape) that augmented his physical abilities and allowed him to continue the never-ending battle for a few more years. At this time, his corporate rivalry with Derek Powers began, and Wayne Enterprises resisted a hostile bid for corporate takeover. However, injuries suffered through the long decades of physical punishment and an ailing heart finally took their toll, and even the suit couldn\\'t compensate any longer. While attempting to rescue his old friend Veronica Vreeland\\'s daughter Bunny Vreeland from kidnappers, Batman managed to subdue the kidnappers with limited effort until he was forced to point a gun at a common thug to save Ms. Vreeland and his own life after suffering a heart attack while in the midst of the fight. Injured, Batman limps outside the hangar, removing his mask upon realizing he was wielding a handgun, forced to rely on the weapon of his parents\\' cowardly murderer to defend himself against criminals. Ashamed, Bruce returns to the Batcave, where he places the Batsuit in the costume display gallery. Walking to the top of the stairs, Bruce takes one last look at the Batcave and solemnly vows, \"Never again.\" Vowing to never again wear the cowl, Bruce then shuts off the lights, and leaves his past in the darkness. Passing the Mantle of the Bat When he hung up the mantle of the bat, Bruce came a recluse, shut off in Wayne Manor with his dog, Ace. He withdrew from the day to day operations of Wayne Enterprises, a decision that left the company vulnerable to a takeover by Derek Powers and caused Wayne much regret. It was now the year 2039 and Bruce Wayne had become a very old man. Chance brought teen-aged Terry McGinnis to the gates of Wayne Manor, where he learned of Bruce\\'s past secret life. After McGinnis suffered the loss of his father, Bruce reluctantly agreed to allow him to take up mantle of Batman. Bruce then served as a mentor and informant for the successor to his legacy. For years, Bruce coordinated with Terry, supplying advice and direction from the Batcave while McGinnis worked in the field. He also ran the labs and developed new gadgets for Terry to use in the new crusade against crime. The elderly Bruce Wayne occasionally ventured into the field to support Terry. His sense of duty and self-sacrifice ever present, he once donned a suit of Batman armor to rescue Terry from the villain Inque, despite Inque\\'s Metahuman power and the strain produced on Bruce\\'s already damaged heart. As Bruce continued to age, he suffered a kidney failure. When it was discovered that Terry was not just a suitable donor but a perfect one, their relationship reached its weakest point; Terry, like Dick Grayson before him, felt betrayed, manipulated, and outright used. He set off to uncover the truth from someone willing to reveal it. Terry confronted Amanda Waller and learned the truth about his heritage. In her earlier years, Waller realized the world would always need a Batman. Taking fate into her own hands (unbeknownst to Bruce), she gathered a sample of Bruce Wayne\\'s genetic material, after a battle that left Batman in need of medical attention. Using her Cadmus connections, Waller implanted this genetic material into a young Warren McGinnis, replacing his genetic material with Bruce\\'s. Thus, Terry McGinnis was born, the son of Bruce Wayne, sharing half his genetic code. Terry returned to Wayne Manor with a new sense of purpose. Bruce wondered about the fate of Gotham, and Terry replied \"I\\'ve got it covered. Always.\" Their relationship repaired; Bruce had truly become the father Terry had lost long ago. The Savage Timeline In an alternate timeline created by Vandal Savage, the Axis forces won World War II. There, Bruce Wayne lost his parents when they spoke out against the regime and became Batman to fight Savage and his forces. He served as the leader of the resistance movement, recruiting other victims. Unlike his original self, Batman was willing to use guns without a second thought. When the Justice League from the original timeline arrived, Batman helped them escape from the authorities and learned of our timeline. He assisted them in breaking into the facility where the time portal was kept. However, Batman did not accompany the League into the past to thwart Savage, preferring to stay behind and lead the resistance in case they failed. It is assumed that this reality ceased to exist when the League defeated Savage and counteract the Axis powers\\' artificial advantages. Powers and Abilities Through his years of intensive physical training, the Batman represents the peak of human physical conditioning. Batman is at peak human levels of strength, stamina, agility, coordination, reflexes, speed, and durability. Even well into old age, Bruce Wayne still demonstrated that he could manhandle other much younger men with ease. Batman\\'s martial arts discipline was never mentioned, in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Bruce Wayne mentions Ju Jitsu. Batman was also a master of stealth and infiltration (all the more remarkable given that he stands 6\\'2\" and weighs 215 lbs), and often revealed himself to his enemies when they least suspected him to. This also allowed him to just disappear from allies in mid-sentence, a habit that frequently annoyed the likes of Commissioner Gordon (\"one of these days I\\'m gonna nail his feet to the ground\") and Harvey Bullock (\"I wonder how the Commish puts up with that\"). Batman was capable of incredible feats of agility. During the Second Apokolyptian invasion, Darkseid commented with much surprise that Batman had been the first one to dodge his Omega Beams. With his martial arts prowess, occasionally augmented by technology, Batman was usually more than a match for any foe he encountered, human or otherwise. Equipment As the head of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce Wayne has access to cutting edge technology and Batman makes good use of it in his field equipment. Batsuit-standard as well as heat-resistant, cold-resistant, and underwater versions. Batarangs-of differing size and effect. These ranged from standard, to explosive, electric, remote, etc. Grapple-gun. This item assisted Batman in scaling the various buildings of Gotham City. Utility Belt - Batman\\'s Utility Belt has compartments to hold several items, the contents of which change according to his needs, and often include items such as flashlights, laser cutters, underwater rebreathers, binoculars, a fingerprinting kit, flashbangs, remote controls for his vehicles, acid/base compounds, anti-toxins, mini-computer, and smoke pellets. Vehicles Batman has used several vehicles in the course of his crimefighting career, including: Batmobile Batwing Batcycle Batboat Appearances Batman: The Animated Series Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero The New Batman Adventures Superman: The Animated Series Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Batman Beyond Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Justice League Justice League Unlimited Static Shock', 'Batman General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bob Kane Bill Finger Affiliations: Batman Family Justice Society of America Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Martial arts master Access to high tech equipment Batman was the sworn protector of Gotham City on Earth-Two. Contents 1 History 1.1 DCnU 2 Behind the scenes 3 In other media 4 See Also History Although as a young boy Bruce Wayne lost his parents to a gun-wielding robber , as his vigilante alter-ego Batman, he took firearms into his war on crime. The Batman of Earth-Two did not have the same \"no-guns\" policy as his Earth-One counterpart. He often wore a holster on his utility belt that carried his pistol and had a machine gun mounted on the Batplane. Batman had to rescue his girlfriend Julie Madison from the vampires The Monk and Dala . When he found them resting in their coffins he shot them both dead with silver bullets. After tracking down Dr. Hugo Strange and his mutated men, Batman opened fire on the disfigured humans from the Batplane . On several other occasions, the gun on his utility belt was clearly visible. Considered a vigilante by the police because he killed many of his early opponents, Wayne as Batman proved to be effective against the open acting crime organizations that the ineffective Gotham City police force could not. Batman began gathering the grudging admiration of then Police Commissioner James Gordon in his efforts, despite Batman\\'s lethal methods of crime combating operations. The Caped Crusader joined the Justice Society of America to unite heroes against the threat of Nazi Germany during World War II. Batman later married his former foe Catwoman and became the father of Huntress (Helena Wayne) . DCnU Bruce Wayne was a man of many options, suited for almost any task he was forced to make hard decisions during the end of the world. Prior to the Apokolips War Bruce Wayne fought crime as Batman and eventually fell in love with former villain Selina Kyle who went by the alias Catwoman. The two got married and eventually had a daughter that they named Helena Wayne . Bruce originally did not want his daughter to become involved in his hero life believing it would endanger her, but ended up letting her be Robin after Selina died and when the Apokolips War began. When Steppenwolf brought the Parademons to Metropolis and across the world with boom tubes he wasted no time destroying Gotham City as well. On his last day, Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman devised a plan to destroy the remaining towers erected by Steppenwolf. Batman died after giving his last words to his daughter as the virus he planted caused the tower he was in to explode. Behind the scenes Batman in earlier comics also frequently killed villains and thugs by punching or kicking them into vats of acid, or off roofs. In other media In Batman , Bruce Wayne was similar to the gun-toting Batman of Earth-Two. He opened fire on the Joker with the Batwing . Presumably an attempt to shoot Joker with the Batwing\\'s guns and rockets, but missed hitting a few Goons . Over the course of the film series, he killed a handful of other minor character amidst collateral damage or fighting at the top of the cathedral. Notable exceptions in the sequels included the brutal executions of the circus strongman and Two-Face . In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice , Batman is even more casually murderous, using vehicular mounted weaponry. See Also Batman (Earth-2)/Gallery Batman Batman (Disambiguation)'],\n",
      "    response='Based on the information from the DC Comics lore, particularly from \"The Batman\" series referenced in our context, Bruce Wayne was approximately 23 years old when he first became Batman. This is derived from details indicating he was 26 and in his third year of being Batman during the first season of that adaptation.\\n\\nTo give you a bit more context and make this useful for your interests, Batman\\'s origin story can vary slightly across different comics, TV shows, and movies. For instance, in the classic comics, Bruce often begins his crusade in his late teens or early 20s after his parents\\' murder, but exact ages aren\\'t always specified. If you\\'re exploring this for trivia or fan discussions, keep in mind that factors like his training and vow as a child shape this timeline.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like, I can expand on related topics—such as how his age impacts his character development, differences in other Batman adaptations, or recommendations for comics that dive deeper into his early years—just let me know!'\n",

In the DC universe, Batman—whose real name is Bruce Wayne—is portrayed as a highly skilled human vigilante without any innate superhuman abilities. Instead, he relies on his exceptional training, intelligence, and technology to fight crime. For example, he achieves feats that might seem superhuman through peak physical condition (like expert martial arts and acrobatics), genius-level detective skills, and advanced gadgets from his utility belt, such as batarangs or smoke pellets.\\n\\nThis makes Batman unique compared to characters like Spider-Man, as his effectiveness comes from preparation, strategy, and human determination rather than biological enhancements.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced.

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History.

He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber.

He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition.

Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate . His primary form of combat is a harmonious mixture of Jui-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Judo, Muay Thai, Savate, Karate, Kung Fu, Boxing, Capoeira, Krav Maga, Aikido, and Ninjutsu. Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21. He has mastered Diverse Environmental Training, Security Systems, and illusion/sleight of hand by the time he was 23. He gained even more degrees in Biology, Physics, Advanced Chemistry, and Technology by the time he was 25. He has learned Forensic, Medical Sciences, Expanded Computer and Engineering Sciences, and Expanded Device Pool use of personal powered armor and system, database creation on underworld crime bosses, rogue\\'s gallery foes and other supers; improved material sciences for body armor and micro-machinery by the time he was 26. Has also learned Advanced New Development in Forensic and Medical Sciences. Master Tactician : He is a master strategist and tactician commonly utilizes extremely cunning tactics, strategies, and protocols to outwit his foes. He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture. Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang.

His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen.

He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23.

He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone.

His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21.

He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture.

Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

The two operated as superheroes under the aliases of Gotham and Gotham Girl . After Hank\\'s death, Claire joined the Batman family, though she fell under the influence of the Psycho Pirate and Bane . Contents 1 Biography 1.1 Debut in Gotham 1.2 Under Psycho Pirate\\'s Control 2 Powers and Abilities Biography Like her brother, Claire Clover was a fan of Batman, after her family were saved from a mugging by the vigilante. Hoping to help him in return for his deeds, the two bought experimental treatment that granted them similar powers to Superman . However, whilst using them, they would draw off their life span, meaning they could only live for two years with similar powers as the man of steel or an hour with the powers of a god. After undergoing the therapy, they began operating as superheroes under the aliases of \"Gotham\" and \"Gotham Girl\". Debut in Gotham Claire first met Batman when she and Hank, as their superhero identities, saved both him and a plane from crashing into the Gotham bay. Taken under the wing by the Dark Knight, they assisted him in a battle with Solomon Grundy , and the investigation of the confession and suicide of a man in the commissioner\\'s office. After a month of operating and assisting in saving civilians off a falling bridge, they were drawn to an explosion within the city and were confronted by Professor Strange and Psycho Pirate . Manipulating their feelings, Pirate made the two afraid, causing Hank to kill twenty-three of the criminals\\' followers and Claire to be paralyzed with fear. The surviving member would later kill their parents after discovering their identities. Taken to the Batcave to recuperate and inspired by a conversation between her and Duke Thomas , Claire would join Batman and the entire Justice League to battle an insane Hank, during which he died from overusing his powers. The following week, Claire suffered a similar effect to her brother, talking herself as if she was conversing with him whilst continuing to operate as Gotham Girl. During this time, she battled some of Batman\\'s lesser known enemies like Colonel Blimp , Captain Stingaree and Kite Man . Confronting her on a rooftop, Batman revealed his identity to her and offered her help dealing with the trauma. Claire accepted, breaking down in the vigilante\\'s arms as she admitted how much she missed her brother. After the encounter, she helped Batman capture Strange and defeat his Monster Men . Under Psycho Pirate\\'s Control Hoping to help restore her condition, Batman organized an assault on Peña Duro to take Psycho Pirate and restore her sanity. However, Psycho Pirate manipulated her into joining Bane , the two planning to use her in the latter\\'s schemes. Aiming to destroy Batman on a personal level, they used the Medusa Mask\\'s powers to push her to Bane\\'s side, using them to manipulate Batman into proposing to Catwoman . When Bane took over Gotham City, Gotham Girl was taken in by the Flashpoint Batman as his \"Robin\". Under his influence, she helped bring the city under the control of the supervillains and used as a deterrent for other superheroes, proving her potential by defeating Captain Atom . Batman was eventually able to defeat both villains and restore Claire to her regular state. Some time after the battle\\'s end, Claire was exposed to Platinum Kryptonite , which restored her lost lifespan. Powers and Abilities Ultra Powers : Claire has \"ultra\" powers which let her tap into a vast array of abilities (typically resembling those of Superman ) albeit with a great cost. The more of her powers she used, the more it drained her physical lifespan. Among these powers were flight, super-strength, superhuman stamina, invulnerability and endurance, and Ultra-Vision. Batman eventually negated Claire\\'s condition by exposing her to Platinum Kryptonite , restoring her lifespan and giving her the powers permanently.', 'Batman General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne Aliases: Batman The Batman The Dark Knight The World\\'s Greatest Detective The Caped Crusader Portrayed by: Kevin Conroy (voice) Appearances: Batman: The Animated Series Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero The Batman/Superman Movie Batman Beyond Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Static Shock Justice League Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Justice League Unlimited Batman is a costumed crimefighter who is actually billionaire Bruce Wayne by day.

His personal favourite was the Gray Ghost , watching the television show with his father. On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to Wonder Woman , Bruce hadn\\'t been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes\\' faithful friend and butler, Alfred Pennyworth Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from Yoru Sensei . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor\\'s daughter Zatanna became very close. As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with Andrea Beaumont . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\". War on Crime Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the Batcave . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city\\'s underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in Dick Grayson as his ward after witnessing his parents\\' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down their murderer . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and Commissioner James Gordon , working with them to control crime in Gotham. Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included the Penguin , Poison Ivy , Mr. Freeze and the Scarecrow . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including Catwoman and Two-Face . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered the Joker , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created. New Adventures Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as Batwoman . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called Batgirl began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father\\'s legacy as the next Police Commissioner. Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned Tim Drake from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder. Joining Up For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called Blüdhaven . Batman would later find himself in Metropolis , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with Lex Luthor , Batman would find himself working with Superman to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker\\'s plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue\\'s gallery. He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another\\'s home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity. Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper. It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world\\'s greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League. Saving the World Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech\\'s deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station\\'s antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J\\'onn J\\'onzz\\' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna\\'s destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch. Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman\\'s mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don\\'t even think about it\". When the Imperium\\'s attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation. Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J\\'onn J\\'onzz. After freeing J\\'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J\\'onn J\\'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of Wonder Woman . The Flash arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing\\'s severed wing. After J\\'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium\\'s invasion of Mars , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium\\'s factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun\\'s rays. The heroes split up to disable the factories. Batman went to Giza, Egypt with Wonder Woman and J\\'onn J\\'onzz. The trio infiltrated the factory and found the Ion Matrix Crystal, a vital component of the plant. Batman and Wonder Woman provided a diversion to allow J\\'onzz to remove the crystal. As he removed the crystal, J\\'onzz was incapacitated by Imperium forces. Batman then covered Wonder Woman and J\\'onzz\\' escape from the plant, but was himself trapped inside and cornered by Imperium forces. J\\'onzz reported that Batman was dead, but in truth, he had mentally shielded Batman to prevent the Imperium forces from detecting him. Batman remained hidden until the Imperium arrived on Earth. He then revealed himself and reversed the ion charge in the Ion Matrix Crystal, causing the plant to burn off the smoke it had been producing. With the sun shining again, the heroes defeated the Imperium and freed their human prisoners, then mopped up the remaining Imperium forces around the globe. Inspired by a general\\'s speech about vigilance and the possible return of the invaders, Batman had the Watchtower constructed by Wayne Enterprises, hiding the funding as a \"line item in the aerospace R&D budget\". Batman invited the other six heroes who had repelled the invaders to the station. The seven heroes formed the Justice League. Claiming he wasn\\'t a \"people person\", Batman did not officially join the League, though he did offer to be on call when the League needed his help. Long considered the brains of the League, Batman often found solutions that eluded the other members. He was quick to place himself in danger, despite the awe-inspiring powers of his teammates. During the Atlantis Usurpation, Batman put a stop to the melting of the Polar Ice Caps. On another occasion, Batman single-handedly defeated five dangerous criminals before being taken prisoner by an Amazon trained criminal. During his time with the League, Batman showed his distrust of Superman. After Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid and when Batman had to pull Superman back later when he attempted to end Darkseid\\'s life, Batman began carrying a piece of Kryptonite, which was revealed when the android Amazo copied Superman\\'s powers. However, Batman still held a deep respect for the Man of Steel, especially after he had seemingly died at the hands of Toyman. But, regardless of his respect, Batman remained stubborn in his disbelief in Superman\\'s death, and refused to mourn for him for quite a while. During the Thanagarian Invasion of Earth, Batman was forced to reveal his identity to his teammates. After successfully retaking the Watchtower from Thanagarian Forces, Batman piloted the Watchtower through the Earth\\'s atmosphere in an attempt to plunge it into a Hyperspace Bypass, a city-wide machine that would generate a wormhole through the Earth. As Batman lost consciousness due to the heat surrounding him, Superman rescued him and as the Watchtower destroyed the Bypass Generator. With the Watchtower\\'s destruction and Hawkgirl \\'s resignation from the League, Batman and the five other members reformed the Justice League with a new Watchtower and an expanded roster of heroes. Batman was instrumental in recruiting Green Arrow into the League, who along with other human league members, helped keep the League from becoming an autonomous Metahuman army. With Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, Batman fought Chronos across time, an adventure during which he met another Batman as well as his older self. He also succeeded in demonstrating to Amanda Waller that Cadmus was being used as a tool to further Lex Luthor\\'s personal agenda to discredit and destroy the Justice League. Amanda Waller was so impressed with Batman that she created Project Batman Beyond to ensure that the world would always have a Batman. Joker\\'s Final Joke After these events, Robin went missing for three weeks while on patrol, with Batman and Batgirl searching for him, until they learned he was at Arkham Asylum . They encounter Joker and Harley Quinn , who reveal that they adopted a son named J.J.(Joker, Jr.), who was actually Robin brainwashed and driven insane. Joker seems to escape, with Batman hot in pursuit. However, he was actually trying to lure Batman into Arkham\\'s Cineplex, where he reveals that he subjected Robin to countless amounts of psychological and physical tortures, and because of this, Joker now knows Batman\\'s true identity, and everything about him. Batman, enraged at the cruelty and torture Joker inflicted onto Robin, smashes through the theater box, and beats Joker down (wrecking the projector in the process, causing Joker to say \"If you don\\'t like the movie, I\\'ve got slides!\"), then hurls Joker down to the room that J.J.\\'s in. Batman threatens to break Joker in half, causing the Joker to retort that he would have done it years ago if he really wanted to do it. Suddenly, The Joker draws a switchblade, and slices Batman\\'s chest, as well as stabs his leg. He then gives what looks like a gun to J.J. and tells him to kill Batman (or, in his words, \"deliver the punchline.\"). J.J. then pulls the trigger, revealing the gun to actually be the infamous \"Bang!\" flag spear gun that is one of the Joker\\'s trademark weapons. J.J. apparently hesitates to kill Batman, causing the Joker to shout \"DO IT!\". Tim reluctantly obliges. Instead of killing Batman however, he instead turns it away at the last second, thus shooting the Joker instead, killing him. J.J. half laughs and half sobs at the events, and Batgirl (having arrived after her fight with Harley Quinn) tries to console him. Commissioner Gordon and Batman later bury the body of Joker in the ruins of Arkham, and Tim is taken to Doctor Leslie Thompkins for rehabilitation. After these events, Batman forbade Tim Drake from ever becoming Robin again. Tim attempted to go solo for a few years, but in the end quit the super-hero life, got married and had children. He broke off contact with Bruce but remained close with Barbara and perhaps Dick. Also, as a result of the fight, Batman walked with a slight limp which in his later years would force him to walk with a cane. Late Adventures Many years passed following the attack of the Joker on the Bat-Family, Bruce entered middle age and began to suffer with a bad heart from the effects of a hard life of crime fighting. Batman developed a powered high tech suit (which had longer Bat ears and minus a cape) that augmented his physical abilities and allowed him to continue the never-ending battle for a few more years. At this time, his corporate rivalry with Derek Powers began, and Wayne Enterprises resisted a hostile bid for corporate takeover. However, injuries suffered through the long decades of physical punishment and an ailing heart finally took their toll, and even the suit couldn\\'t compensate any longer. While attempting to rescue his old friend Veronica Vreeland\\'s daughter Bunny Vreeland from kidnappers, Batman managed to subdue the kidnappers with limited effort until he was forced to point a gun at a common thug to save Ms. Vreeland and his own life after suffering a heart attack while in the midst of the fight. Injured, Batman limps outside the hangar, removing his mask upon realizing he was wielding a handgun, forced to rely on the weapon of his parents\\' cowardly murderer to defend himself against criminals. Ashamed, Bruce returns to the Batcave, where he places the Batsuit in the costume display gallery. Walking to the top of the stairs, Bruce takes one last look at the Batcave and solemnly vows, \"Never again.\" Vowing to never again wear the cowl, Bruce then shuts off the lights, and leaves his past in the darkness. Passing the Mantle of the Bat When he hung up the mantle of the bat, Bruce came a recluse, shut off in Wayne Manor with his dog, Ace. He withdrew from the day to day operations of Wayne Enterprises, a decision that left the company vulnerable to a takeover by Derek Powers and caused Wayne much regret. It was now the year 2039 and Bruce Wayne had become a very old man. Chance brought teen-aged Terry McGinnis to the gates of Wayne Manor, where he learned of Bruce\\'s past secret life. After McGinnis suffered the loss of his father, Bruce reluctantly agreed to allow him to take up mantle of Batman. Bruce then served as a mentor and informant for the successor to his legacy. For years, Bruce coordinated with Terry, supplying advice and direction from the Batcave while McGinnis worked in the field. He also ran the labs and developed new gadgets for Terry to use in the new crusade against crime. The elderly Bruce Wayne occasionally ventured into the field to support Terry. His sense of duty and self-sacrifice ever present, he once donned a suit of Batman armor to rescue Terry from the villain Inque, despite Inque\\'s Metahuman power and the strain produced on Bruce\\'s already damaged heart. As Bruce continued to age, he suffered a kidney failure. When it was discovered that Terry was not just a suitable donor but a perfect one, their relationship reached its weakest point; Terry, like Dick Grayson before him, felt betrayed, manipulated, and outright used. He set off to uncover the truth from someone willing to reveal it. Terry confronted Amanda Waller and learned the truth about his heritage. In her earlier years, Waller realized the world would always need a Batman. Taking fate into her own hands (unbeknownst to Bruce), she gathered a sample of Bruce Wayne\\'s genetic material, after a battle that left Batman in need of medical attention. Using her Cadmus connections, Waller implanted this genetic material into a young Warren McGinnis, replacing his genetic material with Bruce\\'s. Thus, Terry McGinnis was born, the son of Bruce Wayne, sharing half his genetic code. Terry returned to Wayne Manor with a new sense of purpose. Bruce wondered about the fate of Gotham, and Terry replied \"I\\'ve got it covered. Always.\" Their relationship repaired; Bruce had truly become the father Terry had lost long ago. The Savage Timeline In an alternate timeline created by Vandal Savage, the Axis forces won World War II. There, Bruce Wayne lost his parents when they spoke out against the regime and became Batman to fight Savage and his forces. He served as the leader of the resistance movement, recruiting other victims. Unlike his original self, Batman was willing to use guns without a second thought. When the Justice League from the original timeline arrived, Batman helped them escape from the authorities and learned of our timeline. He assisted them in breaking into the facility where the time portal was kept. However, Batman did not accompany the League into the past to thwart Savage, preferring to stay behind and lead the resistance in case they failed. It is assumed that this reality ceased to exist when the League defeated Savage and counteract the Axis powers\\' artificial advantages. Powers and Abilities Through his years of intensive physical training, the Batman represents the peak of human physical conditioning. Batman is at peak human levels of strength, stamina, agility, coordination, reflexes, speed, and durability. Even well into old age, Bruce Wayne still demonstrated that he could manhandle other much younger men with ease. Batman\\'s martial arts discipline was never mentioned, in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Bruce Wayne mentions Ju Jitsu. Batman was also a master of stealth and infiltration (all the more remarkable given that he stands 6\\'2\" and weighs 215 lbs), and often revealed himself to his enemies when they least suspected him to. This also allowed him to just disappear from allies in mid-sentence, a habit that frequently annoyed the likes of Commissioner Gordon (\"one of these days I\\'m gonna nail his feet to the ground\") and Harvey Bullock (\"I wonder how the Commish puts up with that\"). Batman was capable of incredible feats of agility. During the Second Apokolyptian invasion, Darkseid commented with much surprise that Batman had been the first one to dodge his Omega Beams. With his martial arts prowess, occasionally augmented by technology, Batman was usually more than a match for any foe he encountered, human or otherwise. Equipment As the head of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce Wayne has access to cutting edge technology and Batman makes good use of it in his field equipment. Batsuit-standard as well as heat-resistant, cold-resistant, and underwater versions. Batarangs-of differing size and effect. These ranged from standard, to explosive, electric, remote, etc. Grapple-gun. This item assisted Batman in scaling the various buildings of Gotham City. Utility Belt - Batman\\'s Utility Belt has compartments to hold several items, the contents of which change according to his needs, and often include items such as flashlights, laser cutters, underwater rebreathers, binoculars, a fingerprinting kit, flashbangs, remote controls for his vehicles, acid/base compounds, anti-toxins, mini-computer, and smoke pellets. Vehicles Batman has used several vehicles in the course of his crimefighting career, including: Batmobile Batwing Batcycle Batboat Appearances Batman: The Animated Series Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero The New Batman Adventures Superman: The Animated Series Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Batman Beyond Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Justice League Justice League Unlimited Static Shock'],\n",
      "    response='No, Batman does not have superpowers like invisibility or the ability to shoot webs from his hands. In the DC universe, Batman—whose real name is Bruce Wayne—is portrayed as a highly skilled human vigilante without any innate superhuman abilities. Instead, he relies on his exceptional training, intelligence, and technology to fight crime. For example, he achieves feats that might seem superhuman through peak physical condition (like expert martial arts and acrobatics), genius-level detective skills, and advanced gadgets from his utility belt, such as batarangs or smoke pellets.\\n\\nThis makes Batman unique compared to characters like Spider-Man, as his effectiveness comes from preparation, strategy, and human determination rather than biological enhancements. If you\\'re wondering how he pulls off incredible escapes or stealth, it\\'s all about his mastery of escapology, stealth techniques, and high-tech equipment—he\\'s often called the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" for a reason!\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to know more about his training, specific gadgets, or how he stacks up against other heroes, or even examples from his stories, just let me know—I\\'m here to help dive deeper!'\n",

The student's goal is to deepen knowledge of superhero lore, so I'll focus on key adversaries and their relationships to make the answer educational and engaging.

      "    cooperative_answer=\"Batman's biggest enemies are a rogues gallery of iconic villains from the DC Comics universe, each bringing their own unique threats and motivations that challenge his sense of justice. At the top of the list is his arch-nemesis, the Joker, a chaotic clown who embodies anarchy and has pushed Batman to his limits in countless stories with his unpredictable schemes and psychological warfare. Other major foes include Catwoman, a cunning anti-heroine with a complex romantic history with Batman; the Penguin, a crime lord with a penchant for elaborate gadgets and underworld dealings; Two-Face, once Bruce Wayne's friend Harvey Dent, whose split personality drives him to obsessive duality; Bane, a physically dominant brute who once broke Batman both mentally and physically; and Poison Ivy, an eco-terrorist with plant-based powers and a radical environmental agenda. These enemies not only represent different aspects of crime and villainy but also highlight Batman's internal conflicts, like his no-kill rule and moral boundaries. If you're diving into superhero lore, it's fascinating how these characters' backstories often tie into Batman's own history— for example, the Joker might stem from themes of madness, while Bane challenges Batman's physical prowess.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill.

Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies.

For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer.

Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang.

He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23.

For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer.

Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition.

This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker.

The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers .

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps .

Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush .

Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill.

Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies.

The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons.

Batcycle Bat-Glider', 'The Batman General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne Aliases: The Batman The Dark Knight Portrayed by: Rino Romano Appearances: The Batman The Batman Strikes! The Batman vs. Dracula The Batman is a masked vigilante and the hero of Gotham City . Batman is the secret identity of billionaire Bruce Wayne , the CEO of Wayne Enterprises, who, after witnessing the death of his parents, vowed to spend the rest of his life warring on all criminals. He is a founding member of the Justice League . Contents 1 History 2 Appearance 3 Powers and Abilities 4 Paraphernalia 4.1 Equipment 4.2 Transportation 4.3 Weapons 4.4 Batsuits 5 Appearances 6 Trivia 7 Voiced by History Bruce Wayne was born a child of wealth and privilege to Thomas and Martha Wayne of Gotham City. As the Waynes\\' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father\\'s business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler, Alfred Pennyworth , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents\\' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City. As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named Ethan Bennett . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\". As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents\\' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot. For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman\\'s activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police Angel Rojas took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named Ellen Yin , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham. In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date – the Joker . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes. The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham\\'s underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named Bane . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of the Penguin , Man-Bat , Killer Croc , Cluemaster and Catwoman . One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce\\'s career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface. Some time later, a new character entered the Batman\\'s life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally. Barbara Gordon , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordan , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend Poison Ivy from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara\\'s aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt. The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist Dick Grayson was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named Tony Zucco . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick\\'s acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force. Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself John Jones . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called the Joining . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth\\'s atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John\\'s behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as Lex Luthor . At some point later, in the year 2027, Mr. Freeze had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named Nightwing . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever. One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave\\'s titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman\\'s legacy survived into the future.

His personal favourite was the Gray Ghost , watching the television show with his father. On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to Wonder Woman , Bruce hadn\\'t been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes\\' faithful friend and butler, Alfred Pennyworth Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from Yoru Sensei . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor\\'s daughter Zatanna became very close. As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with Andrea Beaumont . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\". War on Crime Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the Batcave . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city\\'s underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in Dick Grayson as his ward after witnessing his parents\\' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down their murderer . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and Commissioner James Gordon , working with them to control crime in Gotham. Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included the Penguin , Poison Ivy , Mr. Freeze and the Scarecrow . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including Catwoman and Two-Face . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered the Joker , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created. New Adventures Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as Batwoman . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called Batgirl began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father\\'s legacy as the next Police Commissioner. Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned Tim Drake from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder. Joining Up For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called Blüdhaven . Batman would later find himself in Metropolis , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with Lex Luthor , Batman would find himself working with Superman to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker\\'s plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue\\'s gallery. He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another\\'s home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity. Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper. It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world\\'s greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League. Saving the World Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech\\'s deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station\\'s antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J\\'onn J\\'onzz\\' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna\\'s destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch. Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman\\'s mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don\\'t even think about it\". When the Imperium\\'s attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation. Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J\\'onn J\\'onzz. After freeing J\\'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J\\'onn J\\'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of Wonder Woman . The Flash arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing\\'s severed wing. After J\\'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium\\'s invasion of Mars , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium\\'s factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun\\'s rays. The heroes split up to disable the factories. Batman went to Giza, Egypt with Wonder Woman and J\\'onn J\\'onzz. The trio infiltrated the factory and found the Ion Matrix Crystal, a vital component of the plant. Batman and Wonder Woman provided a diversion to allow J\\'onzz to remove the crystal. As he removed the crystal, J\\'onzz was incapacitated by Imperium forces. Batman then covered Wonder Woman and J\\'onzz\\' escape from the plant, but was himself trapped inside and cornered by Imperium forces. J\\'onzz reported that Batman was dead, but in truth, he had mentally shielded Batman to prevent the Imperium forces from detecting him. Batman remained hidden until the Imperium arrived on Earth. He then revealed himself and reversed the ion charge in the Ion Matrix Crystal, causing the plant to burn off the smoke it had been producing. With the sun shining again, the heroes defeated the Imperium and freed their human prisoners, then mopped up the remaining Imperium forces around the globe. Inspired by a general\\'s speech about vigilance and the possible return of the invaders, Batman had the Watchtower constructed by Wayne Enterprises, hiding the funding as a \"line item in the aerospace R&D budget\". Batman invited the other six heroes who had repelled the invaders to the station. The seven heroes formed the Justice League. Claiming he wasn\\'t a \"people person\", Batman did not officially join the League, though he did offer to be on call when the League needed his help. Long considered the brains of the League, Batman often found solutions that eluded the other members. He was quick to place himself in danger, despite the awe-inspiring powers of his teammates. During the Atlantis Usurpation, Batman put a stop to the melting of the Polar Ice Caps. On another occasion, Batman single-handedly defeated five dangerous criminals before being taken prisoner by an Amazon trained criminal. During his time with the League, Batman showed his distrust of Superman. After Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid and when Batman had to pull Superman back later when he attempted to end Darkseid\\'s life, Batman began carrying a piece of Kryptonite, which was revealed when the android Amazo copied Superman\\'s powers. However, Batman still held a deep respect for the Man of Steel, especially after he had seemingly died at the hands of Toyman. But, regardless of his respect, Batman remained stubborn in his disbelief in Superman\\'s death, and refused to mourn for him for quite a while. During the Thanagarian Invasion of Earth, Batman was forced to reveal his identity to his teammates. After successfully retaking the Watchtower from Thanagarian Forces, Batman piloted the Watchtower through the Earth\\'s atmosphere in an attempt to plunge it into a Hyperspace Bypass, a city-wide machine that would generate a wormhole through the Earth. As Batman lost consciousness due to the heat surrounding him, Superman rescued him and as the Watchtower destroyed the Bypass Generator. With the Watchtower\\'s destruction and Hawkgirl \\'s resignation from the League, Batman and the five other members reformed the Justice League with a new Watchtower and an expanded roster of heroes. Batman was instrumental in recruiting Green Arrow into the League, who along with other human league members, helped keep the League from becoming an autonomous Metahuman army. With Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, Batman fought Chronos across time, an adventure during which he met another Batman as well as his older self. He also succeeded in demonstrating to Amanda Waller that Cadmus was being used as a tool to further Lex Luthor\\'s personal agenda to discredit and destroy the Justice League. Amanda Waller was so impressed with Batman that she created Project Batman Beyond to ensure that the world would always have a Batman. Joker\\'s Final Joke After these events, Robin went missing for three weeks while on patrol, with Batman and Batgirl searching for him, until they learned he was at Arkham Asylum . They encounter Joker and Harley Quinn , who reveal that they adopted a son named J.J.(Joker, Jr.), who was actually Robin brainwashed and driven insane. Joker seems to escape, with Batman hot in pursuit. However, he was actually trying to lure Batman into Arkham\\'s Cineplex, where he reveals that he subjected Robin to countless amounts of psychological and physical tortures, and because of this, Joker now knows Batman\\'s true identity, and everything about him. Batman, enraged at the cruelty and torture Joker inflicted onto Robin, smashes through the theater box, and beats Joker down (wrecking the projector in the process, causing Joker to say \"If you don\\'t like the movie, I\\'ve got slides!\"), then hurls Joker down to the room that J.J.\\'s in. Batman threatens to break Joker in half, causing the Joker to retort that he would have done it years ago if he really wanted to do it. Suddenly, The Joker draws a switchblade, and slices Batman\\'s chest, as well as stabs his leg. He then gives what looks like a gun to J.J. and tells him to kill Batman (or, in his words, \"deliver the punchline.\"). J.J. then pulls the trigger, revealing the gun to actually be the infamous \"Bang!\" flag spear gun that is one of the Joker\\'s trademark weapons. J.J. apparently hesitates to kill Batman, causing the Joker to shout \"DO IT!\". Tim reluctantly obliges. Instead of killing Batman however, he instead turns it away at the last second, thus shooting the Joker instead, killing him. J.J. half laughs and half sobs at the events, and Batgirl (having arrived after her fight with Harley Quinn) tries to console him. Commissioner Gordon and Batman later bury the body of Joker in the ruins of Arkham, and Tim is taken to Doctor Leslie Thompkins for rehabilitation. After these events, Batman forbade Tim Drake from ever becoming Robin again. Tim attempted to go solo for a few years, but in the end quit the super-hero life, got married and had children. He broke off contact with Bruce but remained close with Barbara and perhaps Dick. Also, as a result of the fight, Batman walked with a slight limp which in his later years would force him to walk with a cane. Late Adventures Many years passed following the attack of the Joker on the Bat-Family, Bruce entered middle age and began to suffer with a bad heart from the effects of a hard life of crime fighting. Batman developed a powered high tech suit (which had longer Bat ears and minus a cape) that augmented his physical abilities and allowed him to continue the never-ending battle for a few more years. At this time, his corporate rivalry with Derek Powers began, and Wayne Enterprises resisted a hostile bid for corporate takeover. However, injuries suffered through the long decades of physical punishment and an ailing heart finally took their toll, and even the suit couldn\\'t compensate any longer. While attempting to rescue his old friend Veronica Vreeland\\'s daughter Bunny Vreeland from kidnappers, Batman managed to subdue the kidnappers with limited effort until he was forced to point a gun at a common thug to save Ms. Vreeland and his own life after suffering a heart attack while in the midst of the fight. Injured, Batman limps outside the hangar, removing his mask upon realizing he was wielding a handgun, forced to rely on the weapon of his parents\\' cowardly murderer to defend himself against criminals. Ashamed, Bruce returns to the Batcave, where he places the Batsuit in the costume display gallery. Walking to the top of the stairs, Bruce takes one last look at the Batcave and solemnly vows, \"Never again.\" Vowing to never again wear the cowl, Bruce then shuts off the lights, and leaves his past in the darkness. Passing the Mantle of the Bat When he hung up the mantle of the bat, Bruce came a recluse, shut off in Wayne Manor with his dog, Ace. He withdrew from the day to day operations of Wayne Enterprises, a decision that left the company vulnerable to a takeover by Derek Powers and caused Wayne much regret. It was now the year 2039 and Bruce Wayne had become a very old man. Chance brought teen-aged Terry McGinnis to the gates of Wayne Manor, where he learned of Bruce\\'s past secret life. After McGinnis suffered the loss of his father, Bruce reluctantly agreed to allow him to take up mantle of Batman. Bruce then served as a mentor and informant for the successor to his legacy. For years, Bruce coordinated with Terry, supplying advice and direction from the Batcave while McGinnis worked in the field. He also ran the labs and developed new gadgets for Terry to use in the new crusade against crime. The elderly Bruce Wayne occasionally ventured into the field to support Terry. His sense of duty and self-sacrifice ever present, he once donned a suit of Batman armor to rescue Terry from the villain Inque, despite Inque\\'s Metahuman power and the strain produced on Bruce\\'s already damaged heart. As Bruce continued to age, he suffered a kidney failure. When it was discovered that Terry was not just a suitable donor but a perfect one, their relationship reached its weakest point; Terry, like Dick Grayson before him, felt betrayed, manipulated, and outright used. He set off to uncover the truth from someone willing to reveal it. Terry confronted Amanda Waller and learned the truth about his heritage. In her earlier years, Waller realized the world would always need a Batman. Taking fate into her own hands (unbeknownst to Bruce), she gathered a sample of Bruce Wayne\\'s genetic material, after a battle that left Batman in need of medical attention. Using her Cadmus connections, Waller implanted this genetic material into a young Warren McGinnis, replacing his genetic material with Bruce\\'s. Thus, Terry McGinnis was born, the son of Bruce Wayne, sharing half his genetic code. Terry returned to Wayne Manor with a new sense of purpose. Bruce wondered about the fate of Gotham, and Terry replied \"I\\'ve got it covered. Always.\" Their relationship repaired; Bruce had truly become the father Terry had lost long ago. The Savage Timeline In an alternate timeline created by Vandal Savage, the Axis forces won World War II. There, Bruce Wayne lost his parents when they spoke out against the regime and became Batman to fight Savage and his forces. He served as the leader of the resistance movement, recruiting other victims. Unlike his original self, Batman was willing to use guns without a second thought. When the Justice League from the original timeline arrived, Batman helped them escape from the authorities and learned of our timeline. He assisted them in breaking into the facility where the time portal was kept. However, Batman did not accompany the League into the past to thwart Savage, preferring to stay behind and lead the resistance in case they failed. It is assumed that this reality ceased to exist when the League defeated Savage and counteract the Axis powers\\' artificial advantages. Powers and Abilities Through his years of intensive physical training, the Batman represents the peak of human physical conditioning. Batman is at peak human levels of strength, stamina, agility, coordination, reflexes, speed, and durability. Even well into old age, Bruce Wayne still demonstrated that he could manhandle other much younger men with ease. Batman\\'s martial arts discipline was never mentioned, in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Bruce Wayne mentions Ju Jitsu. Batman was also a master of stealth and infiltration (all the more remarkable given that he stands 6\\'2\" and weighs 215 lbs), and often revealed himself to his enemies when they least suspected him to. This also allowed him to just disappear from allies in mid-sentence, a habit that frequently annoyed the likes of Commissioner Gordon (\"one of these days I\\'m gonna nail his feet to the ground\") and Harvey Bullock (\"I wonder how the Commish puts up with that\"). Batman was capable of incredible feats of agility. During the Second Apokolyptian invasion, Darkseid commented with much surprise that Batman had been the first one to dodge his Omega Beams. With his martial arts prowess, occasionally augmented by technology, Batman was usually more than a match for any foe he encountered, human or otherwise. Equipment As the head of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce Wayne has access to cutting edge technology and Batman makes good use of it in his field equipment. Batsuit-standard as well as heat-resistant, cold-resistant, and underwater versions. Batarangs-of differing size and effect. These ranged from standard, to explosive, electric, remote, etc. Grapple-gun. This item assisted Batman in scaling the various buildings of Gotham City. Utility Belt - Batman\\'s Utility Belt has compartments to hold several items, the contents of which change according to his needs, and often include items such as flashlights, laser cutters, underwater rebreathers, binoculars, a fingerprinting kit, flashbangs, remote controls for his vehicles, acid/base compounds, anti-toxins, mini-computer, and smoke pellets. Vehicles Batman has used several vehicles in the course of his crimefighting career, including: Batmobile Batwing Batcycle Batboat Appearances Batman: The Animated Series Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero The New Batman Adventures Superman: The Animated Series Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Batman Beyond Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Justice League Justice League Unlimited Static Shock'],\n",
      "    response=\"Batman's biggest enemies are a rogues gallery of iconic villains from the DC Comics universe, each bringing their own unique threats and motivations that challenge his sense of justice. At the top of the list is his arch-nemesis, the Joker, a chaotic clown who embodies anarchy and has pushed Batman to his limits in countless stories with his unpredictable schemes and psychological warfare. Other major foes include Catwoman, a cunning anti-heroine with a complex romantic history with Batman; the Penguin, a crime lord with a penchant for elaborate gadgets and underworld dealings; Two-Face, once Bruce Wayne's friend Harvey Dent, whose split personality drives him to obsessive duality; Bane, a physically dominant brute who once broke Batman both mentally and physically; and Poison Ivy, an eco-terrorist with plant-based powers and a radical environmental agenda. These enemies not only represent different aspects of crime and villainy but also highlight Batman's internal conflicts, like his no-kill rule and moral boundaries. If you're diving into superhero lore, it's fascinating how these characters' backstories often tie into Batman's own history— for example, the Joker might stem from themes of madness, while Bane challenges Batman's physical prowess.

As the Waynes\\' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father\\'s business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler, Alfred Pennyworth , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents\\' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City. As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named Ethan Bennett . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\". As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents\\' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot. For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman\\'s activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police Angel Rojas took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named Ellen Yin , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham. In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date – the Joker . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes. The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham\\'s underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named Bane . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of the Penguin , Man-Bat , Killer Croc , Cluemaster and Catwoman . One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce\\'s career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface. Some time later, a new character entered the Batman\\'s life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally. Barbara Gordon , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordan , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend Poison Ivy from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara\\'s aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt. The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist Dick Grayson was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named Tony Zucco . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick\\'s acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force. Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself John Jones . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called the Joining . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth\\'s atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John\\'s behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as Lex Luthor . At some point later, in the year 2027, Mr. Freeze had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named Nightwing . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever. One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave\\'s titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman\\'s legacy survived into the future. Appearance Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights. He also wears a dark gray costume with a black bat-emblem, black trunks, gloves, and knee high boots. Powers and Abilities Master Acrobat: Excellent in gymnastics and acrobatics.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced.

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang.

He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23.

He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone.

Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory.

Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber.

Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition.

The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt.

After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate . His primary form of combat is a harmonious mixture of Jui-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Judo, Muay Thai, Savate, Karate, Kung Fu, Boxing, Capoeira, Krav Maga, Aikido, and Ninjutsu. Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21. He has mastered Diverse Environmental Training, Security Systems, and illusion/sleight of hand by the time he was 23. He gained even more degrees in Biology, Physics, Advanced Chemistry, and Technology by the time he was 25. He has learned Forensic, Medical Sciences, Expanded Computer and Engineering Sciences, and Expanded Device Pool use of personal powered armor and system, database creation on underworld crime bosses, rogue\\'s gallery foes and other supers; improved material sciences for body armor and micro-machinery by the time he was 26. Has also learned Advanced New Development in Forensic and Medical Sciences. Master Tactician : He is a master strategist and tactician commonly utilizes extremely cunning tactics, strategies, and protocols to outwit his foes. He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture. Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate . His primary form of combat is a harmonious mixture of Jui-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Judo, Muay Thai, Savate, Karate, Kung Fu, Boxing, Capoeira, Krav Maga, Aikido, and Ninjutsu. Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21. He has mastered Diverse Environmental Training, Security Systems, and illusion/sleight of hand by the time he was 23. He gained even more degrees in Biology, Physics, Advanced Chemistry, and Technology by the time he was 25. He has learned Forensic, Medical Sciences, Expanded Computer and Engineering Sciences, and Expanded Device Pool use of personal powered armor and system, database creation on underworld crime bosses, rogue\\'s gallery foes and other supers; improved material sciences for body armor and micro-machinery by the time he was 26.

He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture. Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

(at the time of physical death) Relationships unknown Occupation Groundskeeper (when he was alive) Child Molester (when he was alive) Serial Killer (confirmed after death, not stated either way when he was alive) Appearances 2010 reboot Portrayal Jackie Earle Haley This version of Freddy Krueger is the main antagonist of the A Nightmare on Elm Street Reboot . In this film, Freddy appeared once again as a Dream Demon and a serial killer after his death. In life, he was a child molester. It isn\\'t stated in the film whether or not he\\'d killed anybody when he was alive. After death, he killed the majority of the teenage children who he blames for his death in their nightmares, but Nancy Holbrook and Quentin Smith survived. Unlike the original Freddy Krueger , who, over the course of the series, developed a cheeky and dark humored personality and always cracked puns and jokes when he killed his victims, the reboot version of Freddy seemed to be more in line with how Wes Craven had originally envisioned the character; a much more serious killer.

Freddy initially appeared to have been wrongly accused and seemingly looked like a friendly gardener around the children. The parents, after they heard about the abuse from their children and observed slashes on their skin and clothes that were consistent with his trademark glove , chased Freddy down to a building, in which Freddy locked himself in. One of the parents threw in a container of gasoline with a burning rag. It is implied that he did this to force him to come out, not to intentionally burn him to death. However, he did end up burning him to death. The parents did that to spare their children the trauma of having to testify against him in open court. Having been burned to death, Freddy somehow returned as a vengeful Dream Demon who killed off the teenage children in their dreams one by one as payback against the parents for killing him and/or as payback against them for reporting his actions to their parents. During the climax, Nancy pulled Freddy into the physical world and apparently killed him by severing his gloved-hand and slashed his throat with a broken paper cutter blade. However, Freddy was shown to still be alive and he killed Nancy\\'s mother, Gwen Holbrook, from the mirror reflection. (ENTP) Characterization Powers and abilities Weaknesses Appearance The reboot Freddy\\'s clothing looked almost identical to that of both the Freddy Krueger of the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series and the Freddy Krueger of Freddy\\'s Nightmares; he wore the same red and green sweater and hat as well as sported the iconic glove that he used to kill his victims. The biggest difference were his burns, while the previous Freddy Kruegers did indeed look burnt the remake\\'s Freddy\\'s burns looked much more realistic and made Freddy realistically look like a person who had been horribly burnt. This Freddy also had a noticeable hole in his left cheek as well as one milky cloudy eye and one red blood shot eye. Along with those, this version of Freddy Krueger looked more gaunt and thinner than the previous Freddy Kruegers.

Jackie Earle Haley , who played Freddy, originally auditioned for the role of Glen Lantz in the original Elm Street , but lost to his friend, Johnny Depp . Haley went on and portrayed Freddy in the remake 26 years later. The remake Freddy being a child molester was something that Wes Craven had wanted the original Freddy to be in the first Nightmare film, but it being straight out stated was dropped in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time. However, it is strongly implied at times in the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series. It is, however, straight out stated in Freddy\\'s Nightmares: A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Series , which is a different story than any of the movies, in the episode \" It\\'s My Party and You\\'ll Die If I Want You To \". This version of Freddy makes an appearance as a DLC Character for the reboot and ninth entry of the fighting game series, Mortal Kombat . Despite his resemblance to the 2010 remake\\'s version of Freddy though, he is voiced by Patrick Seitz imitating Robert Englund\\'s voice as the character. This version of Freddy was added as DLC killer for the online survival horror game Dead By Daylight in 2017, along with Quentin Smith as a playable survivor. He is the third killer from a licensed property to be featured in the game, as fellow slasher villains Michael Myers of the Halloween film series and Leatherface of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre film series were added to the game prior to his inclusion.

His equivalent in the comic Freddy Krueger's A Nightmare on Elm Street is Walter Fingle . Biography A severe alcoholic, Mr. Underwood abused Freddy both verbally and physically. His preferred method of beating Freddy was apparently whipping with a belt.

He took the doll the girl was cluching and threw it into a burner. He then sharpened the knives he was going to use in front of her and then stood up straight and approached her as she backed against a wall. Soon after, her life ended. It is possible that this little girl might be one of the ghosts always seen playing jump-rope or hopscotch in the vicinity of the Elm Street House .

He pulled Freddy into the real world, where he was mortal, and defeated him. A badly injured yet determined Freddy fitted both his hands with demonically enhanced razor gloves. Once he has killed Shao Kahn, he will find a way back to the Dream Realm, where he will torment Earthrealm\\'s souls for eternity.\" Appearance Freddy is a badly burned and disfigured being, wearing his trademark fedora, red and green sweater, black pants and shoes.

(Jump) Ending Mortal Kombat (2011): \"Freddy Krueger\\'s bladed hands tore through Shao Kahn. The demonically-enhanced weapons had been more than a match for the emperor\\'s dark magic. Though Freddy had saved Earthrealm, Nightwolf recognized him as an evil spirit, and in a Shamanistic ritual, sent him back to the Dream Realm. But that decision proved ruinous. Freddy did not resist. He welcomed a return to immortality. From the Dream Realm he will again create a Nightmare in Earthrealm.\" Victims In Freddy\\'s Arcade ladder ending at the very end after being sent back to his realm by Nightwolf you can see him killing his first victim. In Mortal Kombat X Mobile (Now called Mortal Kombat Mobile) You can see in his Support Kards that one Victim is burning alive in The Furnace. And another one is about to be killed in her bed. The Fourth victim maybe the same person as the one in the Nightmares Support Kard but this person appears in Freddy\\'s DLC Trailer. Feats of Strength Nightmare Allegiances Faction. Netherrealm.

Trivia If not counting the DC characters, Freddy is the second guest character to appear in the Mortal Kombat series, the first being Kratos . However, he is the first DLC character originated from movies. Unlike Kratos, Freddy is available for both consoles. However, also unlike Kratos, he does not have his own arena. In the movies, Freddy only had claws on his right hand. In this game, however, he has claws on both hands for gameplay mechanics. This marks the first time Freddy is seen using two claws on his hands instead of just one. His first Fatality is based on the way he killed Glen Lantz in the original Nightmare on Elm Street , while his second Fatality is based on the way he killed Kristen Parker in the 4th Nightmare on Elm Street. His X-Ray Move is based on the way he killed Taryn White in the 3rd Nightmare on Elm Street . The names of his first fatality and his X-Ray are lines spoken to two of his victims before he killed them, the first to Ronald Kincaid in response to his comment \"I\\'ll see you in hell\", the second to Taryn White, a former junkie. Much like Shang Tsung , Freddy Krueger feeds off the souls of his victims. Much like Kabal , Freddy\\'s disfigured appearance is the result of being burned alive. Much like how Smoke can dash forward and backwards while turned into a cloud of smoke, Freddy can also move away and forward in a unique way, with his Dream Shift special move. Krueger and Scorpion were both aged 32 before they died and became immortals. They also share a similar power of hellfire. Ed Boon has stated there\\'s a future possibility of more DLC, but it\\'s uncertain at this time. Amongst with Reptile , Kano , Baraka , the bosses and the rest of the DLC characters, Krueger has no battle cry. Freddy Krueger, along with Kintaro , Kratos, Reptile, Shang Tsung, Shao Kahn , Skarlet , and Johnny Cage are the only characters in MK 2011 who do not cry during their Babalities . He is the only character in MK 2011 to have a Fatality that involves the victim only losing one arm. Also, his Tell\\'em Freddy Sent Ya fatality is the only Fatality that can be performed anywhere in the stage. The woman Freddy kills in at the end of his ladder ending bears an extremely strong resemblance to Nancy Thompson on the original poster advertising the first A Nightmare on Elm Street . Nancy Thompson being the woman who originally defeats Freddy at the end of the first film, but is killed in the 3rd film. Like Kratos, Freddy performs a sweep with his clawed gloves instead of his leg. The game uses the body model of JEH\\'s Freddy. However Robert Englund reprises the role once again, making this version of Freddy the only one to be a hybrid of two different versions of Krueger. This also makes Robert Englund the only Freddy actor to have portrayed two different versions of Freddy Krueger, as well as the first time he has voiced Freddy in a video game. For many years since the Freddy DLC was released many Mortal Kombat and Nightmare fans assumed that Patrick Seitz, the voice actor of Scorpion, had lent his talents to voicing the Dream Demon and imitated the vocal style of Robert Englund to sound as close to Freddy as possible. However Ed Boon, one of the creators of the Mortal Kombat series revealed in 2017 that they had in fact gotten to work with Robert Englund for the Freddy DLC, meaning it had been Englund who had voiced Freddy in the fighting game the whole time. Even Patrick Seitz confirmed Ed Boon\\'s statement, as he had many times in the past told fans who asked him that he hadn\\'t voiced Freddy, and didn\\'t even know where the assumption of him doing the voice had come from. Freddy is the first guest character from a film franchise to appear in the Mortal Kombat series. Freddy\\'s appearance as a playable guest character would mark the beginning of several guest characters from horror films making playable appearances in the Mortal Kombat series. Mortal Kombat X features Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th , and Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . He is also the only film guest fighter to have his original actor reprise his voice. Aside from a \"Shhh.\" while performing his throw and a \"No!\" after being thrown in front of a car during The Streetstage fatality, Freddy does not speak during the game. He is only heard laughing in his intro and some of his fatalities, and he also grunts or yells in pain when attacked. All of these effects are voiced by Robert Englund, which was not confirmed until 2017 by Ed Boon on Twitter. Freddy only had claws on his right hand in every appearance of the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. In Mortal Kombat however, he has claws on both hands for gameplay mechanics. Additionally, his bio has stated that he needs two claws in order to defeat Shao Kahn. The majority of the moves in Freddy\\'s move list are named after lines he has said, and a handful are inspired by methods he used to kill his victims in the A Nightmare on Elm Street films. Tell \\'Em Freddy Sent Ya , his first Fatality, is based on the way he killed Glen Lantz in the original Nightmare on Elm Street . The move\\'s name is actually Freddy\\'s response to another victim, Roland Kincaid: the teenager told Freddy, \"I\\'ll see you in hell\", before he was killed. The blood that spews out of the ground is likely a reference to Glenn\\'s death in the same film, as the same thing happened when he was absorbed into his bed. What a Rush , his X-Ray Move, is named after a line he said to Taryn White before he killed her in the 3rd Nightmare on Elm Street . The move itself is based on how he killed her. Krueger\\'s Freddy Fingers , Hell Spike and Glove Toss moves are the same techniques used to kill Terry Fenstein, John Doe and Rick Johnson respectively in the A Nightmare on Elm Street films. Welcome to My Nightmare , his second Fatality, is based on the way he killed Kristen Parker in the 4th Nightmare on Elm Street . The move\\'s name comes from a line he said to Jason Voorhees, in the film Freddy vs. Jason . Power Glove Toss , the enhanced version of Glove Toss , is likely a reference in name to the Nintendo Power Glove, a gaming peripheral that Freddy used during the killing of Spencer Lewis. His Tell \\'Em Freddy Sent Ya Fatality is the only Fatality that can be performed anywhere in the stage. The woman Freddy kills in the end of his ladder ending bears a strong resemblance to Nancy Thompson from the first A Nightmare on Elm Street. This scene itself is a reference to the main promotional artwork of the film, which features Nancy in bed, awake with terror in her eyes while a transparent Freddy and his clawed glove can be seen above her . Freddy is the only character who can actually dodge Shao Kahn\\'s Hammer Throw move without teleporting or simply jumping, with the help of the Nightmare Stance . In a technical sense, he is the only reoccurring guest character in the Mortal Kombat games, appearing in Mortal Kombat (2011) and the mobile version of Mortal Kombat X . Freddy\\'s appearance in the mobile game is very different than his in-game appearance, appearing more like he did in the movies including only one razor glove. He is one of two characters in the mobile version of Mortal Kombat X with a revamped X-Ray attack as compared to their previous appearances. The second being Shao Kahn. In the game, Freddy will slash his opponent into the air and stabbing them in the chest with his glove, but will punch the opponent in the face, breaking their jaw before slashing them in the face shattering their entire skull. In Mortal Kombat Mobile, \"Nightmare\" Freddy Krueger can be upgraded from a Gold Card to a Diamond Card. He is the first mobile-exclusive character in Mortal Kombat X Mobile. In his original challenge, the player would receive a Cyber Armor after beating Hard Mode instead of Freddy\\'s Glove. This was changed in Update 1.11.1.', \"This is about the Freddy Krueger's Glove of A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010 film). If you are looking for one or more other versions of Freddy Krueger's Glove, please check the Freddy Krueger's Glove Disambiguation . Freddy Krueger's Glove is the main weapon of Freddy Krueger . It is based on the ninja weapon neko te. He apparently made it himself, before he was burned to death, in his room in the basement of Badham Preschool . The less said about what he apparently made it for, the better. He isn't actually shown making it. But in the deleted scenes, he is. Description It was redesigned. It was a hybrid of the Original Glove and the New Nightmare Hand, it only missed the blade on the thumb and was not as organic looking as the New Nightmare Hand. It features a cuff near the bottom of the glove and also instead of a backplate, long metal strips connected the finger plates to the cuffs.\"],\n",
      "    response='Freddy Krueger is a iconic fictional character from the horror film series \"A Nightmare on Elm Street,\" created by filmmaker Wes Craven. He\\'s portrayed as a vengeful dream demon who haunts people\\'s nightmares, often depicted with a distinctive burned appearance, a red-and-green striped sweater, a battered fedora hat, and a glove equipped with razor-sharp blades. In the story, he was originally a groundskeeper who faced a tragic fate and returned as a supernatural entity seeking revenge.

He has one brother, Daniel, who is a novelist, and two sisters, Christie (now his personal manager) and Debbie. His parents divorced when he was a teenager and his mother married, as her second husband, Robert Palmer (died 2000), whom Depp called \"an inspiration to me\". The Depp family in the United States began with a French Huguenot immigrant, Pierre Deppe or Dieppe, who settled in Virginia around 1700, part of a refugee colony situated above the falls on the James River. The actor has also surmised that he is part Native American , saying in 2011, \"I guess I have some Native American [in me] somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American, she grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek.\" The family moved frequently during Depp\\'s childhood, and he and his siblings lived in more than 20 different locations, settling in Miramar , Florida, in 1970. In 1978, Depp\\'s parents divorced. He engaged in self-harm as a child, due to the stress of dealing with family problems. He has seven or eight self-inflicted scars. In a 1993 interview, he explained his self-injury by saying, \"My body is a journal in a way. It\\'s like what sailors used to do, where every tattoo meant something, a specific time in your life when you make a mark on yourself, whether you do it yourself with a knife or with a professional tattoo artist\". 1980s With the gift of a guitar from his mother when he was 12, Depp began playing in various garage bands . His first band was in honor of his girlfriend, Meredith. A year after his parents\\' divorce, Depp dropped out of high school to become a rock musician. As he said on Inside the Actors Studio , he attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician. He played with The Kids, a band that enjoyed modest local success. The Kids set out together for Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method, but the group split up before signing a record deal. Depp subsequently collaborated with the band Rock City Angels and co-wrote their song \"Mary\", which appeared on Rock City Angels\\' debut for Geffen Records titled Young Man\\'s Blues . On December 24, 1983, Depp married Lori Anne Allison, a makeup artist and sister of his band\\'s bass player and singer. During Depp\\'s marriage, his wife worked as a makeup artist while he worked a variety of odd jobs, including a telemarketer for pens. His wife introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage , who advised Depp to pursue an acting career. They divorced in 1985. Depp later dated and was engaged to Sherilyn Fenn (whom he met on the set of the 1985 short film Dummies ). Both Sherilyn Fenn and Depp auditioned for the 1986 film Thrashin\\' and they were both cast, with Depp being chosen by the film\\'s director to star as the lead, which would have been Depp\\'s first major role. Depp was later turned down by the film\\'s producer who rejected the directors decision. Career Johnny Depp at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival ===Television=== Depp starred in a lead role on the Fox TV television series, 21 Jump Street , which premiered in 1987. Depp accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest , who inspired him. Depp\\'s long time friend Sal Jenco joined the cast as a semi-co-star as the janitor named Blowfish. The series\\' success turned Depp into a popular teen idol during the late 1980s. He felt \"forced into the role of product.\" Depp decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him. Film roles Depp\\'s first major role was in the 1984 classic horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street , playing the boyfriend of the heroine, Nancy Thompson , (played by Heather Langenkamp ) and one of \\'s victims. He originally went with his friend Jackie Earle Haley as company while he auditioned for a part in the film, however, Depp was given a role instead as Glen Lantz while 26 years later Haley would get the part of Freddy Krueger in the remake. Depp was the first choice and was cast to star in the now classic, 1986 American skater drama film Thrashin\\' , chosen and cast by the director but ultimately rejected by the film\\'s producer. In 1986, he appeared in a secondary role as a Vietnamese -speaking private in Oliver Stone \\'s Platoon . In 1990 he undertook the quirky title role of the Tim Burton film, Edward Scissorhands . The film\\'s success began his long association with Burton. Depp, a fan and long-time friend of writer Hunter S. Thompson , played a version of Thompson (named Raoul Duke ) in 1998\\'s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , based on the writer\\'s pseudobiographical novel of the same name. Depp accompanied Thompson as his road manager on one of the author\\'s last book tours. In 2006, Depp contributed a foreword to Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson , a posthumous biography published by ammobooks.com. Depp paid for most of Thompson\\'s memorial event, complete with fireworks and the shooting of Thompson\\'s ashes by a cannon, in Aspen , Colorado, where Thompson lived. Critics have described Depp\\'s roles as characters who are \"iconic loners.\" Depp has noted this period of his career was full of \"studio defined failures\" and films that were \"box office poison,\" but he thought the studios never understood the films and did not do a good job of marketing. Depp has chosen roles which he found interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office. Depp wearing a mustache and goatee similar to the style used in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl The 2003 Walt Disney Pictures film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a major success, in which Depp\\'s performance as the suave pirate Captain Jack Sparrow was highly praised. Studio bosses were more ambivalent at first, but the character became popular with the movie-going public. According to a survey taken by Fandango , Depp was a major draw for audiences. The film\\'s director, Gore Verbinski , has said that Depp\\'s character closely resembles the actor\\'s personality, but Depp said he modeled the character after Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards . Depp was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for the role. In 2004, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor , for playing Scottish author J. M. Barrie in the film Finding Neverland . Depp next starred as Willy Wonka in the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , a major success at the box office and earning him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy . Depp returned to the role of Jack Sparrow for the sequel Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\\'s Chest , which opened on July 7, 2006 and grossed $135.5 million in the first three days of its U.S. release, breaking a box office record of the highest weekend tally. The next sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean , At World\\'s End , was released May 24, 2007. Depp has said that Sparrow is \"definitely a big part of me\", and he wants to play the role in further sequels. Depp voiced Sparrow in the video game, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow . Johnny Depp\\'s swashbuckling sword talents as developed for the character of Jack Sparrow , were highlighted in the documentary film Reclaiming the Blade . Within the film, Swordmaster Bob Anderson shared his experiences working with Depp on the choreography for The Curse of the Black Pearl . Anderson, who also trained Errol Flynn , another famous Hollywood pirate, described in the film Depp\\'s ability as an actor to pick up the sword to be \"about as good as you can get.\" Depp and Gore Verbinski were executive producers of the album Rogues Gallery, Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs and Chanteys. Depp played the title role of Sweeney Todd in Tim Burton\\'s film adaptation of the musical , for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy . Depp thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and praised Tim Burton for his \"unwavering trust and support.\" Depp played the former Heath Ledger character in the 2009 film, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus along with Jude Law and Colin Farrell . All three actors gave their salaries from the film to Ledger\\'s daughter, Matilda. He portrayed the Mad Hatter in Burton\\'s Alice in Wonderland , and the titular character in Rango . Future roles Depp will appear in a film version of writer Hunter S. Thompson \\'s book, The Rum Diary , portraying the main character, Paul Kemp. In 2007, Depp accepted Warner Bros. \\' proposal to make a film of the gothic soap opera Dark Shadows , a series that aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971. He had been a fan as a child. Depp and Graham King will produce the movie with David Kennedy, who ran Dan Curtis Productions inc. until Curtis died in 2006. He will play Tonto in a future Lone Ranger film. Depp will also produce Hugo Cabret , based on the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret , film a documentary about Keith Richards , and have a cameo appearance in Jack & Jill . Depp will make a cameo appearance in a film adaptation of 21 Jump Street , the show he starred in during the late 1980s. Depp will star in and produce an adaptation of the comic book Rex Mundi . Depp will collaborate with Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides director Rob Marshall again to create a remake of The Thin Man . Depp also showed interest in starring in the next Sin City films, with Robert Rodriguez wanting him to star as Wallace . Collaboration with Tim Burton Depp has collaborated with director and close friend Tim Burton in seven films, beginning with Edward Scissorhands (1990), opposite Winona Ryder and Vincent Price . His next role with Burton was in the 1994 film, Ed Wood . Depp later said that \"within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed.\" At the time, the actor was depressed about films and filmmaking. This part gave him a \"chance to stretch out and have some fun\"; he said working with Landau \"rejuvenated my love for acting\". Producer Scott Rudin once said, \"Basically Johnny Depp is playing Tim Burton in all his movies,\" although Burton personally disapproved of the comment. Depp, however agrees with Rudin\\'s statement. According to Depp, Edward Scissorhands represented Burton\\'s inability to communicate as a teenager. Ed Wood reflected Burton\\'s relationship with Vincent Price (very similar with Edward D. Wood, Jr. and Béla Lugosi ). Depp\\'s Hollywood Walk of Fame star received on November 19, 1999Depp\\'s next venture with Burton was the role of Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow (1999), opposite Christina Ricci . Sleepy Hollow reflected Burton\\'s battle with the Hollywood studio system. For his performance, Depp took inspiration from Angela Lansbury , Roddy McDowall and Basil Rathbone . Depp stated, \"I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl.\" Depp did not work with Burton again until 2005 in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , in which he played Willy Wonka . Depp modeled the character\\'s hair on Anna Wintour . The film was a box office success and received positive critical reception. Gene Wilder , who played Willy Wonka in the 1971 film , initially criticized this version. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released in July, followed by Corpse Bride , for which Depp voiced the character Victor Van Dort, in September. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) followed, bringing Depp his second major award win, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy as well as his third nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor . Burton first gave him an original cast recording of the 1979 stage musical in 2000. Although not a fan of the musical genre, Depp grew to like the tale\\'s treatment. He cited Peter Lorre in Mad Love (1935) as his main influence for the role, and practiced the songs his character would perform while filming Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\\'s End . Although he had performed in musical groups, Depp was initially unsure that he would be able to sustain Stephen Sondheim \\'s lyrics. Depp recorded demos and worked with Bruce Witkin to shape his vocals without a qualified voice coach. In the DVD Reviews section, Entertainment Weekly \\' s Chris Nashawaty gave the film an A minus, stating, \"Depp\\'s soaring voice makes you wonder what other tricks he\\'s been hiding... Watching Depp\\'s barber wield his razors... it\\'s hard not to be reminded of Edward Scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago... and all of the twisted beauty we would\\'ve missed out on had [Burton and Depp] never met.\" In his introduction to Burton on Burton , a book of interviews with the director, Depp called Burton \"...a brother, a friend,...and [a] brave soul\".

Personal life Family and relationships Depp backstage at the Ahmanson Theatre on December 31, 2006Depp was engaged to actress Winona Ryder for three years beginning in July 1990. They met at the Great Balls of Fire! premiere in June 1989; two months later they began dating. The relationship was highly publicized and received much scrutiny by the media and tabloid press. Since 1998, following a four year relationship with British supermodel Kate Moss , Depp has had a relationship with Vanessa Paradis , a French actress and singer whom he met while filming The Ninth Gate . The couple have two children. Daughter Lily-Rose Melody Depp was born May 27, 1999, and son John \"Jack\" Christopher Depp III was born April 9, 2002. In 2007, his daughter recovered from a serious illness, an E. coli infection that began to cause her kidneys to shut down and resulted in an extended hospital stay. To thank Great Ormond Street Hospital , Depp visited the hospital in November 2007 dressed in his Captain Jack Sparrow outfit and spent 4 hours reading stories to the children. In 2008 he donated £1 million (about $2 million) to the hospital. Although Depp has not remarried, he has stated that having children has given him \"real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life, in work, in everything.\" \"You can\\'t plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful ride I was on. It was destiny ; kismet. All the math finally worked.\" The family divides its time between their home in Meudon , located in the suburbs of Paris, Los Angeles, an island he bought in The Bahamas , and their villa in Le Plan-de-la-Tour , a small town 20 km from Saint-Tropez , in the south of France. Depp also acquired a vineyard estate in the Plan-de-la-Tour area in 2007. Legal issues In 1994, Depp was arrested and questioned by police for allegedly causing serious damage to a New York City hotel suite. He was arrested again in 1999 for brawling with paparazzi outside a restaurant while dining in London with Paradis. Tattoos Depp has around 13 tattoos , many of them signifying important persons or events in his life. They include a Native American in profile and a ribbon reading \"Wino Forever\" (originally \"Winona Forever\", altered after his breakup with Winona Ryder) on his right biceps , \"Lily-Rose\" (his daughter\\'s name) over his heart, \"Betty Sue\" (his mother\\'s name) on his left biceps, and a sparrow flying over water with the word \"Jack\" (his son\\'s name; the sparrow is flying towards him rather than away from him as it is in Pirates of the Caribbean ) on his right forearm . Unannounced appearance on set On October 8, 2010, Depp made an unannounced appearance at a London Primary School near where he was filming scenes for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides . He turned up dressed as his character Jack Sparrow after receiving a letter from a pupil asking for his help with a class mutiny. Controversy Comments on U.S. In 2003, Depp\\'s comments about the United States appeared in Germany\\'s Stern magazine : \"America is dumb, is something like a dumb puppy that has big teeth — that can bite and hurt you, aggressive.\" Although he later asserted that the magazine misquoted him and the quotation was taken out of context, Stern stood by its story, as did CNN .com in its coverage of the interview. CNN added his remark that he would like his children \"to see America as a toy, a broken toy. Investigate it a little, check it out, get this feeling and then get out.\" The July 17, 2006 edition of Newsweek reprinted the \"dumb puppy\" quotation, verbatim, in the context of a Letter to the Magazine. Depp has also disagreed with subsequent media reports that he says paint him as a \"European wannabe\", saying that he likes the anonymity of living in France and his simpler life there.

Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek.\" The family moved frequently during Depp\\'s childhood, and he and his siblings lived in more than 20 different locations, settling in Miramar , Florida, in 1970. In 1978, Depp\\'s parents divorced. He engaged in self-harm as a child, due to the stress of dealing with family problems. He has seven or eight self-inflicted scars. In a 1993 interview, he explained his self-injury by saying, \"My body is a journal in a way. It\\'s like what sailors used to do, where every tattoo meant something, a specific time in your life when you make a mark on yourself, whether you do it yourself with a knife or with a professional tattoo artist\". 1980s With the gift of a guitar from his mother when he was 12, Depp began playing in various garage bands . His first band was in honor of his girlfriend, Meredith. A year after his parents\\' divorce, Depp dropped out of high school to become a rock musician. As he said on Inside the Actors Studio , he attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician. He played with The Kids, a band that enjoyed modest local success. The Kids set out together for Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method, but the group split up before signing a record deal. Depp subsequently collaborated with the band Rock City Angels and co-wrote their song \"Mary\", which appeared on Rock City Angels\\' debut for Geffen Records titled Young Man\\'s Blues . On December 24, 1983, Depp married Lori Anne Allison, a makeup artist and sister of his band\\'s bass player and singer. During Depp\\'s marriage, his wife worked as a makeup artist while he worked a variety of odd jobs, including a telemarketer for pens. His wife introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage , who advised Depp to pursue an acting career. They divorced in 1985. Depp later dated and was engaged to Sherilyn Fenn (whom he met on the set of the 1985 short film Dummies ). Both Sherilyn Fenn and Depp auditioned for the 1986 film Thrashin\\' and they were both cast, with Depp being chosen by the film\\'s director to star as the lead, which would have been Depp\\'s first major role. Depp was later turned down by the film\\'s producer who rejected the directors decision. Career Johnny Depp at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival ===Television=== Depp starred in a lead role on the Fox TV television series, 21 Jump Street , which premiered in 1987. Depp accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest , who inspired him. Depp\\'s long time friend Sal Jenco joined the cast as a semi-co-star as the janitor named Blowfish. The series\\' success turned Depp into a popular teen idol during the late 1980s. He felt \"forced into the role of product.\" Depp decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him. Film roles Depp\\'s first major role was in the 1984 classic horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street , playing the boyfriend of the heroine, Nancy Thompson , (played by Heather Langenkamp ) and one of \\'s victims. He originally went with his friend Jackie Earle Haley as company while he auditioned for a part in the film, however, Depp was given a role instead as Glen Lantz while 26 years later Haley would get the part of Freddy Krueger in the remake. Depp was the first choice and was cast to star in the now classic, 1986 American skater drama film Thrashin\\' , chosen and cast by the director but ultimately rejected by the film\\'s producer. In 1986, he appeared in a secondary role as a Vietnamese -speaking private in Oliver Stone \\'s Platoon . In 1990 he undertook the quirky title role of the Tim Burton film, Edward Scissorhands . The film\\'s success began his long association with Burton. Depp, a fan and long-time friend of writer Hunter S. Thompson , played a version of Thompson (named Raoul Duke ) in 1998\\'s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , based on the writer\\'s pseudobiographical novel of the same name. Depp accompanied Thompson as his road manager on one of the author\\'s last book tours. In 2006, Depp contributed a foreword to Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson , a posthumous biography published by ammobooks.com. Depp paid for most of Thompson\\'s memorial event, complete with fireworks and the shooting of Thompson\\'s ashes by a cannon, in Aspen , Colorado, where Thompson lived. Critics have described Depp\\'s roles as characters who are \"iconic loners.\" Depp has noted this period of his career was full of \"studio defined failures\" and films that were \"box office poison,\" but he thought the studios never understood the films and did not do a good job of marketing. Depp has chosen roles which he found interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office. Depp wearing a mustache and goatee similar to the style used in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl The 2003 Walt Disney Pictures film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a major success, in which Depp\\'s performance as the suave pirate Captain Jack Sparrow was highly praised. Studio bosses were more ambivalent at first, but the character became popular with the movie-going public. According to a survey taken by Fandango , Depp was a major draw for audiences. The film\\'s director, Gore Verbinski , has said that Depp\\'s character closely resembles the actor\\'s personality, but Depp said he modeled the character after Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards . Depp was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for the role. In 2004, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor , for playing Scottish author J. M. Barrie in the film Finding Neverland . Depp next starred as Willy Wonka in the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , a major success at the box office and earning him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy . Depp returned to the role of Jack Sparrow for the sequel Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\\'s Chest , which opened on July 7, 2006 and grossed $135.5 million in the first three days of its U.S. release, breaking a box office record of the highest weekend tally. The next sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean , At World\\'s End , was released May 24, 2007. Depp has said that Sparrow is \"definitely a big part of me\", and he wants to play the role in further sequels. Depp voiced Sparrow in the video game, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow . Johnny Depp\\'s swashbuckling sword talents as developed for the character of Jack Sparrow , were highlighted in the documentary film Reclaiming the Blade . Within the film, Swordmaster Bob Anderson shared his experiences working with Depp on the choreography for The Curse of the Black Pearl . Anderson, who also trained Errol Flynn , another famous Hollywood pirate, described in the film Depp\\'s ability as an actor to pick up the sword to be \"about as good as you can get.\" Depp and Gore Verbinski were executive producers of the album Rogues Gallery, Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs and Chanteys. Depp played the title role of Sweeney Todd in Tim Burton\\'s film adaptation of the musical , for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy . Depp thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and praised Tim Burton for his \"unwavering trust and support.\" Depp played the former Heath Ledger character in the 2009 film, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus along with Jude Law and Colin Farrell . All three actors gave their salaries from the film to Ledger\\'s daughter, Matilda. He portrayed the Mad Hatter in Burton\\'s Alice in Wonderland , and the titular character in Rango . Future roles Depp will appear in a film version of writer Hunter S. Thompson \\'s book, The Rum Diary , portraying the main character, Paul Kemp. In 2007, Depp accepted Warner Bros. \\' proposal to make a film of the gothic soap opera Dark Shadows , a series that aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971. He had been a fan as a child. Depp and Graham King will produce the movie with David Kennedy, who ran Dan Curtis Productions inc. until Curtis died in 2006. He will play Tonto in a future Lone Ranger film. Depp will also produce Hugo Cabret , based on the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret , film a documentary about Keith Richards , and have a cameo appearance in Jack & Jill . Depp will make a cameo appearance in a film adaptation of 21 Jump Street , the show he starred in during the late 1980s. Depp will star in and produce an adaptation of the comic book Rex Mundi . Depp will collaborate with Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides director Rob Marshall again to create a remake of The Thin Man . Depp also showed interest in starring in the next Sin City films, with Robert Rodriguez wanting him to star as Wallace . Collaboration with Tim Burton Depp has collaborated with director and close friend Tim Burton in seven films, beginning with Edward Scissorhands (1990), opposite Winona Ryder and Vincent Price . His next role with Burton was in the 1994 film, Ed Wood . Depp later said that \"within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed.\" At the time, the actor was depressed about films and filmmaking. This part gave him a \"chance to stretch out and have some fun\"; he said working with Landau \"rejuvenated my love for acting\". Producer Scott Rudin once said, \"Basically Johnny Depp is playing Tim Burton in all his movies,\" although Burton personally disapproved of the comment. Depp, however agrees with Rudin\\'s statement. According to Depp, Edward Scissorhands represented Burton\\'s inability to communicate as a teenager. Ed Wood reflected Burton\\'s relationship with Vincent Price (very similar with Edward D. Wood, Jr. and Béla Lugosi ). Depp\\'s Hollywood Walk of Fame star received on November 19, 1999Depp\\'s next venture with Burton was the role of Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow (1999), opposite Christina Ricci . Sleepy Hollow reflected Burton\\'s battle with the Hollywood studio system. For his performance, Depp took inspiration from Angela Lansbury , Roddy McDowall and Basil Rathbone . Depp stated, \"I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl.\" Depp did not work with Burton again until 2005 in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , in which he played Willy Wonka . Depp modeled the character\\'s hair on Anna Wintour . The film was a box office success and received positive critical reception. Gene Wilder , who played Willy Wonka in the 1971 film , initially criticized this version. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released in July, followed by Corpse Bride , for which Depp voiced the character Victor Van Dort, in September. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) followed, bringing Depp his second major award win, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy as well as his third nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor . Burton first gave him an original cast recording of the 1979 stage musical in 2000. Although not a fan of the musical genre, Depp grew to like the tale\\'s treatment. He cited Peter Lorre in Mad Love (1935) as his main influence for the role, and practiced the songs his character would perform while filming Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\\'s End . Although he had performed in musical groups, Depp was initially unsure that he would be able to sustain Stephen Sondheim \\'s lyrics. Depp recorded demos and worked with Bruce Witkin to shape his vocals without a qualified voice coach. In the DVD Reviews section, Entertainment Weekly \\' s Chris Nashawaty gave the film an A minus, stating, \"Depp\\'s soaring voice makes you wonder what other tricks he\\'s been hiding... Watching Depp\\'s barber wield his razors... it\\'s hard not to be reminded of Edward Scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago... and all of the twisted beauty we would\\'ve missed out on had [Burton and Depp] never met.\" In his introduction to Burton on Burton , a book of interviews with the director, Depp called Burton \"...a brother, a friend,...and [a] brave soul\". The next Depp-Burton collaboration was Alice in Wonderland (2010). Depp played the Mad Hatter alongside Helena Bonham Carter , Anne Hathaway and Alan Rickman . Other interests Depp in April 2011===Music=== As a guitar player, Depp has played slide guitar on the Oasis song \"Fade In-Out\" (from Be Here Now , 1997), as well as on \"Fade Away (Warchild Version)\" (b-side of the \" Don\\'t Go Away \" single). He also played acoustic guitar in the movie Chocolat and on the soundtrack to Once Upon a Time in Mexico . He is a friend of The Pogues \\' Shane MacGowan , and performed on MacGowan\\'s first solo album. He was also a member of P , a group featuring Butthole Surfers singer Gibby Haynes , Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones . He has appeared in Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers \\' music video \" Into the Great Wide Open \". Winemaker and restaurateur Depp and Paradis grow grapes and have wine making facilities in their vineyard in Plan-de-la-Tour north of Saint-Tropez . He is known for a fondness of French wines : among Depp\\'s favorites are the Bordeaux wines Château Calon-Ségur , Château Cheval Blanc and Château Pétrus , and the Burgundy wine Domaine de la Romanée-Conti . Interviewed in Madame Figaro , he stated, \"With those wines, you reach nirvana \". Along with Sean Penn , John Malkovich and Mick Hucknall , Depp co-owned the Parisian restaurant-bar Man Ray , located near the Champs-Élysées . Personal life Family and relationships Depp backstage at the Ahmanson Theatre on December 31, 2006Depp was engaged to actress Winona Ryder for three years beginning in July 1990. They met at the Great Balls of Fire! premiere in June 1989; two months later they began dating. The relationship was highly publicized and received much scrutiny by the media and tabloid press. Since 1998, following a four year relationship with British supermodel Kate Moss , Depp has had a relationship with Vanessa Paradis , a French actress and singer whom he met while filming The Ninth Gate . The couple have two children. Daughter Lily-Rose Melody Depp was born May 27, 1999, and son John \"Jack\" Christopher Depp III was born April 9, 2002. In 2007, his daughter recovered from a serious illness, an E. coli infection that began to cause her kidneys to shut down and resulted in an extended hospital stay. To thank Great Ormond Street Hospital , Depp visited the hospital in November 2007 dressed in his Captain Jack Sparrow outfit and spent 4 hours reading stories to the children. In 2008 he donated £1 million (about $2 million) to the hospital. Although Depp has not remarried, he has stated that having children has given him \"real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life, in work, in everything.\" \"You can\\'t plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful ride I was on. It was destiny ; kismet. All the math finally worked.\" The family divides its time between their home in Meudon , located in the suburbs of Paris, Los Angeles, an island he bought in The Bahamas , and their villa in Le Plan-de-la-Tour , a small town 20 km from Saint-Tropez , in the south of France. Depp also acquired a vineyard estate in the Plan-de-la-Tour area in 2007. Legal issues In 1994, Depp was arrested and questioned by police for allegedly causing serious damage to a New York City hotel suite. He was arrested again in 1999 for brawling with paparazzi outside a restaurant while dining in London with Paradis. Tattoos Depp has around 13 tattoos , many of them signifying important persons or events in his life. They include a Native American in profile and a ribbon reading \"Wino Forever\" (originally \"Winona Forever\", altered after his breakup with Winona Ryder) on his right biceps , \"Lily-Rose\" (his daughter\\'s name) over his heart, \"Betty Sue\" (his mother\\'s name) on his left biceps, and a sparrow flying over water with the word \"Jack\" (his son\\'s name; the sparrow is flying towards him rather than away from him as it is in Pirates of the Caribbean ) on his right forearm . Unannounced appearance on set On October 8, 2010, Depp made an unannounced appearance at a London Primary School near where he was filming scenes for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides . He turned up dressed as his character Jack Sparrow after receiving a letter from a pupil asking for his help with a class mutiny. Controversy Comments on U.S. In 2003, Depp\\'s comments about the United States appeared in Germany\\'s Stern magazine : \"America is dumb, is something like a dumb puppy that has big teeth — that can bite and hurt you, aggressive.\" Although he later asserted that the magazine misquoted him and the quotation was taken out of context, Stern stood by its story, as did CNN .com in its coverage of the interview. CNN added his remark that he would like his children \"to see America as a toy, a broken toy. Investigate it a little, check it out, get this feeling and then get out.\" The July 17, 2006 edition of Newsweek reprinted the \"dumb puppy\" quotation, verbatim, in the context of a Letter to the Magazine. Depp has also disagreed with subsequent media reports that he says paint him as a \"European wannabe\", saying that he likes the anonymity of living in France and his simpler life there.

Contents 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Soundtrack 4 Box Office 5 Reception 6 Trivia 7 Sources Plot While at the Springwood Diner with his friend Kris Fowles , Dean Russell fell asleep at the table and met a man covered in burn scars, wearing a red and green sweater and a clawed glove on his right hand. The burned man cut Dean\\'s throat in the Dream World , but in the physical world it appeared that Dean was cutting his own throat as friend and waitress Nancy Holbrook looked on with Kris. At Dean\\'s funeral, Kris saw a photograph of herself and Dean as children, but could not recall ever knowing Dean before high school. Kris then began to dream about the burned man herself and refused to go to sleep for fear that she would die in her dreams. Jesse Braun (Thomas Dekker), Kris\\'s ex-boyfriend, showed up at her house to keep her company while she slept, but Kris met the burned man in her dreams and was murdered. Covered in blood, Jesse ran to Nancy\\'s house to try to explain what happened. He learned that Nancy has also been having dreams about the same man. Jesse was apprehended by the police under suspicion of murdering Kris, and is killed by Freddy when he falls asleep in his jail cell. With her friends dying, Nancy begins to question what everyone\\'s connection is to each other, given that none of them can remember each other before their teenage years. Eventually, Nancy and her friend Quentin Smith discover that all of them, including more children, attended the same preschool together. Nancy\\'s mother, Gwen Holbrook , reluctantly tells Nancy and Quentin that there was a gardener at the preschool, Fred Krueger, who hurt Nancy and the rest of the kids. Gwen explains that Nancy was his favorite, and came home one day telling her mom about Freddy\\'s \"magic cave\" and the things that happened down there. Gwen claims Krueger skipped town before he was arrested. Nancy does not believe her and attempts to track down the remaining kids from the school. Nancy eventually discovers that all of the other kids, Lisa Harper, Bret Tanzer, Sukari McGill, Nancy Lumb, Elizabeth Cook, Marcus Yeon, Carrie Bush, and Craig Jackson, have been killed, most of them in their sleep. Meanwhile, Quentin tries to accept that everything is nothing more than repressed memories, but he falls asleep during swim practice and witnesses what really happened to Krueger. Quentin sees everyone\\'s parents hunt down Krueger, and then burn him alive. Quentin and Nancy confront Quentin\\'s father, Alan Smith , questioning the reality that they murdered Krueger with no actual evidence that he had committed any crime. Nancy and Quentin, who both begin sporadically dreaming while they are awake as a result of insomnia, decide to go to the preschool and learn what they can about Krueger. On the way, Nancy falls asleep and is attacked by Freddy, but when Quentin wakes her up they discover she has pulled a piece of Freddy\\'s sweater out of the dreamworld and into the physical world. Quentin takes Nancy to the hospital for cuts on her arm; there, he steals some adrenaline and a syringe to help them stay awake. Nancy and Quentin leave the hospital and eventually make it to the preschool. Quentin uncovers Krueger\\'s \"magic cave\" and the evidence that proves Krueger was physically and sexually abusing all of the children. Nancy decides the only way to end this is to pull Krueger out of their dreams and kill him in reality. Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Freddy, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger then goes after Nancy and explains that he intentionally left her for last so she would stay awake long enough that when she finally fell asleep she would no longer be able to wake back up. While Nancy struggles with Freddy, Quentin wakes and uses the adrenaline to bring Nancy up and pull Freddy into reality. With Krueger distracted by Quentin, Nancy uses a broken paper cutter blade to cut Freddy\\'s gloved hand off, and then slice his throat, seemingly killing him. Afterward, Nancy torches the secret room, with Krueger\\'s body left inside to burn, while she and Quentin leave.

Reception The film received very negative reviews from critics and fans. Based on 165 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, A Nightmare on Elm Street holds a 15% overall rating from critics, with an average score of 3.7 out of 10, The consensus at Rotten Tomatoes was that the film was \"visually faithful but lacking the depth and subversive twists that made the original so memorable, the Nightmare on Elm Street remake lives up to its title in the worst possible way.\" By comparison, Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 35, based on 25 reviews. CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade cinemagoers gave the film was a \"C-plus\" on an A+ to F scale, with exit polls showing that audiences were evenly divided between males and females, with 40 percent between 18–24 years of age and 20 percent under 18. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave it a \"B–\" and concluded that, \"I did jump a few times, and I liked Haley\\'s dour malevolence, but overall, the new Nightmare on Elm Street is a by-the-numbers bad dream that plays a little too much like a corporately ordered rerun. One, two, Freddy\\'s coming for you. Three, four, we\\'ve been there before\". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the acting calling it \"lethargically lifeless\" and criticized Haley\\'s portrayal of Krueger, saying, \"Even with his electronically deepened voice and a pointless amount of backstory, there\\'s just no replacing Englund\". Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1 star out of 4, writing in his review, \"I stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what? Are we supposed to be scared? Is the sudden clanging chord supposed to evoke a fearful Pavlovian response?\" Trivia Katie Cassidy who plays Kris Fowles and Thomas Dekker who plays Jesse Braun both starred in the same episode of 7th Heaven , \" Red Socks \" (2005). Aaron Yoo plays the role of Chewie in the reboot of Friday the 13th . He also plays the role of Marcus Yeon in this remake. Therefore he plays two characters in the A Nightmare On Elm Street / Friday the 13th universes. A Nightmare On Elm Street won \"Best Horror Film\" at the 2011 People\\'s Choice Awards, though its reception was very negative. Some soundtracks from the original movie are used in this film. This film reuses concepts from all the films to date in the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series. Some scenes from the original film are almost shot to shot in the remake. Some New Nightmare aspects are lamp shade hanging; but difficult to spot unless one is from Chicago. There are some quotes from the original Freddy that are used by the remake Freddy.

It is a book adaptation of the film of the same name . It shouldn\\'t be confused with the novelization of the film of the same name . Differences from the film The book doesn\\'t have the pre-dream opening scene. It goes straight to Kristen Parker \\'s dream. The girl on the tricycle says \"hello\" instead of \"hi\". The girl on the tricycle says \"I have to go now.\" instead of \"I gotta go now.\". The girl on the tricycle says \"bye\" to Kristen. Where Kristen says \"Wait! Little girl! Don\\'t go in there!\" in the film, the words \"little girl\" are left out. The part where Kristen calls \"Little girl!\" to the girl on the tricyle inside the house is left out. When Kristen Park and the girl on the tricycle are in the Dream World \\'s boiler room, and furnace opens up and Kristen sees inside it. It contains charred bones, ashes, and a tricycle \"identical to the little girl\\'s- only charred\". The implication is rather obvious. The line \"Put me down. You\\'re hurting me.\" is left out. One has to wonder if something is being implied by this line in the film. Instead of Kristen screaming, the corpse of the girl who had been on the tricycle screams. Kristen looks at her and notices that she is dead BEFORE this happens. When the tricycle rolls into Kristen\\'s room at Westin Hills Psychiatric Hospital , it\\'s simply described as \"leaving tire tracks\". No mention is made of the tire tracks apparently being made in blood, like in the film. The line, \"Welcome to prime time, bitch!\" is left out. Where Nancy Thompson said \"Let him go, you bastard.\" in the film, the word \"bastard\" is replaced by the word \"creep\". Where Freddy Krueger wrote \"Come and get him, bitch.\" on Joey\\'s chest in the film, the word \"bitch\" is left out. In Penny Bros. Auto Salvage , the line \"Bury the fucking thing!\" is left out.

      "    response='\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" (2010) is a horror film reboot that follows a group of teenagers plagued by terrifying dreams of a scarred, vengeful man named Freddy Krueger, who uses a clawed glove to kill his victims in the dream world—deaths that carry over into reality.

Key characters include Nancy (Rooney Mara), Quentin (Kyle Gallner), Kris Fowles (Katie Cassidy), and Freddy himself (Jackie Earle Haley).

Founded in 1967 by producer Robert Shaye (Bob Shaye), New Line Cinema had a small string of financial failures. The original A Nightmare on Elm Street was its first successful film, released in 1984.

He has one brother, Daniel, who is a novelist, and two sisters, Christie (now his personal manager) and Debbie. His parents divorced when he was a teenager and his mother married, as her second husband, Robert Palmer (died 2000), whom Depp called \"an inspiration to me\". The Depp family in the United States began with a French Huguenot immigrant, Pierre Deppe or Dieppe, who settled in Virginia around 1700, part of a refugee colony situated above the falls on the James River. The actor has also surmised that he is part Native American , saying in 2011, \"I guess I have some Native American [in me] somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American, she grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek.\" The family moved frequently during Depp\\'s childhood, and he and his siblings lived in more than 20 different locations, settling in Miramar , Florida, in 1970. In 1978, Depp\\'s parents divorced. He engaged in self-harm as a child, due to the stress of dealing with family problems. He has seven or eight self-inflicted scars. In a 1993 interview, he explained his self-injury by saying, \"My body is a journal in a way. It\\'s like what sailors used to do, where every tattoo meant something, a specific time in your life when you make a mark on yourself, whether you do it yourself with a knife or with a professional tattoo artist\". 1980s With the gift of a guitar from his mother when he was 12, Depp began playing in various garage bands . His first band was in honor of his girlfriend, Meredith. A year after his parents\\' divorce, Depp dropped out of high school to become a rock musician. As he said on Inside the Actors Studio , he attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician. He played with The Kids, a band that enjoyed modest local success. The Kids set out together for Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method, but the group split up before signing a record deal. Depp subsequently collaborated with the band Rock City Angels and co-wrote their song \"Mary\", which appeared on Rock City Angels\\' debut for Geffen Records titled Young Man\\'s Blues . On December 24, 1983, Depp married Lori Anne Allison, a makeup artist and sister of his band\\'s bass player and singer. During Depp\\'s marriage, his wife worked as a makeup artist while he worked a variety of odd jobs, including a telemarketer for pens. His wife introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage , who advised Depp to pursue an acting career. They divorced in 1985. Depp later dated and was engaged to Sherilyn Fenn (whom he met on the set of the 1985 short film Dummies ). Both Sherilyn Fenn and Depp auditioned for the 1986 film Thrashin\\' and they were both cast, with Depp being chosen by the film\\'s director to star as the lead, which would have been Depp\\'s first major role. Depp was later turned down by the film\\'s producer who rejected the directors decision. Career Johnny Depp at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival ===Television=== Depp starred in a lead role on the Fox TV television series, 21 Jump Street , which premiered in 1987. Depp accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest , who inspired him. Depp\\'s long time friend Sal Jenco joined the cast as a semi-co-star as the janitor named Blowfish. The series\\' success turned Depp into a popular teen idol during the late 1980s. He felt \"forced into the role of product.\" Depp decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him. Film roles Depp\\'s first major role was in the 1984 classic horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street , playing the boyfriend of the heroine, Nancy Thompson , (played by Heather Langenkamp ) and one of \\'s victims. He originally went with his friend Jackie Earle Haley as company while he auditioned for a part in the film, however, Depp was given a role instead as Glen Lantz while 26 years later Haley would get the part of Freddy Krueger in the remake. Depp was the first choice and was cast to star in the now classic, 1986 American skater drama film Thrashin\\' , chosen and cast by the director but ultimately rejected by the film\\'s producer. In 1986, he appeared in a secondary role as a Vietnamese -speaking private in Oliver Stone \\'s Platoon . In 1990 he undertook the quirky title role of the Tim Burton film, Edward Scissorhands . The film\\'s success began his long association with Burton. Depp, a fan and long-time friend of writer Hunter S. Thompson , played a version of Thompson (named Raoul Duke ) in 1998\\'s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , based on the writer\\'s pseudobiographical novel of the same name. Depp accompanied Thompson as his road manager on one of the author\\'s last book tours. In 2006, Depp contributed a foreword to Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson , a posthumous biography published by ammobooks.com. Depp paid for most of Thompson\\'s memorial event, complete with fireworks and the shooting of Thompson\\'s ashes by a cannon, in Aspen , Colorado, where Thompson lived. Critics have described Depp\\'s roles as characters who are \"iconic loners.\" Depp has noted this period of his career was full of \"studio defined failures\" and films that were \"box office poison,\" but he thought the studios never understood the films and did not do a good job of marketing. Depp has chosen roles which he found interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office. Depp wearing a mustache and goatee similar to the style used in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl The 2003 Walt Disney Pictures film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a major success, in which Depp\\'s performance as the suave pirate Captain Jack Sparrow was highly praised. Studio bosses were more ambivalent at first, but the character became popular with the movie-going public. According to a survey taken by Fandango , Depp was a major draw for audiences. The film\\'s director, Gore Verbinski , has said that Depp\\'s character closely resembles the actor\\'s personality, but Depp said he modeled the character after Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards . Depp was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for the role. In 2004, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor , for playing Scottish author J. M. Barrie in the film Finding Neverland . Depp next starred as Willy Wonka in the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , a major success at the box office and earning him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy . Depp returned to the role of Jack Sparrow for the sequel Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\\'s Chest , which opened on July 7, 2006 and grossed $135.5 million in the first three days of its U.S. release, breaking a box office record of the highest weekend tally. The next sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean , At World\\'s End , was released May 24, 2007. Depp has said that Sparrow is \"definitely a big part of me\", and he wants to play the role in further sequels. Depp voiced Sparrow in the video game, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow . Johnny Depp\\'s swashbuckling sword talents as developed for the character of Jack Sparrow , were highlighted in the documentary film Reclaiming the Blade . Within the film, Swordmaster Bob Anderson shared his experiences working with Depp on the choreography for The Curse of the Black Pearl . Anderson, who also trained Errol Flynn , another famous Hollywood pirate, described in the film Depp\\'s ability as an actor to pick up the sword to be \"about as good as you can get.\" Depp and Gore Verbinski were executive producers of the album Rogues Gallery, Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs and Chanteys. Depp played the title role of Sweeney Todd in Tim Burton\\'s film adaptation of the musical , for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy . Depp thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and praised Tim Burton for his \"unwavering trust and support.\" Depp played the former Heath Ledger character in the 2009 film, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus along with Jude Law and Colin Farrell . All three actors gave their salaries from the film to Ledger\\'s daughter, Matilda. He portrayed the Mad Hatter in Burton\\'s Alice in Wonderland , and the titular character in Rango . Future roles Depp will appear in a film version of writer Hunter S. Thompson \\'s book, The Rum Diary , portraying the main character, Paul Kemp. In 2007, Depp accepted Warner Bros. \\' proposal to make a film of the gothic soap opera Dark Shadows , a series that aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971. He had been a fan as a child. Depp and Graham King will produce the movie with David Kennedy, who ran Dan Curtis Productions inc. until Curtis died in 2006. He will play Tonto in a future Lone Ranger film. Depp will also produce Hugo Cabret , based on the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret , film a documentary about Keith Richards , and have a cameo appearance in Jack & Jill . Depp will make a cameo appearance in a film adaptation of 21 Jump Street , the show he starred in during the late 1980s. Depp will star in and produce an adaptation of the comic book Rex Mundi . Depp will collaborate with Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides director Rob Marshall again to create a remake of The Thin Man . Depp also showed interest in starring in the next Sin City films, with Robert Rodriguez wanting him to star as Wallace . Collaboration with Tim Burton Depp has collaborated with director and close friend Tim Burton in seven films, beginning with Edward Scissorhands (1990), opposite Winona Ryder and Vincent Price . His next role with Burton was in the 1994 film, Ed Wood . Depp later said that \"within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed.\" At the time, the actor was depressed about films and filmmaking. This part gave him a \"chance to stretch out and have some fun\"; he said working with Landau \"rejuvenated my love for acting\". Producer Scott Rudin once said, \"Basically Johnny Depp is playing Tim Burton in all his movies,\" although Burton personally disapproved of the comment. Depp, however agrees with Rudin\\'s statement. According to Depp, Edward Scissorhands represented Burton\\'s inability to communicate as a teenager. Ed Wood reflected Burton\\'s relationship with Vincent Price (very similar with Edward D. Wood, Jr. and Béla Lugosi ). Depp\\'s Hollywood Walk of Fame star received on November 19, 1999Depp\\'s next venture with Burton was the role of Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow (1999), opposite Christina Ricci . Sleepy Hollow reflected Burton\\'s battle with the Hollywood studio system. For his performance, Depp took inspiration from Angela Lansbury , Roddy McDowall and Basil Rathbone . Depp stated, \"I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl.\" Depp did not work with Burton again until 2005 in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , in which he played Willy Wonka . Depp modeled the character\\'s hair on Anna Wintour . The film was a box office success and received positive critical reception. Gene Wilder , who played Willy Wonka in the 1971 film , initially criticized this version. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released in July, followed by Corpse Bride , for which Depp voiced the character Victor Van Dort, in September. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) followed, bringing Depp his second major award win, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy as well as his third nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor . Burton first gave him an original cast recording of the 1979 stage musical in 2000. Although not a fan of the musical genre, Depp grew to like the tale\\'s treatment. He cited Peter Lorre in Mad Love (1935) as his main influence for the role, and practiced the songs his character would perform while filming Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\\'s End . Although he had performed in musical groups, Depp was initially unsure that he would be able to sustain Stephen Sondheim \\'s lyrics. Depp recorded demos and worked with Bruce Witkin to shape his vocals without a qualified voice coach. In the DVD Reviews section, Entertainment Weekly \\' s Chris Nashawaty gave the film an A minus, stating, \"Depp\\'s soaring voice makes you wonder what other tricks he\\'s been hiding... Watching Depp\\'s barber wield his razors... it\\'s hard not to be reminded of Edward Scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago... and all of the twisted beauty we would\\'ve missed out on had [Burton and Depp] never met.\" In his introduction to Burton on Burton , a book of interviews with the director, Depp called Burton \"...a brother, a friend,...and [a] brave soul\". The next Depp-Burton collaboration was Alice in Wonderland (2010). Depp played the Mad Hatter alongside Helena Bonham Carter , Anne Hathaway and Alan Rickman . Other interests Depp in April 2011===Music=== As a guitar player, Depp has played slide guitar on the Oasis song \"Fade In-Out\" (from Be Here Now , 1997), as well as on \"Fade Away (Warchild Version)\" (b-side of the \" Don\\'t Go Away \" single).

He is a friend of The Pogues \\' Shane MacGowan , and performed on MacGowan\\'s first solo album. He was also a member of P , a group featuring Butthole Surfers singer Gibby Haynes , Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones . He has appeared in Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers \\' music video \" Into the Great Wide Open \". Winemaker and restaurateur Depp and Paradis grow grapes and have wine making facilities in their vineyard in Plan-de-la-Tour north of Saint-Tropez . He is known for a fondness of French wines : among Depp\\'s favorites are the Bordeaux wines Château Calon-Ségur , Château Cheval Blanc and Château Pétrus , and the Burgundy wine Domaine de la Romanée-Conti . Interviewed in Madame Figaro , he stated, \"With those wines, you reach nirvana \". Along with Sean Penn , John Malkovich and Mick Hucknall , Depp co-owned the Parisian restaurant-bar Man Ray , located near the Champs-Élysées . Personal life Family and relationships Depp backstage at the Ahmanson Theatre on December 31, 2006Depp was engaged to actress Winona Ryder for three years beginning in July 1990. They met at the Great Balls of Fire! premiere in June 1989; two months later they began dating. The relationship was highly publicized and received much scrutiny by the media and tabloid press. Since 1998, following a four year relationship with British supermodel Kate Moss , Depp has had a relationship with Vanessa Paradis , a French actress and singer whom he met while filming The Ninth Gate . The couple have two children. Daughter Lily-Rose Melody Depp was born May 27, 1999, and son John \"Jack\" Christopher Depp III was born April 9, 2002. In 2007, his daughter recovered from a serious illness, an E. coli infection that began to cause her kidneys to shut down and resulted in an extended hospital stay. To thank Great Ormond Street Hospital , Depp visited the hospital in November 2007 dressed in his Captain Jack Sparrow outfit and spent 4 hours reading stories to the children. In 2008 he donated £1 million (about $2 million) to the hospital. Although Depp has not remarried, he has stated that having children has given him \"real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life, in work, in everything.\" \"You can\\'t plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful ride I was on. It was destiny ; kismet. All the math finally worked.\" The family divides its time between their home in Meudon , located in the suburbs of Paris, Los Angeles, an island he bought in The Bahamas , and their villa in Le Plan-de-la-Tour , a small town 20 km from Saint-Tropez , in the south of France. Depp also acquired a vineyard estate in the Plan-de-la-Tour area in 2007. Legal issues In 1994, Depp was arrested and questioned by police for allegedly causing serious damage to a New York City hotel suite. He was arrested again in 1999 for brawling with paparazzi outside a restaurant while dining in London with Paradis. Tattoos Depp has around 13 tattoos , many of them signifying important persons or events in his life. They include a Native American in profile and a ribbon reading \"Wino Forever\" (originally \"Winona Forever\", altered after his breakup with Winona Ryder) on his right biceps , \"Lily-Rose\" (his daughter\\'s name) over his heart, \"Betty Sue\" (his mother\\'s name) on his left biceps, and a sparrow flying over water with the word \"Jack\" (his son\\'s name; the sparrow is flying towards him rather than away from him as it is in Pirates of the Caribbean ) on his right forearm . Unannounced appearance on set On October 8, 2010, Depp made an unannounced appearance at a London Primary School near where he was filming scenes for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides . He turned up dressed as his character Jack Sparrow after receiving a letter from a pupil asking for his help with a class mutiny. Controversy Comments on U.S. In 2003, Depp\\'s comments about the United States appeared in Germany\\'s Stern magazine : \"America is dumb, is something like a dumb puppy that has big teeth — that can bite and hurt you, aggressive.\" Although he later asserted that the magazine misquoted him and the quotation was taken out of context, Stern stood by its story, as did CNN .com in its coverage of the interview. CNN added his remark that he would like his children \"to see America as a toy, a broken toy. Investigate it a little, check it out, get this feeling and then get out.\" The July 17, 2006 edition of Newsweek reprinted the \"dumb puppy\" quotation, verbatim, in the context of a Letter to the Magazine. Depp has also disagreed with subsequent media reports that he says paint him as a \"European wannabe\", saying that he likes the anonymity of living in France and his simpler life there.

      "Prediction(\n",
      "    reasoning='Based on the user\\'s question about similarities between Batman comics and movies, I am considering the provided context, which details various Batman films, comic works, and their influences. The context highlights how movies like Tim Burton\\'s Batman, Christopher Nolan\\'s Dark Knight Trilogy, and others draw from comic sources, such as Frank Miller\\'s \"The Dark Knight\" series, while adapting elements for cinematic appeal. The student\\'s goal is to explore similarities and differences in storylines, characters, and themes to assess accuracy and evolution, so my response should address these directly. The pragmatic need suggests the user wants practical insights for content consumption or discussions, so I\\'ll make the answer anticipatory by noting key comparisons, potential discrepancies (e.g., comics often have darker, more complex themes, while movies adapt for broader audiences), and suggestions for next steps to encourage engagement. This approach ensures the answer is cooperative, informative, and proactive in handling follow-ups, such as asking for specific examples or recommendations.',\n",
      "    cooperative_answer='Yes, Batman comics and movies share many core similarities, but there are also notable differences in how storylines, characters, and themes are adapted, which can affect how faithfully the essence of the comics is captured. For instance, both mediums feature Batman\\'s origin as Bruce Wayne, his fight against villains like the Joker and Two-Face, and themes of justice, vigilantism, and moral ambiguity. Comics like Frank Miller\\'s \"The Dark Knight\" have directly influenced movies, such as Christopher Nolan\\'s trilogy (e.g., \"The Dark Knight Rises\" borrows elements like Batman\\'s retirement and return, as well as his confrontations with foes). However, movies often simplify complex comic storylines for runtime and audience appeal, resulting in a more action-oriented or visually spectacular take—Nolan\\'s films emphasize realism and psychological depth, while earlier ones like Tim Burton\\'s are more gothic and stylized. Comics tend to explore darker, more introspective themes and multiple timelines, which might not translate perfectly to films due to budget or rating constraints.\\n\\nTo help you decide if the movies capture the comics\\' essence, consider starting with Nolan\\'s trilogy if you want a closer adaptation of the gritty comic style, or the 1989 \"Batman\" for a fun, visual contrast. If you\\'re looking at accuracy, comics like \"The Dark Knight Returns\" offer a raw, dystopian edge that films sometimes tone down. Would you like recommendations on specific comics to compare with a movie, or details on how a particular character evolves across media? This can guide your enjoyment or discussions further.',\n",

A follow up to Man of Steel , the film features Ben Affleck as Batman and intended to launch a shared universe that would last indefinitely. Batman v. Superman follows Batman and Superman as they are brought into conflict by criminal mastermind Lex Luthor .

Affleck reprises his role as Batman from Batman v. Superman and Suicide Squad . The film follows him teaming up with Wonder Woman , the Flash , Aquaman and Cyborg to fight Steppenwolf and the forces of Apokolips, after the apparent death of Superman.

Robbie, Davis and Kinnaman will return as Quinn, Waller and Flag, respectively. The film will also feature several other Batman villains, including Polka-Dot Man and the Ratcatcher . The Flash Andy Muschietti will direct a Flash movie centering on Ezra Miller that will introduce the concept of a cinematic \"Multiverse.\" A retcon that would unite previous incarnations of the Batman film franchise. Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck will return as their versions of the character. Producer Barbara Muschietti promised that film would \"change everything, but doesn\\'t forget anything\" at the DC FanDome . Walter Hamada intends the film as way of refreshing their approach and correct the mistakes of the recent past. Villain Spinoff Films Catwoman Catwoman was released on July 23, 2004 and stars Halle Berry as Patience Phillips , where this version of Catwoman is a a shy, timid artist that gained cat like powers. Auteur French filmmaker Pitof directed the standalone movie. The film was panned by critics and was a box office bomb only grossing $82 million. The film intended to link itself to the previous series by placing a photo of Michelle Pfeiffer in a scene suggesting that all previous live-action depictions exist within the same reality. This was before legal issues regarding the television show were sorted in 2013, so no photos from the live-action series could be used by WB. Joker Joker was released on October 4, 2019 and was directed by Todd Phillips. Joaquin Phoenix stars as Arthur Fleck , a struggling comedian suffering with his mental health. The film is set in an 1980s Gotham City and tells a possible origin story for the Joker. The film was overwhelmingly financially successful and received positively, many praising Phoenix\\'s performance and willingness to move away from the comics. However, some social commenters were concerned it may inspire real-world violence. Phoenix won an Oscar for the film which makes him the second actor to win an Oscar after Ledger in The Dark Knight and the fourth Joker actor to win an Oscar.', 'Doug Moench General Information Birth Date: February 23, 1948 Birth Place: Chicago, Illinois USA Doug Moench is an American writer.

Contents 1 Sypnosis 2 Issues 3 Publication history 4 Influence 4.1 Comics 4.2 Film 4.3 Animation 4.4 Television 4.5 Video Games Sypnosis The Dark Knight is set in a dystopian near-future version of Gotham City . The year is never specified, though it has been a full decade since the last reported sighting of Batman. Society has lost faith in the functioning of justice, and the current American President, named only Dickard , and whose appearance seems to be a reference to Ronald Reagan, constantly tries to keep the social order with optimistic discourses, while the Cold War is still ongoing. Virtually all superheroes, with the exception of Superman , have been forced by governmental authorities into retirement or otherwise driven away by a distrusting populace. Bruce Wayne has voluntarily retired from crime fighting following the death (under unspecified circumstances) of Jason Todd , the second Robin . In the absence of superheroes, criminals run amok, and a gang called the Mutants terrorize Gotham City. The return of an old enemy prompts a now 55-year-old Wayne to don the Batman costume once again. Despite Wayne\\'s funding his rehabilitation, including plastic surgery to restore his half-disfigured face, Harvey \" Two-Face \" Dent has seemingly returned to crime. Batman apprehends Dent, but the populace debates whether Batman\\'s brand of vigilantism has any place in society. The media plays a large role in DKR , with the narrative broken up by news reports and \"talking head\" editorials debating events in the story as they unfold. After Batman saves her from a Mutant attack, 13-year-old Carrie Kelly buys herself a knock-off Robin costume, and searches for Batman to aid him. She finds Batman at the city dump, where he is fighting the Mutants. The Mutants\\' leader defeats Batman in combat, but Kelly distracts him and pulls Batman into the tank-like Batmobile . Kelly attends to Batman’s wounds as the vehicle drives toward the Batcave . Once home, Batman takes Carrie on as the new Robin despite his butler Alfred\\'s objections. With the help of retiring Commissioner James Gordon , the Mutants\\' leader is allowed to escape from jail, and Batman beats him in a mud fight in front of the assembled gang, which then disbands as a result of his humiliation. Some former Mutants create a new gang, the \"Sons of the Batman,\" using extremely violent methods (up to and including murder) to \"purge\" Gotham of its criminal element in what they see as emulation of Batman\\'s actions. Meanwhile, the return of Batman has caused one of his oldest and deadliest foes, The Joker , to awaken from a years-long catatonic state at Arkham Asylum . The Joker convinces his psychiatrist, Dr. Bartholomew Wolper, that he is sane and regrets his misdeeds. Seeking to discredit Batman, whom he has crusaded against in the media, Wolper appears with the Joker on a late-night show. While the police, now led by the anti-vigilante Commissioner Ellen Yindel , attack Batman, the Joker murders everyone in the television studio (including Wolper) and escapes. Batman and Robin track the Joker to a county fair, where Batman defeats Joker in a violent showdown. Batman stops short of killing the Joker; however, the Joker finishes the job himself, twisting his own broken neck, with the intent that the police will charge Batman with murder. Batman escapes, but not before another confrontation with the Gotham police, and a citywide manhunt is now on for the Caped Crusader. After Superman diverts a Russian nuclear warhead which then detonates in a desert, millions of tons of dust and debris fill the atmosphere, and Gotham descends into chaos during the resulting blackout. Batman and Robin train former Mutants and the brutal Sons of the Batman in non-lethal fighting to stop looting and ensure the flow of needed supplies. In the midst of nuclear winter conditions, Gotham becomes the safest city in America; the U.S. government, seeing this as a credibility-undermining embarrassment, orders Superman to take Batman down. Having been warned of the government\\'s plans by Oliver Queen, the former Green Arrow, Batman confronts Superman. Symbolically, their duel takes place in Crime Alley , where Bruce Wayne\\'s parents were murdered decades earlier. Batman defeats Superman in a well planned fight, but dies from a heart attack immediately afterward. After his funeral, it is revealed that his death was staged as an elaborate ruse; Clark Kent attends the funeral and gives Robin a knowing wink after hearing Bruce\\'s heartbeat as he leaves the grave site, suggesting his silent approval of what will happen next. Alfred destroys the Batcave and Wayne Manor and suffers a fatal stroke. Some time afterward, Batman leads Robin, Green Arrow, and the rest of his followers into the caverns beyond the Batcave and prepares to continue his fight. His plan, which will take years of training and studying, is to build an army, and to bring sense to a world plagued by something \"worse than thieves and murderers\". He decides that this will be a good life — good enough. Issues The Dark Knight Returns The Dark Knight Triumphant Hunt the Dark Knight The Dark Knight Falls Publication history The original indicia of each issue states that the series was titled Batman: The Dark Knight . Several early collected editions also left out the words Returns from the cover title. Influence Comics Batman: The Dark Knight is often heralded as one of the biggest influences on the Modern Age of Comic Books , alongside Alan Moore \\'s Watchmen . The series notably revitalized interest in Batman, which had been waning since the 1970s. Although not the first Batman work to implement a darker tone, the series helped popularize grimmer takes on the character and move away from light-hearted approaches, which were heavily associated with him due to the popularity of the 1960s series . Elements of Batman\\'s costumes, specifically short ears on the cowl and pouch-based Utility Belt , would be adapted into other variations and artists\\' designs. The evaluation of the character\\'s psychology would be in other works, including Grant Morrison \\'s Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth . Original characters from the series, such as Carrie Kelley and the Mutants , have also appeared in the main-continuities and other depictions. Several art pieces from the series, notably Batman crouching on a line , have appeared throughout the franchise and promotional work. Plot points from the series would also make it into DC\\'s New Earth and Prime Earth, notably the death of Jason Todd . Several moments of Batman\\'s origin, notably discovering the Batcave as a child and the pearls falling from his mother\\'s neck, also originate from the series. The Exoframe Batsuit used in the battle with Superman has also inspired other armors used by Batman to fight superpowered enemies, such as the Thrasher Suit and Justice Buster Batsuit . Elements of the story have also appeared in works related to Superman and Green Arrow . Film Tim Burton , director of the 1989 Batman film and Batman Returns , cited Batman: The Dark Knight as great influence on his works with the character. Joel Schumacher had also pitched a live-action adaptation of the series to Warner Bros. after finishing Batman Forever and the later cancelation of Batman Unchained . However, both times had the proposal shelved in favor of both Batman & Robin and Batman: DarKnight , respectively. Christopher Nolan \\'s would take several influences from Miller\\'s Batman: The Dark Knight . The most consistent over the films including the Tumbler (the films\\' version of the Batmobile ) being a large military vehicle intended for warfare like the Riot Tank Batmobile used in the comic. The second film, The Dark Knight , also features a group of vigilante copycats similar to the Sons of Batman . The third film in the trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises , takes the most influence from the series and even lifts several plotlines. The most notable include a retired Batman returning to fight crime after years of absence, the GCPD learning of it when he intervenes in a car chase, his confrontations with Bane mirroring both fights with the Mutant Leader , and Bruce Wayne faking his death to find a life away from the cowl. Batman also uses a Mechanized Leg Brace to enhance his strength, having lost much of it over years of retirement. The 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice also took heavy influence from The Dark Knight comic series, even featuring many visual and dialogue references to the series. The film\\'s depiction of Batman also takes influence from the series\\' version, including the character being at middle-age, wearing a similar Batsuit design , and being depicted as more brutal and willing to use lethal force. The film also takes pieces of dialogue and moments are directly lifted from the series, most notably Alfred \\'s concerns about the lack of future Wayne generations, Superman being weakened by a nuclear weapon\\'s detonation, and the hostage situation from The Dark Knight Triumphant (though the film switches the toddler with Martha Kent and shows a decisively lethal outcome for the captor). The fight with Superman also takes many elements of the climax, such as Batman using an heavily-armored Batsuit , using ultra-sonic weaponry to cause a sensory overload, and using Kryptonite gas to weaken his opponent. The 2019 film Joker also lifts the talk-show scene from the comic, with its host Murray Franklin being based on David Endocrine . The Riot Tank Batmobile also appears in new material filmed for scene for the director\\'s cut of Justice League , appearing in the \"Knightmare\" post-credits scene. Animation The New Batman Adventures would adapt the second issue ( The Dark Knight Triumphant ) as a segment in the episode \" Legends of the Dark Knight \". However, the story was heavily condensed and the segment removes several moments to retain a family audience, such as Batman shooting a member of the mutants and the initial encounter with the Mutant Leader. In The Batman animated series episode \" Artifacts \", a future version of the series\\' Batman bares a muscular similar to the comic\\'s version, such as the muscular design, larger bat-symbol and use of strength-enhancing technology. The Batman: The Brave and the Bold also pays homage to The Dark Knight Returns in the episode \" The Rise of the Blue Beetle! \", with the cover appearing as a poster on Jamie Reyes\\' bedroom wall. The entire series was adapted into an animated feature directed by Jay Oliva and released in two parts from September, 2012 to January, 2013. A combination of the two was released on October 2013. Television In the TV series Gotham , the episode \" The Gentle Art of Making Enemies \" has a confrontation between Bruce Wayne and Jerome Valeska (the series\\' first incarnation of the Joker) take place in a Hall of Mirrors. The comic\\'s depiction of the Joker was also used as influence for Jerome\\'s brother Jeremiah Valeska , such as him being render catatonic and returning after Bruce\\'s return ten years later. The Arrowverse also features a version of Batman based on the comic\\'s version of the character, with references to antagonism with Superman and dialogue lifted straight from the series\\' climax. Video Games The video game Batman: Arkham Knight features a version of the Batmobile that can turn into a riot-response tank similar to the series\\' version of the vehicle. The game implies the design was chosen due to something darker taking control of his psyche and influencing him to implement these. However, the riot-tank features of the Batmobile are decisively non-lethal, whereas the comic\\'s is implied to be capable of deadly force but never used.', 'The Dark Knight General Information Type: Limited Series Total Issues: 4 Published: February – June 1986 Creators: Frank Miller Lynn Varley Batman: The Dark Knight is a four issue mini-series written and drawn by acclaimed author Frank Miller , first published by DC Comics in 1986. Over time the storyarc has been retitled by DC as The Dark Knight Returns in modern trade paperbacks. Contents 1 Sypnosis 2 Issues 3 Publication history 4 Influence 4.1 Comics 4.2 Film 4.3 Animation 4.4 Television 4.5 Video Games Sypnosis The Dark Knight is set in a dystopian near-future version of Gotham City . The year is never specified, though it has been a full decade since the last reported sighting of Batman. Society has lost faith in the functioning of justice, and the current American President, named only Dickard , and whose appearance seems to be a reference to Ronald Reagan, constantly tries to keep the social order with optimistic discourses, while the Cold War is still ongoing. Virtually all superheroes, with the exception of Superman , have been forced by governmental authorities into retirement or otherwise driven away by a distrusting populace. Bruce Wayne has voluntarily retired from crime fighting following the death (under unspecified circumstances) of Jason Todd , the second Robin . In the absence of superheroes, criminals run amok, and a gang called the Mutants terrorize Gotham City. The return of an old enemy prompts a now 55-year-old Wayne to don the Batman costume once again. Despite Wayne\\'s funding his rehabilitation, including plastic surgery to restore his half-disfigured face, Harvey \" Two-Face \" Dent has seemingly returned to crime. Batman apprehends Dent, but the populace debates whether Batman\\'s brand of vigilantism has any place in society. The media plays a large role in DKR , with the narrative broken up by news reports and \"talking head\" editorials debating events in the story as they unfold. After Batman saves her from a Mutant attack, 13-year-old Carrie Kelly buys herself a knock-off Robin costume, and searches for Batman to aid him. She finds Batman at the city dump, where he is fighting the Mutants. The Mutants\\' leader defeats Batman in combat, but Kelly distracts him and pulls Batman into the tank-like Batmobile . Kelly attends to Batman’s wounds as the vehicle drives toward the Batcave . Once home, Batman takes Carrie on as the new Robin despite his butler Alfred\\'s objections. With the help of retiring Commissioner James Gordon , the Mutants\\' leader is allowed to escape from jail, and Batman beats him in a mud fight in front of the assembled gang, which then disbands as a result of his humiliation. Some former Mutants create a new gang, the \"Sons of the Batman,\" using extremely violent methods (up to and including murder) to \"purge\" Gotham of its criminal element in what they see as emulation of Batman\\'s actions. Meanwhile, the return of Batman has caused one of his oldest and deadliest foes, The Joker , to awaken from a years-long catatonic state at Arkham Asylum . The Joker convinces his psychiatrist, Dr. Bartholomew Wolper, that he is sane and regrets his misdeeds. Seeking to discredit Batman, whom he has crusaded against in the media, Wolper appears with the Joker on a late-night show. While the police, now led by the anti-vigilante Commissioner Ellen Yindel , attack Batman, the Joker murders everyone in the television studio (including Wolper) and escapes. Batman and Robin track the Joker to a county fair, where Batman defeats Joker in a violent showdown. Batman stops short of killing the Joker; however, the Joker finishes the job himself, twisting his own broken neck, with the intent that the police will charge Batman with murder. Batman escapes, but not before another confrontation with the Gotham police, and a citywide manhunt is now on for the Caped Crusader.

      "    response='Yes, Batman comics and movies share many core similarities, but there are also notable differences in how storylines, characters, and themes are adapted, which can affect how faithfully the essence of the comics is captured. For instance, both mediums feature Batman\\'s origin as Bruce Wayne, his fight against villains like the Joker and Two-Face, and themes of justice, vigilantism, and moral ambiguity. Comics like Frank Miller\\'s \"The Dark Knight\" have directly influenced movies, such as Christopher Nolan\\'s trilogy (e.g., \"The Dark Knight Rises\" borrows elements like Batman\\'s retirement and return, as well as his confrontations with foes). However, movies often simplify complex comic storylines for runtime and audience appeal, resulting in a more action-oriented or visually spectacular take—Nolan\\'s films emphasize realism and psychological depth, while earlier ones like Tim Burton\\'s are more gothic and stylized. Comics tend to explore darker, more introspective themes and multiple timelines, which might not translate perfectly to films due to budget or rating constraints.\\n\\nTo help you decide if the movies capture the comics\\' essence, consider starting with Nolan\\'s trilogy if you want a closer adaptation of the gritty comic style, or the 1989 \"Batman\" for a fun, visual contrast. If you\\'re looking at accuracy, comics like \"The Dark Knight Returns\" offer a raw, dystopian edge that films sometimes tone down. Would you like recommendations on specific comics to compare with a movie, or details on how a particular character evolves across media? This can guide your enjoyment or discussions further.'\n",

He is a founding member of the Justice League .

As the Waynes\\' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father\\'s business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler, Alfred Pennyworth , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents\\' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City. As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named Ethan Bennett . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\". As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents\\' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot. For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman\\'s activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police Angel Rojas took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named Ellen Yin , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham. In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date – the Joker . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes. The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham\\'s underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named Bane . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of the Penguin , Man-Bat , Killer Croc , Cluemaster and Catwoman . One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce\\'s career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface. Some time later, a new character entered the Batman\\'s life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally. Barbara Gordon , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordan , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend Poison Ivy from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara\\'s aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt. The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist Dick Grayson was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named Tony Zucco . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick\\'s acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force. Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself John Jones . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called the Joining . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth\\'s atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John\\'s behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as Lex Luthor . At some point later, in the year 2027, Mr. Freeze had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named Nightwing . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever. One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave\\'s titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman\\'s legacy survived into the future.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced.

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running.

He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations.

He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History.

Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber.

Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition.

This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons.

Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate . His primary form of combat is a harmonious mixture of Jui-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Judo, Muay Thai, Savate, Karate, Kung Fu, Boxing, Capoeira, Krav Maga, Aikido, and Ninjutsu. Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21. He has mastered Diverse Environmental Training, Security Systems, and illusion/sleight of hand by the time he was 23. He gained even more degrees in Biology, Physics, Advanced Chemistry, and Technology by the time he was 25. He has learned Forensic, Medical Sciences, Expanded Computer and Engineering Sciences, and Expanded Device Pool use of personal powered armor and system, database creation on underworld crime bosses, rogue\\'s gallery foes and other supers; improved material sciences for body armor and micro-machinery by the time he was 26. Has also learned Advanced New Development in Forensic and Medical Sciences. Master Tactician : He is a master strategist and tactician commonly utilizes extremely cunning tactics, strategies, and protocols to outwit his foes. He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture. Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate . His primary form of combat is a harmonious mixture of Jui-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Judo, Muay Thai, Savate, Karate, Kung Fu, Boxing, Capoeira, Krav Maga, Aikido, and Ninjutsu. Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21. He has mastered Diverse Environmental Training, Security Systems, and illusion/sleight of hand by the time he was 23. He gained even more degrees in Biology, Physics, Advanced Chemistry, and Technology by the time he was 25. He has learned Forensic, Medical Sciences, Expanded Computer and Engineering Sciences, and Expanded Device Pool use of personal powered armor and system, database creation on underworld crime bosses, rogue\\'s gallery foes and other supers; improved material sciences for body armor and micro-machinery by the time he was 26. Has also learned Advanced New Development in Forensic and Medical Sciences. Master Tactician : He is a master strategist and tactician commonly utilizes extremely cunning tactics, strategies, and protocols to outwit his foes. He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture. Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman is the secret identity of billionaire Bruce Wayne , the CEO of Wayne Enterprises, who, after witnessing the death of his parents, vowed to spend the rest of his life warring on all criminals. He is a founding member of the Justice League . Contents 1 History 2 Appearance 3 Powers and Abilities 4 Paraphernalia 4.1 Equipment 4.2 Transportation 4.3 Weapons 4.4 Batsuits 5 Appearances 6 Trivia 7 Voiced by History Bruce Wayne was born a child of wealth and privilege to Thomas and Martha Wayne of Gotham City. As the Waynes\\' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father\\'s business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler, Alfred Pennyworth , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents\\' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City. As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named Ethan Bennett . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\". As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents\\' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot. For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman\\'s activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police Angel Rojas took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named Ellen Yin , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham. In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date – the Joker . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes. The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham\\'s underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named Bane . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of the Penguin , Man-Bat , Killer Croc , Cluemaster and Catwoman . One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce\\'s career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface. Some time later, a new character entered the Batman\\'s life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally. Barbara Gordon , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordan , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend Poison Ivy from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara\\'s aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt. The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist Dick Grayson was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named Tony Zucco . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick\\'s acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force. Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself John Jones . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called the Joining . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth\\'s atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John\\'s behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as Lex Luthor . At some point later, in the year 2027, Mr. Freeze had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named Nightwing . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever. One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave\\'s titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman\\'s legacy survived into the future.

His personal favourite was the Gray Ghost , watching the television show with his father. On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to Wonder Woman , Bruce hadn\\'t been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes\\' faithful friend and butler, Alfred Pennyworth Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from Yoru Sensei . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor\\'s daughter Zatanna became very close. As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with Andrea Beaumont . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\". War on Crime Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the Batcave . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city\\'s underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in Dick Grayson as his ward after witnessing his parents\\' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down their murderer . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and Commissioner James Gordon , working with them to control crime in Gotham. Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included the Penguin , Poison Ivy , Mr. Freeze and the Scarecrow . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including Catwoman and Two-Face . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered the Joker , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created. New Adventures Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as Batwoman . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called Batgirl began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father\\'s legacy as the next Police Commissioner. Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned Tim Drake from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder. Joining Up For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called Blüdhaven . Batman would later find himself in Metropolis , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with Lex Luthor , Batman would find himself working with Superman to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker\\'s plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue\\'s gallery. He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another\\'s home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity. Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper. It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world\\'s greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League. Saving the World Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech\\'s deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station\\'s antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J\\'onn J\\'onzz\\' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna\\'s destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch. Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman\\'s mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don\\'t even think about it\". When the Imperium\\'s attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation. Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J\\'onn J\\'onzz. After freeing J\\'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J\\'onn J\\'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of Wonder Woman . The Flash arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing\\'s severed wing. After J\\'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium\\'s invasion of Mars , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium\\'s factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun\\'s rays. The heroes split up to disable the factories. Batman went to Giza, Egypt with Wonder Woman and J\\'onn J\\'onzz. The trio infiltrated the factory and found the Ion Matrix Crystal, a vital component of the plant. Batman and Wonder Woman provided a diversion to allow J\\'onzz to remove the crystal. As he removed the crystal, J\\'onzz was incapacitated by Imperium forces. Batman then covered Wonder Woman and J\\'onzz\\' escape from the plant, but was himself trapped inside and cornered by Imperium forces. J\\'onzz reported that Batman was dead, but in truth, he had mentally shielded Batman to prevent the Imperium forces from detecting him. Batman remained hidden until the Imperium arrived on Earth. He then revealed himself and reversed the ion charge in the Ion Matrix Crystal, causing the plant to burn off the smoke it had been producing. With the sun shining again, the heroes defeated the Imperium and freed their human prisoners, then mopped up the remaining Imperium forces around the globe. Inspired by a general\\'s speech about vigilance and the possible return of the invaders, Batman had the Watchtower constructed by Wayne Enterprises, hiding the funding as a \"line item in the aerospace R&D budget\". Batman invited the other six heroes who had repelled the invaders to the station. The seven heroes formed the Justice League. Claiming he wasn\\'t a \"people person\", Batman did not officially join the League, though he did offer to be on call when the League needed his help. Long considered the brains of the League, Batman often found solutions that eluded the other members. He was quick to place himself in danger, despite the awe-inspiring powers of his teammates. During the Atlantis Usurpation, Batman put a stop to the melting of the Polar Ice Caps. On another occasion, Batman single-handedly defeated five dangerous criminals before being taken prisoner by an Amazon trained criminal. During his time with the League, Batman showed his distrust of Superman. After Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid and when Batman had to pull Superman back later when he attempted to end Darkseid\\'s life, Batman began carrying a piece of Kryptonite, which was revealed when the android Amazo copied Superman\\'s powers. However, Batman still held a deep respect for the Man of Steel, especially after he had seemingly died at the hands of Toyman. But, regardless of his respect, Batman remained stubborn in his disbelief in Superman\\'s death, and refused to mourn for him for quite a while. During the Thanagarian Invasion of Earth, Batman was forced to reveal his identity to his teammates. After successfully retaking the Watchtower from Thanagarian Forces, Batman piloted the Watchtower through the Earth\\'s atmosphere in an attempt to plunge it into a Hyperspace Bypass, a city-wide machine that would generate a wormhole through the Earth. As Batman lost consciousness due to the heat surrounding him, Superman rescued him and as the Watchtower destroyed the Bypass Generator. With the Watchtower\\'s destruction and Hawkgirl \\'s resignation from the League, Batman and the five other members reformed the Justice League with a new Watchtower and an expanded roster of heroes. Batman was instrumental in recruiting Green Arrow into the League, who along with other human league members, helped keep the League from becoming an autonomous Metahuman army. With Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, Batman fought Chronos across time, an adventure during which he met another Batman as well as his older self. He also succeeded in demonstrating to Amanda Waller that Cadmus was being used as a tool to further Lex Luthor\\'s personal agenda to discredit and destroy the Justice League. Amanda Waller was so impressed with Batman that she created Project Batman Beyond to ensure that the world would always have a Batman. Joker\\'s Final Joke After these events, Robin went missing for three weeks while on patrol, with Batman and Batgirl searching for him, until they learned he was at Arkham Asylum . They encounter Joker and Harley Quinn , who reveal that they adopted a son named J.J.(Joker, Jr.), who was actually Robin brainwashed and driven insane. Joker seems to escape, with Batman hot in pursuit. However, he was actually trying to lure Batman into Arkham\\'s Cineplex, where he reveals that he subjected Robin to countless amounts of psychological and physical tortures, and because of this, Joker now knows Batman\\'s true identity, and everything about him. Batman, enraged at the cruelty and torture Joker inflicted onto Robin, smashes through the theater box, and beats Joker down (wrecking the projector in the process, causing Joker to say \"If you don\\'t like the movie, I\\'ve got slides!\"), then hurls Joker down to the room that J.J.\\'s in. Batman threatens to break Joker in half, causing the Joker to retort that he would have done it years ago if he really wanted to do it. Suddenly, The Joker draws a switchblade, and slices Batman\\'s chest, as well as stabs his leg. He then gives what looks like a gun to J.J. and tells him to kill Batman (or, in his words, \"deliver the punchline.\"). J.J. then pulls the trigger, revealing the gun to actually be the infamous \"Bang!\" flag spear gun that is one of the Joker\\'s trademark weapons. J.J. apparently hesitates to kill Batman, causing the Joker to shout \"DO IT!\". Tim reluctantly obliges. Instead of killing Batman however, he instead turns it away at the last second, thus shooting the Joker instead, killing him. J.J. half laughs and half sobs at the events, and Batgirl (having arrived after her fight with Harley Quinn) tries to console him. Commissioner Gordon and Batman later bury the body of Joker in the ruins of Arkham, and Tim is taken to Doctor Leslie Thompkins for rehabilitation. After these events, Batman forbade Tim Drake from ever becoming Robin again. Tim attempted to go solo for a few years, but in the end quit the super-hero life, got married and had children. He broke off contact with Bruce but remained close with Barbara and perhaps Dick. Also, as a result of the fight, Batman walked with a slight limp which in his later years would force him to walk with a cane. Late Adventures Many years passed following the attack of the Joker on the Bat-Family, Bruce entered middle age and began to suffer with a bad heart from the effects of a hard life of crime fighting. Batman developed a powered high tech suit (which had longer Bat ears and minus a cape) that augmented his physical abilities and allowed him to continue the never-ending battle for a few more years. At this time, his corporate rivalry with Derek Powers began, and Wayne Enterprises resisted a hostile bid for corporate takeover. However, injuries suffered through the long decades of physical punishment and an ailing heart finally took their toll, and even the suit couldn\\'t compensate any longer. While attempting to rescue his old friend Veronica Vreeland\\'s daughter Bunny Vreeland from kidnappers, Batman managed to subdue the kidnappers with limited effort until he was forced to point a gun at a common thug to save Ms. Vreeland and his own life after suffering a heart attack while in the midst of the fight. Injured, Batman limps outside the hangar, removing his mask upon realizing he was wielding a handgun, forced to rely on the weapon of his parents\\' cowardly murderer to defend himself against criminals. Ashamed, Bruce returns to the Batcave, where he places the Batsuit in the costume display gallery. Walking to the top of the stairs, Bruce takes one last look at the Batcave and solemnly vows, \"Never again.\" Vowing to never again wear the cowl, Bruce then shuts off the lights, and leaves his past in the darkness. Passing the Mantle of the Bat When he hung up the mantle of the bat, Bruce came a recluse, shut off in Wayne Manor with his dog, Ace. He withdrew from the day to day operations of Wayne Enterprises, a decision that left the company vulnerable to a takeover by Derek Powers and caused Wayne much regret. It was now the year 2039 and Bruce Wayne had become a very old man. Chance brought teen-aged Terry McGinnis to the gates of Wayne Manor, where he learned of Bruce\\'s past secret life. After McGinnis suffered the loss of his father, Bruce reluctantly agreed to allow him to take up mantle of Batman. Bruce then served as a mentor and informant for the successor to his legacy. For years, Bruce coordinated with Terry, supplying advice and direction from the Batcave while McGinnis worked in the field. He also ran the labs and developed new gadgets for Terry to use in the new crusade against crime. The elderly Bruce Wayne occasionally ventured into the field to support Terry. His sense of duty and self-sacrifice ever present, he once donned a suit of Batman armor to rescue Terry from the villain Inque, despite Inque\\'s Metahuman power and the strain produced on Bruce\\'s already damaged heart. As Bruce continued to age, he suffered a kidney failure. When it was discovered that Terry was not just a suitable donor but a perfect one, their relationship reached its weakest point; Terry, like Dick Grayson before him, felt betrayed, manipulated, and outright used. He set off to uncover the truth from someone willing to reveal it. Terry confronted Amanda Waller and learned the truth about his heritage. In her earlier years, Waller realized the world would always need a Batman. Taking fate into her own hands (unbeknownst to Bruce), she gathered a sample of Bruce Wayne\\'s genetic material, after a battle that left Batman in need of medical attention. Using her Cadmus connections, Waller implanted this genetic material into a young Warren McGinnis, replacing his genetic material with Bruce\\'s. Thus, Terry McGinnis was born, the son of Bruce Wayne, sharing half his genetic code. Terry returned to Wayne Manor with a new sense of purpose. Bruce wondered about the fate of Gotham, and Terry replied \"I\\'ve got it covered. Always.\" Their relationship repaired; Bruce had truly become the father Terry had lost long ago. The Savage Timeline In an alternate timeline created by Vandal Savage, the Axis forces won World War II. There, Bruce Wayne lost his parents when they spoke out against the regime and became Batman to fight Savage and his forces. He served as the leader of the resistance movement, recruiting other victims. Unlike his original self, Batman was willing to use guns without a second thought. When the Justice League from the original timeline arrived, Batman helped them escape from the authorities and learned of our timeline. He assisted them in breaking into the facility where the time portal was kept. However, Batman did not accompany the League into the past to thwart Savage, preferring to stay behind and lead the resistance in case they failed. It is assumed that this reality ceased to exist when the League defeated Savage and counteract the Axis powers\\' artificial advantages. Powers and Abilities Through his years of intensive physical training, the Batman represents the peak of human physical conditioning. Batman is at peak human levels of strength, stamina, agility, coordination, reflexes, speed, and durability. Even well into old age, Bruce Wayne still demonstrated that he could manhandle other much younger men with ease. Batman\\'s martial arts discipline was never mentioned, in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Bruce Wayne mentions Ju Jitsu. Batman was also a master of stealth and infiltration (all the more remarkable given that he stands 6\\'2\" and weighs 215 lbs), and often revealed himself to his enemies when they least suspected him to. This also allowed him to just disappear from allies in mid-sentence, a habit that frequently annoyed the likes of Commissioner Gordon (\"one of these days I\\'m gonna nail his feet to the ground\") and Harvey Bullock (\"I wonder how the Commish puts up with that\"). Batman was capable of incredible feats of agility. During the Second Apokolyptian invasion, Darkseid commented with much surprise that Batman had been the first one to dodge his Omega Beams. With his martial arts prowess, occasionally augmented by technology, Batman was usually more than a match for any foe he encountered, human or otherwise. Equipment As the head of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce Wayne has access to cutting edge technology and Batman makes good use of it in his field equipment. Batsuit-standard as well as heat-resistant, cold-resistant, and underwater versions. Batarangs-of differing size and effect. These ranged from standard, to explosive, electric, remote, etc. Grapple-gun. This item assisted Batman in scaling the various buildings of Gotham City. Utility Belt - Batman\\'s Utility Belt has compartments to hold several items, the contents of which change according to his needs, and often include items such as flashlights, laser cutters, underwater rebreathers, binoculars, a fingerprinting kit, flashbangs, remote controls for his vehicles, acid/base compounds, anti-toxins, mini-computer, and smoke pellets. Vehicles Batman has used several vehicles in the course of his crimefighting career, including: Batmobile Batwing Batcycle Batboat Appearances Batman: The Animated Series Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero The New Batman Adventures Superman: The Animated Series Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Batman Beyond Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Justice League Justice League Unlimited Static Shock', 'Batman General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bob Kane Bill Finger Affiliations: Batman Family Justice Society of America Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Martial arts master Access to high tech equipment Batman was the sworn protector of Gotham City on Earth-Two. Contents 1 History 1.1 DCnU 2 Behind the scenes 3 In other media 4 See Also History Although as a young boy Bruce Wayne lost his parents to a gun-wielding robber , as his vigilante alter-ego Batman, he took firearms into his war on crime. The Batman of Earth-Two did not have the same \"no-guns\" policy as his Earth-One counterpart. He often wore a holster on his utility belt that carried his pistol and had a machine gun mounted on the Batplane. Batman had to rescue his girlfriend Julie Madison from the vampires The Monk and Dala . When he found them resting in their coffins he shot them both dead with silver bullets. After tracking down Dr. Hugo Strange and his mutated men, Batman opened fire on the disfigured humans from the Batplane . On several other occasions, the gun on his utility belt was clearly visible. Considered a vigilante by the police because he killed many of his early opponents, Wayne as Batman proved to be effective against the open acting crime organizations that the ineffective Gotham City police force could not. Batman began gathering the grudging admiration of then Police Commissioner James Gordon in his efforts, despite Batman\\'s lethal methods of crime combating operations. The Caped Crusader joined the Justice Society of America to unite heroes against the threat of Nazi Germany during World War II. Batman later married his former foe Catwoman and became the father of Huntress (Helena Wayne) . DCnU Bruce Wayne was a man of many options, suited for almost any task he was forced to make hard decisions during the end of the world. Prior to the Apokolips War Bruce Wayne fought crime as Batman and eventually fell in love with former villain Selina Kyle who went by the alias Catwoman. The two got married and eventually had a daughter that they named Helena Wayne . Bruce originally did not want his daughter to become involved in his hero life believing it would endanger her, but ended up letting her be Robin after Selina died and when the Apokolips War began. When Steppenwolf brought the Parademons to Metropolis and across the world with boom tubes he wasted no time destroying Gotham City as well. On his last day, Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman devised a plan to destroy the remaining towers erected by Steppenwolf. Batman died after giving his last words to his daughter as the virus he planted caused the tower he was in to explode. Behind the scenes Batman in earlier comics also frequently killed villains and thugs by punching or kicking them into vats of acid, or off roofs. In other media In Batman , Bruce Wayne was similar to the gun-toting Batman of Earth-Two. He opened fire on the Joker with the Batwing . Presumably an attempt to shoot Joker with the Batwing\\'s guns and rockets, but missed hitting a few Goons . Over the course of the film series, he killed a handful of other minor character amidst collateral damage or fighting at the top of the cathedral. Notable exceptions in the sequels included the brutal executions of the circus strongman and Two-Face . In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice , Batman is even more casually murderous, using vehicular mounted weaponry. See Also Batman (Earth-2)/Gallery Batman Batman (Disambiguation)'],\n",

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate . His primary form of combat is a harmonious mixture of Jui-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Judo, Muay Thai, Savate, Karate, Kung Fu, Boxing, Capoeira, Krav Maga, Aikido, and Ninjutsu. Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21. He has mastered Diverse Environmental Training, Security Systems, and illusion/sleight of hand by the time he was 23. He gained even more degrees in Biology, Physics, Advanced Chemistry, and Technology by the time he was 25. He has learned Forensic, Medical Sciences, Expanded Computer and Engineering Sciences, and Expanded Device Pool use of personal powered armor and system, database creation on underworld crime bosses, rogue\\'s gallery foes and other supers; improved material sciences for body armor and micro-machinery by the time he was 26. Has also learned Advanced New Development in Forensic and Medical Sciences. Master Tactician : He is a master strategist and tactician commonly utilizes extremely cunning tactics, strategies, and protocols to outwit his foes. He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture. Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate . His primary form of combat is a harmonious mixture of Jui-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Judo, Muay Thai, Savate, Karate, Kung Fu, Boxing, Capoeira, Krav Maga, Aikido, and Ninjutsu. Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21. He has mastered Diverse Environmental Training, Security Systems, and illusion/sleight of hand by the time he was 23. He gained even more degrees in Biology, Physics, Advanced Chemistry, and Technology by the time he was 25. He has learned Forensic, Medical Sciences, Expanded Computer and Engineering Sciences, and Expanded Device Pool use of personal powered armor and system, database creation on underworld crime bosses, rogue\\'s gallery foes and other supers; improved material sciences for body armor and micro-machinery by the time he was 26. Has also learned Advanced New Development in Forensic and Medical Sciences. Master Tactician : He is a master strategist and tactician commonly utilizes extremely cunning tactics, strategies, and protocols to outwit his foes. He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture. Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced.

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations.

He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them.

He has learned Forensic, Medical Sciences, Expanded Computer and Engineering Sciences, and Expanded Device Pool use of personal powered armor and system, database creation on underworld crime bosses, rogue\\'s gallery foes and other supers; improved material sciences for body armor and micro-machinery by the time he was 26. Has also learned Advanced New Development in Forensic and Medical Sciences. Master Tactician : He is a master strategist and tactician commonly utilizes extremely cunning tactics, strategies, and protocols to outwit his foes. He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture. Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

The two operated as superheroes under the aliases of Gotham and Gotham Girl . After Hank\\'s death, Claire joined the Batman family, though she fell under the influence of the Psycho Pirate and Bane . Contents 1 Biography 1.1 Debut in Gotham 1.2 Under Psycho Pirate\\'s Control 2 Powers and Abilities Biography Like her brother, Claire Clover was a fan of Batman, after her family were saved from a mugging by the vigilante. Hoping to help him in return for his deeds, the two bought experimental treatment that granted them similar powers to Superman . However, whilst using them, they would draw off their life span, meaning they could only live for two years with similar powers as the man of steel or an hour with the powers of a god. After undergoing the therapy, they began operating as superheroes under the aliases of \"Gotham\" and \"Gotham Girl\". Debut in Gotham Claire first met Batman when she and Hank, as their superhero identities, saved both him and a plane from crashing into the Gotham bay. Taken under the wing by the Dark Knight, they assisted him in a battle with Solomon Grundy , and the investigation of the confession and suicide of a man in the commissioner\\'s office. After a month of operating and assisting in saving civilians off a falling bridge, they were drawn to an explosion within the city and were confronted by Professor Strange and Psycho Pirate . Manipulating their feelings, Pirate made the two afraid, causing Hank to kill twenty-three of the criminals\\' followers and Claire to be paralyzed with fear. The surviving member would later kill their parents after discovering their identities. Taken to the Batcave to recuperate and inspired by a conversation between her and Duke Thomas , Claire would join Batman and the entire Justice League to battle an insane Hank, during which he died from overusing his powers. The following week, Claire suffered a similar effect to her brother, talking herself as if she was conversing with him whilst continuing to operate as Gotham Girl. During this time, she battled some of Batman\\'s lesser known enemies like Colonel Blimp , Captain Stingaree and Kite Man . Confronting her on a rooftop, Batman revealed his identity to her and offered her help dealing with the trauma. Claire accepted, breaking down in the vigilante\\'s arms as she admitted how much she missed her brother. After the encounter, she helped Batman capture Strange and defeat his Monster Men . Under Psycho Pirate\\'s Control Hoping to help restore her condition, Batman organized an assault on Peña Duro to take Psycho Pirate and restore her sanity. However, Psycho Pirate manipulated her into joining Bane , the two planning to use her in the latter\\'s schemes. Aiming to destroy Batman on a personal level, they used the Medusa Mask\\'s powers to push her to Bane\\'s side, using them to manipulate Batman into proposing to Catwoman . When Bane took over Gotham City, Gotham Girl was taken in by the Flashpoint Batman as his \"Robin\". Under his influence, she helped bring the city under the control of the supervillains and used as a deterrent for other superheroes, proving her potential by defeating Captain Atom . Batman was eventually able to defeat both villains and restore Claire to her regular state. Some time after the battle\\'s end, Claire was exposed to Platinum Kryptonite , which restored her lost lifespan. Powers and Abilities Ultra Powers : Claire has \"ultra\" powers which let her tap into a vast array of abilities (typically resembling those of Superman ) albeit with a great cost. The more of her powers she used, the more it drained her physical lifespan. Among these powers were flight, super-strength, superhuman stamina, invulnerability and endurance, and Ultra-Vision. Batman eventually negated Claire\\'s condition by exposing her to Platinum Kryptonite , restoring her lifespan and giving her the powers permanently.', 'Batman General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne Aliases: Batman The Batman The Dark Knight The World\\'s Greatest Detective The Caped Crusader Portrayed by: Kevin Conroy (voice) Appearances: Batman: The Animated Series Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero The Batman/Superman Movie Batman Beyond Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Static Shock Justice League Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Justice League Unlimited Batman is a costumed crimefighter who is actually billionaire Bruce Wayne by day.

His personal favourite was the Gray Ghost , watching the television show with his father. On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to Wonder Woman , Bruce hadn\\'t been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes\\' faithful friend and butler, Alfred Pennyworth Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from Yoru Sensei . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor\\'s daughter Zatanna became very close. As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with Andrea Beaumont . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\". War on Crime Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the Batcave . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city\\'s underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in Dick Grayson as his ward after witnessing his parents\\' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down their murderer . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and Commissioner James Gordon , working with them to control crime in Gotham. Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included the Penguin , Poison Ivy , Mr. Freeze and the Scarecrow . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including Catwoman and Two-Face . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered the Joker , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created. New Adventures Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as Batwoman . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called Batgirl began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father\\'s legacy as the next Police Commissioner. Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned Tim Drake from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder. Joining Up For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called Blüdhaven . Batman would later find himself in Metropolis , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with Lex Luthor , Batman would find himself working with Superman to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker\\'s plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue\\'s gallery. He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another\\'s home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity. Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper. It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world\\'s greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League. Saving the World Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech\\'s deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station\\'s antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J\\'onn J\\'onzz\\' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna\\'s destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch. Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman\\'s mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don\\'t even think about it\". When the Imperium\\'s attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation. Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J\\'onn J\\'onzz. After freeing J\\'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J\\'onn J\\'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of Wonder Woman . The Flash arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing\\'s severed wing. After J\\'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium\\'s invasion of Mars , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium\\'s factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun\\'s rays. The heroes split up to disable the factories. Batman went to Giza, Egypt with Wonder Woman and J\\'onn J\\'onzz. The trio infiltrated the factory and found the Ion Matrix Crystal, a vital component of the plant. Batman and Wonder Woman provided a diversion to allow J\\'onzz to remove the crystal. As he removed the crystal, J\\'onzz was incapacitated by Imperium forces. Batman then covered Wonder Woman and J\\'onzz\\' escape from the plant, but was himself trapped inside and cornered by Imperium forces. J\\'onzz reported that Batman was dead, but in truth, he had mentally shielded Batman to prevent the Imperium forces from detecting him. Batman remained hidden until the Imperium arrived on Earth. He then revealed himself and reversed the ion charge in the Ion Matrix Crystal, causing the plant to burn off the smoke it had been producing. With the sun shining again, the heroes defeated the Imperium and freed their human prisoners, then mopped up the remaining Imperium forces around the globe. Inspired by a general\\'s speech about vigilance and the possible return of the invaders, Batman had the Watchtower constructed by Wayne Enterprises, hiding the funding as a \"line item in the aerospace R&D budget\". Batman invited the other six heroes who had repelled the invaders to the station. The seven heroes formed the Justice League. Claiming he wasn\\'t a \"people person\", Batman did not officially join the League, though he did offer to be on call when the League needed his help. Long considered the brains of the League, Batman often found solutions that eluded the other members. He was quick to place himself in danger, despite the awe-inspiring powers of his teammates. During the Atlantis Usurpation, Batman put a stop to the melting of the Polar Ice Caps. On another occasion, Batman single-handedly defeated five dangerous criminals before being taken prisoner by an Amazon trained criminal. During his time with the League, Batman showed his distrust of Superman. After Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid and when Batman had to pull Superman back later when he attempted to end Darkseid\\'s life, Batman began carrying a piece of Kryptonite, which was revealed when the android Amazo copied Superman\\'s powers. However, Batman still held a deep respect for the Man of Steel, especially after he had seemingly died at the hands of Toyman. But, regardless of his respect, Batman remained stubborn in his disbelief in Superman\\'s death, and refused to mourn for him for quite a while. During the Thanagarian Invasion of Earth, Batman was forced to reveal his identity to his teammates. After successfully retaking the Watchtower from Thanagarian Forces, Batman piloted the Watchtower through the Earth\\'s atmosphere in an attempt to plunge it into a Hyperspace Bypass, a city-wide machine that would generate a wormhole through the Earth. As Batman lost consciousness due to the heat surrounding him, Superman rescued him and as the Watchtower destroyed the Bypass Generator. With the Watchtower\\'s destruction and Hawkgirl \\'s resignation from the League, Batman and the five other members reformed the Justice League with a new Watchtower and an expanded roster of heroes. Batman was instrumental in recruiting Green Arrow into the League, who along with other human league members, helped keep the League from becoming an autonomous Metahuman army. With Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, Batman fought Chronos across time, an adventure during which he met another Batman as well as his older self. He also succeeded in demonstrating to Amanda Waller that Cadmus was being used as a tool to further Lex Luthor\\'s personal agenda to discredit and destroy the Justice League. Amanda Waller was so impressed with Batman that she created Project Batman Beyond to ensure that the world would always have a Batman. Joker\\'s Final Joke After these events, Robin went missing for three weeks while on patrol, with Batman and Batgirl searching for him, until they learned he was at Arkham Asylum . They encounter Joker and Harley Quinn , who reveal that they adopted a son named J.J.(Joker, Jr.), who was actually Robin brainwashed and driven insane. Joker seems to escape, with Batman hot in pursuit. However, he was actually trying to lure Batman into Arkham\\'s Cineplex, where he reveals that he subjected Robin to countless amounts of psychological and physical tortures, and because of this, Joker now knows Batman\\'s true identity, and everything about him. Batman, enraged at the cruelty and torture Joker inflicted onto Robin, smashes through the theater box, and beats Joker down (wrecking the projector in the process, causing Joker to say \"If you don\\'t like the movie, I\\'ve got slides!\"), then hurls Joker down to the room that J.J.\\'s in. Batman threatens to break Joker in half, causing the Joker to retort that he would have done it years ago if he really wanted to do it. Suddenly, The Joker draws a switchblade, and slices Batman\\'s chest, as well as stabs his leg. He then gives what looks like a gun to J.J. and tells him to kill Batman (or, in his words, \"deliver the punchline.\"). J.J. then pulls the trigger, revealing the gun to actually be the infamous \"Bang!\" flag spear gun that is one of the Joker\\'s trademark weapons. J.J. apparently hesitates to kill Batman, causing the Joker to shout \"DO IT!\". Tim reluctantly obliges. Instead of killing Batman however, he instead turns it away at the last second, thus shooting the Joker instead, killing him. J.J. half laughs and half sobs at the events, and Batgirl (having arrived after her fight with Harley Quinn) tries to console him. Commissioner Gordon and Batman later bury the body of Joker in the ruins of Arkham, and Tim is taken to Doctor Leslie Thompkins for rehabilitation. After these events, Batman forbade Tim Drake from ever becoming Robin again. Tim attempted to go solo for a few years, but in the end quit the super-hero life, got married and had children. He broke off contact with Bruce but remained close with Barbara and perhaps Dick. Also, as a result of the fight, Batman walked with a slight limp which in his later years would force him to walk with a cane. Late Adventures Many years passed following the attack of the Joker on the Bat-Family, Bruce entered middle age and began to suffer with a bad heart from the effects of a hard life of crime fighting. Batman developed a powered high tech suit (which had longer Bat ears and minus a cape) that augmented his physical abilities and allowed him to continue the never-ending battle for a few more years. At this time, his corporate rivalry with Derek Powers began, and Wayne Enterprises resisted a hostile bid for corporate takeover. However, injuries suffered through the long decades of physical punishment and an ailing heart finally took their toll, and even the suit couldn\\'t compensate any longer. While attempting to rescue his old friend Veronica Vreeland\\'s daughter Bunny Vreeland from kidnappers, Batman managed to subdue the kidnappers with limited effort until he was forced to point a gun at a common thug to save Ms. Vreeland and his own life after suffering a heart attack while in the midst of the fight. Injured, Batman limps outside the hangar, removing his mask upon realizing he was wielding a handgun, forced to rely on the weapon of his parents\\' cowardly murderer to defend himself against criminals. Ashamed, Bruce returns to the Batcave, where he places the Batsuit in the costume display gallery. Walking to the top of the stairs, Bruce takes one last look at the Batcave and solemnly vows, \"Never again.\" Vowing to never again wear the cowl, Bruce then shuts off the lights, and leaves his past in the darkness. Passing the Mantle of the Bat When he hung up the mantle of the bat, Bruce came a recluse, shut off in Wayne Manor with his dog, Ace. He withdrew from the day to day operations of Wayne Enterprises, a decision that left the company vulnerable to a takeover by Derek Powers and caused Wayne much regret. It was now the year 2039 and Bruce Wayne had become a very old man. Chance brought teen-aged Terry McGinnis to the gates of Wayne Manor, where he learned of Bruce\\'s past secret life. After McGinnis suffered the loss of his father, Bruce reluctantly agreed to allow him to take up mantle of Batman. Bruce then served as a mentor and informant for the successor to his legacy. For years, Bruce coordinated with Terry, supplying advice and direction from the Batcave while McGinnis worked in the field. He also ran the labs and developed new gadgets for Terry to use in the new crusade against crime. The elderly Bruce Wayne occasionally ventured into the field to support Terry. His sense of duty and self-sacrifice ever present, he once donned a suit of Batman armor to rescue Terry from the villain Inque, despite Inque\\'s Metahuman power and the strain produced on Bruce\\'s already damaged heart. As Bruce continued to age, he suffered a kidney failure. When it was discovered that Terry was not just a suitable donor but a perfect one, their relationship reached its weakest point; Terry, like Dick Grayson before him, felt betrayed, manipulated, and outright used. He set off to uncover the truth from someone willing to reveal it. Terry confronted Amanda Waller and learned the truth about his heritage. In her earlier years, Waller realized the world would always need a Batman. Taking fate into her own hands (unbeknownst to Bruce), she gathered a sample of Bruce Wayne\\'s genetic material, after a battle that left Batman in need of medical attention. Using her Cadmus connections, Waller implanted this genetic material into a young Warren McGinnis, replacing his genetic material with Bruce\\'s. Thus, Terry McGinnis was born, the son of Bruce Wayne, sharing half his genetic code. Terry returned to Wayne Manor with a new sense of purpose. Bruce wondered about the fate of Gotham, and Terry replied \"I\\'ve got it covered. Always.\" Their relationship repaired; Bruce had truly become the father Terry had lost long ago. The Savage Timeline In an alternate timeline created by Vandal Savage, the Axis forces won World War II. There, Bruce Wayne lost his parents when they spoke out against the regime and became Batman to fight Savage and his forces. He served as the leader of the resistance movement, recruiting other victims. Unlike his original self, Batman was willing to use guns without a second thought. When the Justice League from the original timeline arrived, Batman helped them escape from the authorities and learned of our timeline. He assisted them in breaking into the facility where the time portal was kept. However, Batman did not accompany the League into the past to thwart Savage, preferring to stay behind and lead the resistance in case they failed. It is assumed that this reality ceased to exist when the League defeated Savage and counteract the Axis powers\\' artificial advantages. Powers and Abilities Through his years of intensive physical training, the Batman represents the peak of human physical conditioning. Batman is at peak human levels of strength, stamina, agility, coordination, reflexes, speed, and durability. Even well into old age, Bruce Wayne still demonstrated that he could manhandle other much younger men with ease. Batman\\'s martial arts discipline was never mentioned, in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Bruce Wayne mentions Ju Jitsu. Batman was also a master of stealth and infiltration (all the more remarkable given that he stands 6\\'2\" and weighs 215 lbs), and often revealed himself to his enemies when they least suspected him to. This also allowed him to just disappear from allies in mid-sentence, a habit that frequently annoyed the likes of Commissioner Gordon (\"one of these days I\\'m gonna nail his feet to the ground\") and Harvey Bullock (\"I wonder how the Commish puts up with that\"). Batman was capable of incredible feats of agility. During the Second Apokolyptian invasion, Darkseid commented with much surprise that Batman had been the first one to dodge his Omega Beams. With his martial arts prowess, occasionally augmented by technology, Batman was usually more than a match for any foe he encountered, human or otherwise. Equipment As the head of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce Wayne has access to cutting edge technology and Batman makes good use of it in his field equipment. Batsuit-standard as well as heat-resistant, cold-resistant, and underwater versions. Batarangs-of differing size and effect. These ranged from standard, to explosive, electric, remote, etc. Grapple-gun. This item assisted Batman in scaling the various buildings of Gotham City. Utility Belt - Batman\\'s Utility Belt has compartments to hold several items, the contents of which change according to his needs, and often include items such as flashlights, laser cutters, underwater rebreathers, binoculars, a fingerprinting kit, flashbangs, remote controls for his vehicles, acid/base compounds, anti-toxins, mini-computer, and smoke pellets. Vehicles Batman has used several vehicles in the course of his crimefighting career, including: Batmobile Batwing Batcycle Batboat Appearances Batman: The Animated Series Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero The New Batman Adventures Superman: The Animated Series Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Batman Beyond Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Justice League Justice League Unlimited Static Shock'],\n",
      "    response='No, Batman does not have superpowers like invisibility or the ability to shoot webs from his hands. In the DC universe, Batman—whose real name is Bruce Wayne—is portrayed as a highly skilled human vigilante without any innate superhuman abilities. Instead, he relies on his exceptional training, intelligence, and technology to fight crime. For example, he achieves feats that might seem superhuman through peak physical condition (like expert martial arts and acrobatics), genius-level detective skills, and advanced gadgets from his utility belt, such as batarangs or smoke pellets.\\n\\nThis makes Batman unique compared to characters like Spider-Man, as his effectiveness comes from preparation, strategy, and human determination rather than biological enhancements.

      "    reasoning=\"The user's question about Batman's biggest enemies is straightforward, but given the empty conversation history, this is likely a standalone query. The context from the Batman wiki provides detailed information on his enemies, including the Joker as the primary arch-nemesis and a list of others like Catwoman, Penguin, and Bane. The student's goal is to deepen knowledge of superhero lore, so I'll focus on key adversaries and their relationships to make the answer educational and engaging. The pragmatic need suggests curiosity for entertainment or discussion, so I'll craft a cooperative response that summarizes the main enemies, explains their significance briefly, and anticipates follow-ups by suggesting more details or related topics, like specific storylines or motivations, to encourage further conversation.\",\n",
      "    cooperative_answer=\"Batman's biggest enemies are a rogues gallery of iconic villains from the DC Comics universe, each bringing their own unique threats and motivations that challenge his sense of justice. At the top of the list is his arch-nemesis, the Joker, a chaotic clown who embodies anarchy and has pushed Batman to his limits in countless stories with his unpredictable schemes and psychological warfare. Other major foes include Catwoman, a cunning anti-heroine with a complex romantic history with Batman; the Penguin, a crime lord with a penchant for elaborate gadgets and underworld dealings; Two-Face, once Bruce Wayne's friend Harvey Dent, whose split personality drives him to obsessive duality; Bane, a physically dominant brute who once broke Batman both mentally and physically; and Poison Ivy, an eco-terrorist with plant-based powers and a radical environmental agenda. These enemies not only represent different aspects of crime and villainy but also highlight Batman's internal conflicts, like his no-kill rule and moral boundaries. If you're diving into superhero lore, it's fascinating how these characters' backstories often tie into Batman's own history— for example, the Joker might stem from themes of madness, while Bane challenges Batman's physical prowess. If you'd like more details on any specific enemy, their origins, or key comic storylines like 'Knightfall' for Bane, just let me know—I'm here to help expand on that!\",\n",

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate .

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running.

He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations.

He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History.

Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber.

Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition.

This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons.

Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas.

The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate . His primary form of combat is a harmonious mixture of Jui-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Judo, Muay Thai, Savate, Karate, Kung Fu, Boxing, Capoeira, Krav Maga, Aikido, and Ninjutsu. Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21. He has mastered Diverse Environmental Training, Security Systems, and illusion/sleight of hand by the time he was 23. He gained even more degrees in Biology, Physics, Advanced Chemistry, and Technology by the time he was 25. He has learned Forensic, Medical Sciences, Expanded Computer and Engineering Sciences, and Expanded Device Pool use of personal powered armor and system, database creation on underworld crime bosses, rogue\\'s gallery foes and other supers; improved material sciences for body armor and micro-machinery by the time he was 26. Has also learned Advanced New Development in Forensic and Medical Sciences. Master Tactician : He is a master strategist and tactician commonly utilizes extremely cunning tactics, strategies, and protocols to outwit his foes. He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture. Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced.

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running.

He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations.

He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21.

He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition.

Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits. Batcycle Bat-Glider', 'The Batman General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne Aliases: The Batman The Dark Knight Portrayed by: Rino Romano Appearances: The Batman The Batman Strikes! The Batman vs. Dracula The Batman is a masked vigilante and the hero of Gotham City . Batman is the secret identity of billionaire Bruce Wayne , the CEO of Wayne Enterprises, who, after witnessing the death of his parents, vowed to spend the rest of his life warring on all criminals. He is a founding member of the Justice League . Contents 1 History 2 Appearance 3 Powers and Abilities 4 Paraphernalia 4.1 Equipment 4.2 Transportation 4.3 Weapons 4.4 Batsuits 5 Appearances 6 Trivia 7 Voiced by History Bruce Wayne was born a child of wealth and privilege to Thomas and Martha Wayne of Gotham City. As the Waynes\\' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father\\'s business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler, Alfred Pennyworth , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents\\' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City. As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named Ethan Bennett . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\". As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents\\' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot. For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman\\'s activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police Angel Rojas took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named Ellen Yin , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham. In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date – the Joker . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes. The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham\\'s underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named Bane . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of the Penguin , Man-Bat , Killer Croc , Cluemaster and Catwoman . One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce\\'s career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface. Some time later, a new character entered the Batman\\'s life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally. Barbara Gordon , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordan , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend Poison Ivy from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara\\'s aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt. The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist Dick Grayson was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named Tony Zucco . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick\\'s acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force. Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself John Jones . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called the Joining . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth\\'s atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John\\'s behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as Lex Luthor . At some point later, in the year 2027, Mr. Freeze had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named Nightwing . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever. One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave\\'s titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman\\'s legacy survived into the future.

His personal favourite was the Gray Ghost , watching the television show with his father. On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to Wonder Woman , Bruce hadn\\'t been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes\\' faithful friend and butler, Alfred Pennyworth Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from Yoru Sensei . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor\\'s daughter Zatanna became very close. As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with Andrea Beaumont . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\". War on Crime Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the Batcave . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city\\'s underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in Dick Grayson as his ward after witnessing his parents\\' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down their murderer . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and Commissioner James Gordon , working with them to control crime in Gotham. Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included the Penguin , Poison Ivy , Mr. Freeze and the Scarecrow . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including Catwoman and Two-Face . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered the Joker , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created. New Adventures Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as Batwoman . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called Batgirl began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father\\'s legacy as the next Police Commissioner. Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned Tim Drake from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder. Joining Up For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called Blüdhaven . Batman would later find himself in Metropolis , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with Lex Luthor , Batman would find himself working with Superman to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker\\'s plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue\\'s gallery. He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another\\'s home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity. Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper. It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world\\'s greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League. Saving the World Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech\\'s deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station\\'s antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J\\'onn J\\'onzz\\' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna\\'s destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch. Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman\\'s mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don\\'t even think about it\". When the Imperium\\'s attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation. Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J\\'onn J\\'onzz. After freeing J\\'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J\\'onn J\\'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of Wonder Woman . The Flash arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing\\'s severed wing. After J\\'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium\\'s invasion of Mars , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium\\'s factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun\\'s rays. The heroes split up to disable the factories. Batman went to Giza, Egypt with Wonder Woman and J\\'onn J\\'onzz. The trio infiltrated the factory and found the Ion Matrix Crystal, a vital component of the plant. Batman and Wonder Woman provided a diversion to allow J\\'onzz to remove the crystal. As he removed the crystal, J\\'onzz was incapacitated by Imperium forces. Batman then covered Wonder Woman and J\\'onzz\\' escape from the plant, but was himself trapped inside and cornered by Imperium forces. J\\'onzz reported that Batman was dead, but in truth, he had mentally shielded Batman to prevent the Imperium forces from detecting him. Batman remained hidden until the Imperium arrived on Earth. He then revealed himself and reversed the ion charge in the Ion Matrix Crystal, causing the plant to burn off the smoke it had been producing. With the sun shining again, the heroes defeated the Imperium and freed their human prisoners, then mopped up the remaining Imperium forces around the globe. Inspired by a general\\'s speech about vigilance and the possible return of the invaders, Batman had the Watchtower constructed by Wayne Enterprises, hiding the funding as a \"line item in the aerospace R&D budget\". Batman invited the other six heroes who had repelled the invaders to the station. The seven heroes formed the Justice League. Claiming he wasn\\'t a \"people person\", Batman did not officially join the League, though he did offer to be on call when the League needed his help. Long considered the brains of the League, Batman often found solutions that eluded the other members. He was quick to place himself in danger, despite the awe-inspiring powers of his teammates. During the Atlantis Usurpation, Batman put a stop to the melting of the Polar Ice Caps. On another occasion, Batman single-handedly defeated five dangerous criminals before being taken prisoner by an Amazon trained criminal. During his time with the League, Batman showed his distrust of Superman. After Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid and when Batman had to pull Superman back later when he attempted to end Darkseid\\'s life, Batman began carrying a piece of Kryptonite, which was revealed when the android Amazo copied Superman\\'s powers. However, Batman still held a deep respect for the Man of Steel, especially after he had seemingly died at the hands of Toyman. But, regardless of his respect, Batman remained stubborn in his disbelief in Superman\\'s death, and refused to mourn for him for quite a while. During the Thanagarian Invasion of Earth, Batman was forced to reveal his identity to his teammates. After successfully retaking the Watchtower from Thanagarian Forces, Batman piloted the Watchtower through the Earth\\'s atmosphere in an attempt to plunge it into a Hyperspace Bypass, a city-wide machine that would generate a wormhole through the Earth. As Batman lost consciousness due to the heat surrounding him, Superman rescued him and as the Watchtower destroyed the Bypass Generator. With the Watchtower\\'s destruction and Hawkgirl \\'s resignation from the League, Batman and the five other members reformed the Justice League with a new Watchtower and an expanded roster of heroes. Batman was instrumental in recruiting Green Arrow into the League, who along with other human league members, helped keep the League from becoming an autonomous Metahuman army. With Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, Batman fought Chronos across time, an adventure during which he met another Batman as well as his older self. He also succeeded in demonstrating to Amanda Waller that Cadmus was being used as a tool to further Lex Luthor\\'s personal agenda to discredit and destroy the Justice League. Amanda Waller was so impressed with Batman that she created Project Batman Beyond to ensure that the world would always have a Batman. Joker\\'s Final Joke After these events, Robin went missing for three weeks while on patrol, with Batman and Batgirl searching for him, until they learned he was at Arkham Asylum . They encounter Joker and Harley Quinn , who reveal that they adopted a son named J.J.(Joker, Jr.), who was actually Robin brainwashed and driven insane. Joker seems to escape, with Batman hot in pursuit. However, he was actually trying to lure Batman into Arkham\\'s Cineplex, where he reveals that he subjected Robin to countless amounts of psychological and physical tortures, and because of this, Joker now knows Batman\\'s true identity, and everything about him. Batman, enraged at the cruelty and torture Joker inflicted onto Robin, smashes through the theater box, and beats Joker down (wrecking the projector in the process, causing Joker to say \"If you don\\'t like the movie, I\\'ve got slides!\"), then hurls Joker down to the room that J.J.\\'s in. Batman threatens to break Joker in half, causing the Joker to retort that he would have done it years ago if he really wanted to do it. Suddenly, The Joker draws a switchblade, and slices Batman\\'s chest, as well as stabs his leg. He then gives what looks like a gun to J.J. and tells him to kill Batman (or, in his words, \"deliver the punchline.\"). J.J. then pulls the trigger, revealing the gun to actually be the infamous \"Bang!\" flag spear gun that is one of the Joker\\'s trademark weapons. J.J. apparently hesitates to kill Batman, causing the Joker to shout \"DO IT!\". Tim reluctantly obliges. Instead of killing Batman however, he instead turns it away at the last second, thus shooting the Joker instead, killing him. J.J. half laughs and half sobs at the events, and Batgirl (having arrived after her fight with Harley Quinn) tries to console him. Commissioner Gordon and Batman later bury the body of Joker in the ruins of Arkham, and Tim is taken to Doctor Leslie Thompkins for rehabilitation. After these events, Batman forbade Tim Drake from ever becoming Robin again. Tim attempted to go solo for a few years, but in the end quit the super-hero life, got married and had children. He broke off contact with Bruce but remained close with Barbara and perhaps Dick. Also, as a result of the fight, Batman walked with a slight limp which in his later years would force him to walk with a cane. Late Adventures Many years passed following the attack of the Joker on the Bat-Family, Bruce entered middle age and began to suffer with a bad heart from the effects of a hard life of crime fighting. Batman developed a powered high tech suit (which had longer Bat ears and minus a cape) that augmented his physical abilities and allowed him to continue the never-ending battle for a few more years. At this time, his corporate rivalry with Derek Powers began, and Wayne Enterprises resisted a hostile bid for corporate takeover. However, injuries suffered through the long decades of physical punishment and an ailing heart finally took their toll, and even the suit couldn\\'t compensate any longer. While attempting to rescue his old friend Veronica Vreeland\\'s daughter Bunny Vreeland from kidnappers, Batman managed to subdue the kidnappers with limited effort until he was forced to point a gun at a common thug to save Ms. Vreeland and his own life after suffering a heart attack while in the midst of the fight. Injured, Batman limps outside the hangar, removing his mask upon realizing he was wielding a handgun, forced to rely on the weapon of his parents\\' cowardly murderer to defend himself against criminals. Ashamed, Bruce returns to the Batcave, where he places the Batsuit in the costume display gallery. Walking to the top of the stairs, Bruce takes one last look at the Batcave and solemnly vows, \"Never again.\" Vowing to never again wear the cowl, Bruce then shuts off the lights, and leaves his past in the darkness. Passing the Mantle of the Bat When he hung up the mantle of the bat, Bruce came a recluse, shut off in Wayne Manor with his dog, Ace. He withdrew from the day to day operations of Wayne Enterprises, a decision that left the company vulnerable to a takeover by Derek Powers and caused Wayne much regret. It was now the year 2039 and Bruce Wayne had become a very old man. Chance brought teen-aged Terry McGinnis to the gates of Wayne Manor, where he learned of Bruce\\'s past secret life. After McGinnis suffered the loss of his father, Bruce reluctantly agreed to allow him to take up mantle of Batman. Bruce then served as a mentor and informant for the successor to his legacy. For years, Bruce coordinated with Terry, supplying advice and direction from the Batcave while McGinnis worked in the field. He also ran the labs and developed new gadgets for Terry to use in the new crusade against crime. The elderly Bruce Wayne occasionally ventured into the field to support Terry. His sense of duty and self-sacrifice ever present, he once donned a suit of Batman armor to rescue Terry from the villain Inque, despite Inque\\'s Metahuman power and the strain produced on Bruce\\'s already damaged heart. As Bruce continued to age, he suffered a kidney failure. When it was discovered that Terry was not just a suitable donor but a perfect one, their relationship reached its weakest point; Terry, like Dick Grayson before him, felt betrayed, manipulated, and outright used. He set off to uncover the truth from someone willing to reveal it. Terry confronted Amanda Waller and learned the truth about his heritage. In her earlier years, Waller realized the world would always need a Batman. Taking fate into her own hands (unbeknownst to Bruce), she gathered a sample of Bruce Wayne\\'s genetic material, after a battle that left Batman in need of medical attention. Using her Cadmus connections, Waller implanted this genetic material into a young Warren McGinnis, replacing his genetic material with Bruce\\'s. Thus, Terry McGinnis was born, the son of Bruce Wayne, sharing half his genetic code. Terry returned to Wayne Manor with a new sense of purpose. Bruce wondered about the fate of Gotham, and Terry replied \"I\\'ve got it covered. Always.\" Their relationship repaired; Bruce had truly become the father Terry had lost long ago. The Savage Timeline In an alternate timeline created by Vandal Savage, the Axis forces won World War II. There, Bruce Wayne lost his parents when they spoke out against the regime and became Batman to fight Savage and his forces. He served as the leader of the resistance movement, recruiting other victims. Unlike his original self, Batman was willing to use guns without a second thought. When the Justice League from the original timeline arrived, Batman helped them escape from the authorities and learned of our timeline. He assisted them in breaking into the facility where the time portal was kept. However, Batman did not accompany the League into the past to thwart Savage, preferring to stay behind and lead the resistance in case they failed. It is assumed that this reality ceased to exist when the League defeated Savage and counteract the Axis powers\\' artificial advantages. Powers and Abilities Through his years of intensive physical training, the Batman represents the peak of human physical conditioning. Batman is at peak human levels of strength, stamina, agility, coordination, reflexes, speed, and durability. Even well into old age, Bruce Wayne still demonstrated that he could manhandle other much younger men with ease. Batman\\'s martial arts discipline was never mentioned, in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Bruce Wayne mentions Ju Jitsu. Batman was also a master of stealth and infiltration (all the more remarkable given that he stands 6\\'2\" and weighs 215 lbs), and often revealed himself to his enemies when they least suspected him to. This also allowed him to just disappear from allies in mid-sentence, a habit that frequently annoyed the likes of Commissioner Gordon (\"one of these days I\\'m gonna nail his feet to the ground\") and Harvey Bullock (\"I wonder how the Commish puts up with that\"). Batman was capable of incredible feats of agility. During the Second Apokolyptian invasion, Darkseid commented with much surprise that Batman had been the first one to dodge his Omega Beams. With his martial arts prowess, occasionally augmented by technology, Batman was usually more than a match for any foe he encountered, human or otherwise. Equipment As the head of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce Wayne has access to cutting edge technology and Batman makes good use of it in his field equipment. Batsuit-standard as well as heat-resistant, cold-resistant, and underwater versions. Batarangs-of differing size and effect. These ranged from standard, to explosive, electric, remote, etc. Grapple-gun. This item assisted Batman in scaling the various buildings of Gotham City. Utility Belt - Batman\\'s Utility Belt has compartments to hold several items, the contents of which change according to his needs, and often include items such as flashlights, laser cutters, underwater rebreathers, binoculars, a fingerprinting kit, flashbangs, remote controls for his vehicles, acid/base compounds, anti-toxins, mini-computer, and smoke pellets. Vehicles Batman has used several vehicles in the course of his crimefighting career, including: Batmobile Batwing Batcycle Batboat Appearances Batman: The Animated Series Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero The New Batman Adventures Superman: The Animated Series Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Batman Beyond Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Justice League Justice League Unlimited Static Shock'],\n",
      "    response=\"Batman's biggest enemies are a rogues gallery of iconic villains from the DC Comics universe, each bringing their own unique threats and motivations that challenge his sense of justice. At the top of the list is his arch-nemesis, the Joker, a chaotic clown who embodies anarchy and has pushed Batman to his limits in countless stories with his unpredictable schemes and psychological warfare. Other major foes include Catwoman, a cunning anti-heroine with a complex romantic history with Batman; the Penguin, a crime lord with a penchant for elaborate gadgets and underworld dealings; Two-Face, once Bruce Wayne's friend Harvey Dent, whose split personality drives him to obsessive duality; Bane, a physically dominant brute who once broke Batman both mentally and physically; and Poison Ivy, an eco-terrorist with plant-based powers and a radical environmental agenda. These enemies not only represent different aspects of crime and villainy but also highlight Batman's internal conflicts, like his no-kill rule and moral boundaries. If you're diving into superhero lore, it's fascinating how these characters' backstories often tie into Batman's own history— for example, the Joker might stem from themes of madness, while Bane challenges Batman's physical prowess.

As the Waynes\\' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father\\'s business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler, Alfred Pennyworth , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents\\' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City. As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named Ethan Bennett . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\". As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents\\' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot. For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman\\'s activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police Angel Rojas took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named Ellen Yin , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham. In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date – the Joker . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes. The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham\\'s underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named Bane . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of the Penguin , Man-Bat , Killer Croc , Cluemaster and Catwoman . One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce\\'s career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface. Some time later, a new character entered the Batman\\'s life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally. Barbara Gordon , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordan , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend Poison Ivy from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara\\'s aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt. The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist Dick Grayson was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named Tony Zucco . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick\\'s acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force. Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself John Jones . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called the Joining . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth\\'s atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John\\'s behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as Lex Luthor . At some point later, in the year 2027, Mr. Freeze had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named Nightwing . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever. One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave\\'s titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman\\'s legacy survived into the future. Appearance Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights. He also wears a dark gray costume with a black bat-emblem, black trunks, gloves, and knee high boots. Powers and Abilities Master Acrobat: Excellent in gymnastics and acrobatics.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate . His primary form of combat is a harmonious mixture of Jui-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Judo, Muay Thai, Savate, Karate, Kung Fu, Boxing, Capoeira, Krav Maga, Aikido, and Ninjutsu. Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21. He has mastered Diverse Environmental Training, Security Systems, and illusion/sleight of hand by the time he was 23. He gained even more degrees in Biology, Physics, Advanced Chemistry, and Technology by the time he was 25. He has learned Forensic, Medical Sciences, Expanded Computer and Engineering Sciences, and Expanded Device Pool use of personal powered armor and system, database creation on underworld crime bosses, rogue\\'s gallery foes and other supers; improved material sciences for body armor and micro-machinery by the time he was 26. Has also learned Advanced New Development in Forensic and Medical Sciences. Master Tactician : He is a master strategist and tactician commonly utilizes extremely cunning tactics, strategies, and protocols to outwit his foes. He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture. Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate . His primary form of combat is a harmonious mixture of Jui-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Judo, Muay Thai, Savate, Karate, Kung Fu, Boxing, Capoeira, Krav Maga, Aikido, and Ninjutsu. Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21. He has mastered Diverse Environmental Training, Security Systems, and illusion/sleight of hand by the time he was 23. He gained even more degrees in Biology, Physics, Advanced Chemistry, and Technology by the time he was 25. He has learned Forensic, Medical Sciences, Expanded Computer and Engineering Sciences, and Expanded Device Pool use of personal powered armor and system, database creation on underworld crime bosses, rogue\\'s gallery foes and other supers; improved material sciences for body armor and micro-machinery by the time he was 26. Has also learned Advanced New Development in Forensic and Medical Sciences. Master Tactician : He is a master strategist and tactician commonly utilizes extremely cunning tactics, strategies, and protocols to outwit his foes. He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture. Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced.

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21. He has mastered Diverse Environmental Training, Security Systems, and illusion/sleight of hand by the time he was 23. He gained even more degrees in Biology, Physics, Advanced Chemistry, and Technology by the time he was 25. He has learned Forensic, Medical Sciences, Expanded Computer and Engineering Sciences, and Expanded Device Pool use of personal powered armor and system, database creation on underworld crime bosses, rogue\\'s gallery foes and other supers; improved material sciences for body armor and micro-machinery by the time he was 26. Has also learned Advanced New Development in Forensic and Medical Sciences. Master Tactician : He is a master strategist and tactician commonly utilizes extremely cunning tactics, strategies, and protocols to outwit his foes. He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture. Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

    "1) The model achieves higher scores when the question is specific and contains named entities as well as unambiguous nouns and verbs. For example: “What is Batmans real name?” (score = 0.75)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) This specificity provides a double advantage: it allows the retriever to fetch more relevant context, and it helps the pipeline rely effectively on the context in situations where there is no prior conversation history, which is the case in this experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Conversely, the model performs poorly and can even score zero when the question is ambiguous or amorphous, for example: “What is the movie about?” (score = 0.0)\n",
    "In such cases, the retriever often returns weak or unrelated context, and without previous chat history,the generated answer is largely irrelevant and is based on knowledge from the LLM's pretraining or on the irrelevant context.\n",

    "Our task involves a two-step pipeline. Given relevant source files (the context), the user’s conversational history (the history), and a question, the model first enriches the input by inferring theory of mind (ToM) elements such as the user’s goal and pragmatic need. In the second step, the model answers the question cooperatively based on this enriched representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we chose MIPROv2 as the optimizer for the two-step pipeline and SemanticF1 as the optimization metric, for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "**SemanticF1 as the metric**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it is the metric we already used in previous sections to evaluate answer quality. Since this section aims to optimize performance relative to earlier ones, it is most consistent to optimize with respect to the same metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, more generally, SemanticF1 is well-suited for open-ended questions where answers can be long, complex, and non-uniform. It evaluates semantic similarity between system outputs and ground-truth answers, capturing partial matches and conceptual overlap rather than requiring exact wording.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MIPROv2 as the optimizer**\n",
    "MIPROv2 generates instructions and few-shot demonstrations for each step. Its instruction generation is both data-aware and demonstration-aware. It uses Bayesian Optimization to efficiently search over the space of possible generation instructions and demonstrations across modules, making it well-suited for optimizing multi-step pipelines like ours."

      "Example({'question': 'In the House of Dragons, are new episodes released weekly or are full seasons released at a time for streaming?', 'response': 'They are released each week, HBO does this thing, like \"appointment viewing\" or must see TV type event viewings, they try to build buzz and maximize cash. Smart right? For instance say you get an HBO trial month or something? You get midway through, you are likely to renew, whereas if you dump it all, you\\'re not getting that money.'}) (input_keys=None)\n",
      "Prediction(\n",
      "    reasoning=\"Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to analyze the inputs and craft a response that is accurate, pragmatic, and anticipatory. First, the conversation history shows the user has been deeply engaged in questions about Game of Thrones, including its characters, episodes, seasons, and the spinoff House of the Dragon. This indicates a pattern of interest in the broader universe, so I need to maintain continuity by linking my response back to this context while shifting focus to the spinoff. The current question specifically asks about the episode release format for House of the Dragon, which builds on their previous query about the spinoff series.\\n\\nNext, the context provided is from the Game of Thrones Wiki, detailing transmission dates for various seasons (e.g., Season 2 episodes aired from April 1 to June 3, 2012, suggesting a weekly release pattern). While this doesn't directly address House of the Dragon, it implies HBO's historical approach to releasing episodes weekly for their flagship shows, which can inform my answer. I know from general knowledge that House of the Dragon followed a similar weekly release strategy, so I'll draw on this to provide an accurate response while cross-referencing the context for consistency.\\n\\nThe student's goal is to expand their knowledge of the Game of Thrones universe and manage viewing expectations, so my response should be educational and practical, helping them plan their watching experience. The pragmatic need involves deciding between weekly releases for real-time discussions or full-season drops for binge-watching, which means I should address potential spoiler risks and offer tips to enhance their engagement, such as suggesting platforms or community involvement.\\n\\nIncorporating Theory of Mind, I infer the user might feel excited but cautious as a fan, so an empathetic, proactive answer will build trust and encourage dialogue. To make it anticipatory, I'll address follow-up possibilities like where to stream, what to expect from the series, or how it compares to Game of Thrones. Finally, ensure the response is concise, engaging, and balanced, drawing from the context to reinforce HBO's patterns while aligning with the user's goals and needs to foster ongoing conversation.\",\n",
      "    cooperative_answer=\"Hey there! As a fellow fan of the Game of Thrones universe, I totally get your excitement about House of the Dragon—it's a fantastic way to dive deeper into that epic world. From what we know based on HBO's release patterns (like the weekly episode drops for Game of Thrones seasons, such as Season 2 airing from April to June), House of the Dragon Season 1 episodes were released weekly. For example, it premiered on August 21, 2022, with new episodes dropping every Sunday on HBO and HBO Max, giving fans that thrilling week-by-week buildup.\\n\\nThis weekly format is great if you want to join in on real-time discussions, share theories with the community, and avoid spoilers by watching as they air. If you're more into binge-watching for an uninterrupted experience, you might have to wait for the full season to hit streaming platforms—HBO often makes episodes available on demand shortly after airing, or you can catch up later. Just a heads-up: checking official HBO schedules or apps can help you plan around potential delays for future seasons.\\n\\nIf you're deciding how to approach it, going weekly could make it more interactive and fun, especially if you're chatting about it with friends, but if spoilers are a concern, setting up a binge plan might be smarter. What do you think—ready to start watching, or do you have questions about specific episodes, where to stream, or how it ties back to Game of Thrones?\",\n",

Season 2 has a budget 15% higher than Season 1 , putting it in the region of $69 million. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss returned as executive producers and showrunners. The season premiered on April 1, 2012. Season 2 is mostly based on A Clash of Kings , the second book in the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R.R. Martin .

The Seven Kingdoms are at war, with the King in the North , Robb Stark , fighting to win independence for his people and those of the Riverlands . Robb decides that he must win the allegiance of the fiercely independent ironborn to his cause, and sends his best friend Theon Greyjoy to treat with his father , who is hatching plans of his own. Meanwhile, Joffrey Baratheon holds the Iron Throne with the backing of the powerful House Lannister , but his uncle Renly has also claimed the throne with the support of House Tyrell , whose armies are much larger. As they struggle for the throne, Tyrion Lannister arrives in King\\'s Landing to take matters in hand, only to face opposition from his scheming sister, Cersei , now the Queen Regent. However, there is another faction entering the picture. Stannis Baratheon , Robert\\'s younger brother and Renly\\'s older brother, has also claimed the Iron Throne. A proven battle commander and veteran of several wars , Stannis is known to be utterly without mercy to his enemies and will do what is right even if it destroys him. Advising him is Melisandre , an enigmatic priestess from the east, who believes Stannis is meant for a greater destiny , and Ser Davos Seaworth , an honest and honorable man uneasy with the shifts in power at Stannis\\' court. Far to the east, Daenerys Targaryen has hatched the only three dragons in the world. Eventually they will grow into terrifying monsters capable of destroying cities at her command, but for now they are still hatchlings and vulnerable. With her khalasar gone, Daenerys and her small band of followers must find a way across a forbidding wasteland and find new allies to support her claim to the Iron Throne. In the distant north, the Night\\'s Watch has mounted an expedition beyond the Wall , searching for missing rangers and investigating rumors of wildlings gathering in the mountains. For Jon Snow this will be a rite of passage as he is asked to make difficult choices, for the realm and for himself. Production Filming of Season 2 again took place in Northern Ireland , on location and at the Paint Hall studio facility in Belfast . Additional filming, for the Night\\'s Watch storyline, took place in Iceland . Malta was not used for filming in Season 2, with the city of Dubrovnik in Croatia standing in for King\\'s Landing instead and used for the new location of Qarth .

The action begins in the unified Seven Kingdoms of Westeros as the long summer ends and winter draws near. Lord Eddard Stark is asked by his old friend, King Robert Baratheon , to serve as the Hand of the King following the death of the previous incumbent, Eddard\\'s mentor Jon Arryn . Eddard is reluctant but receives intelligence suggesting that Jon was murdered. Eddard accepts Robert\\'s offer, planning to use his position and authority to investigate the alleged murder. Meanwhile, on the eastern continent of Essos , the exiled children of House Targaryen , which Robert destroyed to claim the throne, are plotting to return to Westeros and unseat the \\'usurper\\'. To this end, Viserys Targaryen arranges the marriage of his sister Daenerys to Khal Drogo , the leader of 40,000 Dothraki warriors, in return for the use of his warriors in invading Westeros. For her part, Daenerys just wants to find a safe refuge far away from King Robert\\'s assassins and her brother\\'s scheming ambition. Finally, on the northern-most border of the Seven Kingdoms the sworn brothers of the Night\\'s Watch guard the Wall , a 300-mile-long colossal fortification of ice which has stood for thousands of years. The Watch defends the Wall against the depredations of the lawless wildlings who live beyond, but rumor speaks of a new threat arising in the lands of perpetual winter.

The cruel boy-king Joffrey Baratheon has won a great victory by securing an alliance with House Tyrell , with his supporters defeating his uncle Stannis in an epic battle . Joffrey now commands the largest armies in the realm and his triumph appears inevitable. King Robb Stark remains in the field, however his homeland, the North , is partially under ironborn occupation. Robb needs to decide on a course of action to win an overall victory. He must also win back the allegiance of House Frey , whom he has offended by breaking his marriage pact with them. King Robb has won every battle he has fought, but as with old King Robert , the Starks will have to see if good soldiers make good kings. Stannis Baratheon may be defeated and most of his army destroyed or scattered, but he is not out of the fight yet. Having retreated to his headquarters on Dragonstone island with his handful of surviving soldiers, Stannis\\' status as the last legitimate heir to his older brother Robert still casts a shadow over Joffrey\\'s claim to the throne. With the priestess Melisandre at his side, Stannis can still influence the course of the war by striking where least expected. The lives of many others still hang in the balance. Bran Stark and his protectors must cross the frozen wastelands of the North to reach the Wall , while Arya must brave the war-torn Riverlands in search of her mother and brother. Brienne of Tarth also has the thankless task of escorting the captive Jaime Lannister home across hundreds of miles of battlefields and carnage. Theon Greyjoy must face the consequences of his actions at Winterfell . And in King\\'s Landing both Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark must brave the currents of a much more dangerous court in order to survive. On the eastern continent , Daenerys Targaryen has fled the political viper-pit of Qarth . Her dragons are growing and her fame is spreading, but to take the Iron Throne she will need supporters and an army. Both may be found in the corrupt cities of Slaver\\'s Bay ... for a price. Beyond the Wall , the White Walkers are on the move, threatening both the Seven Kingdoms and the lands of the Free Folk . While the Night\\'s Watch faces the threat of the White Walkers in the field, Jon Snow must infiltrate the wildling army of Mance Rayder and discover the King-Beyond-the-Wall \\'s plans. Production The series again filmed primarily in Northern Ireland, and also returned to Iceland and Croatia. The production also added Morocco to the locations roster. The production expanded to three production units, adding a new \"Raven\" unit to the existing \"Dragon\" and \"Wolf\" units. Production in Croatia continued to use the walled medieval city of Dubrovnik to film external scenes for King\\'s Landing , and Iceland was again used to film scenes set in the frozen lands that Jon Snow and the Night\\'s Watch encounter Beyond the Wall . Production in the new location of Morocco filmed Daenerys Targaryen \\'s new storyline in Slaver\\'s Bay as well as some King\\'s Landing exterior shots. The scene from the episode \" The Bear and the Maiden Fair \" during which Brienne of Tarth is thrown into a bear pit at Harrenhal involved a real trained stunt bear, Bart the Bear . Due to are various legal restrictions on international transport of large animals such as bears, parts of this scene were technically filmed in Los Angeles in the United States. A duplicate of the bear pit set was created in a Los Angeles studio parking lot: only Gwendoline Christie (Brienne) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime) were brought in to film, with no extras. Both actually did film with the bear in the set. Filming in Season 1 included locations in Northern Ireland and Malta, but filming did not return to Malta in subsequent seasons. The Targaryen storyline in Pentos was filmed in the Maltese presidential palace (as well as a few other scenes for King\\'s Landing). Maltese officials were reportedly annoyed that a nude scene was filmed in the palace (Daenerys\\'s bath in the first episode), which may have influenced why production did not return to that country. Season 2 expanded to film in Croatia and Iceland, and filming continued in those two countries through Season 3 and Season 4. In Season 3 production expanded to Morocco, but did not return to Morocco for Season 4. The result is that the production on Season 3 was a monumental, international effort involving units and cast members which were filming simultaneously in four separate countries. The series has filmed in five countries overall, but filming in Malta ended before production expanded to the other three countries. This number increases to six if one counts the footage of the actor-bear used in Season 3. Because filming did not return to Morocco in Season 4, this makes Season 3 the most widespread international filming project that the TV series has engaged in to date.

In contrast to previous seasons, the seventh season has been shortened to seven episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes involving larger set pieces than in previous seasons. Filming began in Belfast on August 31, 2016 and ended in February 2017. The season premiered on July 16, 2017. Like the sixth season, Season 7 is based on an outline of the two final, presently-unpublished novels in George R.R. Martin \\'s A Song of Ice and Fire series, The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring .

In King\\'s Landing , Cersei Lannister has finally seized the power that she has craved for many years. In one swift move, she has eliminated nearly all of her enemies, rivals, and obstructions; Queen Margaery Tyrell , Lord Mace Tyrell , Ser Loras Tyrell , Cersei\\'s uncle Ser Kevan Lannister , Grand Maester Pycelle , the High Sparrow , and most of - if not all - members of the Faith Militant were killed when the Great Sept of Baelor was destroyed using large amounts of wildfire , an event orchestrated by Cersei. She has crowned herself the undisputed Queen of the Seven Kingdoms , with Qyburn as her Hand and the undead knight Ser Gregor Clegane at her side. After nearly four decades of serving as the power behind the throne, House Lannister has finally become the new royal house. However, Cersei is still haunted by the prophecy she was told during her childhood, which claimed that the deaths of her three (future) children would predate her own; Joffrey , Myrcella , and Tommen are all dead, Tommen having taken his own life shortly after the Sept\\'s destruction. This has made Cersei all the more determined to crush her enemies once and for all, but the number of her enemies has just increased exponentially. Though she now sits on the Iron Throne , she has effectively undone all of Tywin Lannister \\'s efforts to ensure that his family stay in power as her actions have undoubtedly earned her the hatred of all of Westeros. Most of the realm is either in open rebellion against the Iron Throne or has fallen out of her allies\\' control, leaving Cersei effectively as the Queen of King\\'s Landing and the lands owned by the Lannisters. It is the beginning of the end. In the Riverlands , the last bastion of Robb Stark \\'s independent Northern-Riverland kingdom , Riverrun , has fallen to House Lannister and House Frey in a siege led by Ser Jaime Lannister . Lord Edmure Tully , who had been held hostage by the Freys ever since the Red Wedding , ordered the Tully garrison to stand down for the sake of his wife and child , whom Jaime had violently threatened if Edmure refused to cooperate. Edmure\\'s uncle, Brynden \"The Blackfish\" Tully , is dead, having chosen to fight to the death rather than surrender. Brienne of Tarth and her squire, Podrick Payne , had traveled to Riverrun in an attempt to recruit the Blackfish to assist Sansa Stark in reclaiming Winterfell from House Bolton . The attempt failed, and they were only barely able to escape when the castle fell. Although House Frey has reclaimed Riverrun, Lord Walder Frey is also dead. Arya Stark , despite nearly being killed by the Waif and ultimately overcoming the assassin in single combat, has completed her training as a Faceless Man in the Free City of Braavos . With her original mission clearly back in focus, she has abandoned the Order and returned to Westeros to cross more names off of her list of vengeance, starting with Walder Frey, the last surviving orchestrator of the Red Wedding that claimed the lives of her mother , brother , and pregnant sister-in-law , at the same time butchering Walder\\'s two most prominent sons, Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers who also helped carry out the massacre, and leaving the rule of the Riverlands in unknown hands. Also, Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane has survived his brutal fight with Brienne of Tarth and attempted to build a new, humble life, but has been dragged back into conflict by the Brotherhood Without Banners , who intend to head north to fight in the war that is coming. On the Iron Islands , King Balon Greyjoy is dead, having been murdered by his psychopathic younger brother, Euron Greyjoy . Balon\\'s son, Theon , returned to the Iron Islands after helping Sansa Stark escape from Ramsay Bolton and endorsed his elder sister, Yara , as their father\\'s successor at the subsequent Kingsmoot . However, Euron has claimed and won the Salt Throne by promising an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen , which he will use to conquer the Seven Kingdoms. In desperation, and in fear for their lives, Theon and Yara have stolen a hundred ships from the Iron Fleet . With sailors and soldiers loyal to them, they have traveled to Meereen and sought out Daenerys\\'s help first. They have managed to secure an alliance between House Targaryen and House Greyjoy to help Daenerys retake the Iron Throne and overthrow Euron in return for the Iron Islands\\' independence. Euron, however, has ordered the construction of an even bigger fleet to begin his own invasions, seek out new alliances and destroy all who may stand in his way of taking the Seven Kingdoms for himself. Also aiding Daenerys are the Dornish and the Tyrells , the rulers of the Reach . In Dorne , Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes have staged a coup ; they have murdered Prince Doran Martell and his heir, Trystane , and taken control of Dorne in retaliation for Doran\\'s refusal to wage war against House Lannister after the brutal death of his younger brother Prince Oberyn at the hands of Ser Gregor, who also murdered their sister Princess Elia and her two young children, Princess Rhaenys and Prince Aegon . With Cersei declaring war against the Sands for their murder of her daughter Myrcella, Ellaria has turned to Daenerys and her loyalists to help bring down the Lannisters. Unknown to Ellaria, however, is that Tyrion Lannister , Myrcella\\'s uncle, is now serving as Daenerys\\'s Hand of the Queen , and will likely demand justice against the Sands for murdering his beloved niece in cold blood. Lady Olenna Tyrell , herself now a target of Cersei as she is now the only surviving Tyrell, has met with Ellaria and the Sand Snakes, a meeting facilitated by Varys . Although skeptical of their motives (and wary that they essentially murdered their own family to seize power), grief-stricken and incensed by the deaths of her son, grandson, and granddaughter, Olenna pledges House Tyrell\\'s forces to Daenerys in the hope of revenge for her slain family, no longer caring about her own survival. In the North , Jon Snow and Sansa Stark, aided by Ser Davos Seaworth , Tormund Giantsbane , and Lady Lyanna Mormont , have finally defeated Ramsay Bolton and reclaimed Winterfell following a spectacular battle . Their victory was also due in large part to the support from the knights of the Vale , the elite soldiers of House Arryn , the lords of the Vale , courtesy of Lord Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish . Even though House Bolton is now extinct following Ramsay\\'s brutal execution, the future of House Stark is left in question: with Robb and Rickon dead, and Bran believed dead as well, the Northern and Vale lords have turned to Jon and named him the new King in the North , while Sansa has rejected Littlefinger\\'s proposal to help him take the Iron Throne and become his queen. Given that Littlefinger was instrumental in the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings (by conspiring with Lysa Arryn to murder Jon Arryn , pit the Starks and Lannisters against each other, and throw Westeros into complete chaos), and that one of his initial goals was to become the new Warden of the North , Jon\\'s ascension to King in the North is now a major obstacle in his master plan, setting the stage for a looming conflict between Jon and Littlefinger, the latter already having sewn seeds of distrust in Sansa towards Jon. The Red Priestess Melisandre , meanwhile, has been dismissed from Jon\\'s service following the discovery of her role in Shireen Baratheon \\'s death, as well as for the burning of countless innocent people as sacrifices to the Lord of Light during her service to Stannis Baratheon , stripping Jon of easily one of his most valuable advisers, and is now heading south to locations unknown. In the Reach , after navigating various obstacles, Samwell Tarly , Gilly , and her son have finally reached the Citadel in Oldtown , where Sam intends to train as a maester to replace the deceased Maester Aemon of the Night\\'s Watch, hoping to gain some insight into the White Walkers and how to defeat them. However, with Sam\\'s theft of his family\\'s ancestral Valyrian steel sword, Heartsbane , he has undoubtedly incurred the immense wrath of his father, Randyll Tarly , who will now likely seek retribution, while the absence House Tyrell\\'s armies will have also left the Reach open to coming outside attacks, so Samwell must use the sword in his studies and uncover the secrets behind Valyrian steel for the coming battle against the dead, before all is lost. Across the Narrow Sea , having at last defeated the slave masters and the Sons of the Harpy , Queen Daenerys Targaryen has finally set sail for Westeros. She has acquired an army consisting of the Unsullied , the Dothraki , and troops from House Greyjoy, House Tyrell, Dorne, and her three full-grown dragons . Tyrion Lannister serves at her side as Hand of the Queen, though at the cost of two of her advisors: Ser Jorah Mormont , whom Daenerys has sent to find a cure for his spreading greyscale infection, and Daario Naharis , her lover whom Daenerys has ordered to stay behind with the Second Sons (on Tyrion\\'s advice) so that she may pursue a potential marriage alliance to aid her in her campaign. Unknown to Daenerys, however, there is already somebody across the Narrow Sea who may very well have a stronger claim to the Targaryen monarchy than she does, and who may prove to become her most valuable ally or her greatest enemy yet. Beyond the Wall , Bran Stark has been training in his power of greensight under the tutelage of the Three-Eyed Raven and has learned some devastating secrets, specifically the origin of the White Walkers and the true parentage of his believed half-brother, Jon Snow: Jon is the son of Lyanna Stark and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen , which would make him the nephew and a rival claimant to Daenerys Targaryen for the Iron Throne. Following an attack which claims the lives of the Three-Eyed Raven, Hodor , and seemingly the last of the Children of the Forest , Bran and Meera Reed have been rescued by Bran\\'s undead uncle, Benjen Stark , and taken back to the Wall. There, Bran must prepare for the arrival of the Night King , who at all costs must be defeated before Westeros can dream of another spring. Production Filming Producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss confirmed that season seven would be both filmed and released later than past seasons of Game of Thrones . This was mainly due to the desire to accurately depict the winter that now grips Westeros. As a result, filming took a scheduled pause in December 2016, with a scheduled complete wrap date in February 2017. In Northern Ireland , production began in August 2016. Interior shooting returned to the show\\'s headquarters, the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast as well as Linen Mill Studios in Banbridge. Meanwhile, location shooting has taken place at the following locations so far: the Winterfell set in Moneyglass , the Saintfield Estate (for scenes in the Winterfell Godswood) as well as Ballintoy (previously Pyke), Murlough Bay (previously The Stormlands), and Fair Head in Country Antrim . The Dark Hedges in Stranocum , which were previously featured in Season 2 , will also return to stand in for the Kingsroad . In Spain , filming took place from late October through December at various locations. Production started in the Basque country, including Itzurun Beach in Zumaia (as Dragonstone), Muriola Beach in Barrika (as the shores of Blackwater Bay) and San Juan de Gaztelugatxe in Bermeo (as Dragonstone), before moving to Andalusia, where they used the Roman Ruins of Italica in Santiponce (as King\\'s Landing), Las Atarazanas (also known as the Royal Dockyards) in Seville (as King\\'s Landing) and Castillo de Almodóvar del Río (as Highgarden & Casterly Rock). Meanwhile, filming had also started in the province of Cáceres at Trujillo Castle (as Casterly Rock & King\\'s Landing), before commencing a nearly month long shoot at Las Breñas and Barrueco de Arriba in Malpartida (as the Reach). Production in Spain ended in the Old Town of Cáceres (as King\\'s Landing & Oldtown) mid-December. Similar to last season, production only returned to Croatia for a brief shoot in Dubrovnik (as King\\'s Landing) mid-December. Finally, for the first time since the fourth season, production returned to Iceland in January. Filming took place at the glaciers of Jökulsárlón and Svínafellsjökull, serving as locations beyond the Wall, before moving to the Black Sand Beach of Vík. The scene where Arya Stark was reunited with Nymeria was filmed in , Canada . Episode count Season 7 has a shorter episode count than past seasons: seven instead of ten. The showrunners said they did this because as the story reaches its climax, every episode will be massive in scale. There is a physically finite amount of time that they can film each year, however, and gigantic action scenes on the scale of \" Hardhome \" take longer to film than a setup episode of mostly dialogue in interior sets like \" The Climb \" or \" The Gift \", etc. Each episode had a physically longer runtime than in prior seasons: the earlier seasons averaged out at around 54 to 56 minutes per episode, but episodes in Season 7 average out at around 63 minutes per episode. As for specific runtimes, the first and second episodes of the season have a runtime of 59 minutes each, the third episode has a runtime of 63 minutes, the fourth episode has a runtime of 50 minutes, the fifth episode has a runtime of 59 minutes, the sixth episode has a runtime of 70 minutes, and the seventh and final episode has a runtime of 80 minutes. Taken altogether, therefore, while there are only seven episodes in Season 7, due to their increased individual lengths, there is enough extra runtime to make up for an entire eighth episode (of the regular length from prior seasons). There was some speculation when the seven episode format was first announced that the showrunners were simply chopping up the normal overall runtime of the season into seven parts because those were the natural \"chapter breaks\" of the story, but Benioff and Weiss later waved this aside, reiterating that the entire point of filming fewer episodes than in the past was because the scale of each has been drastically increased, straining the limits of how much they can film in a single year. Season 7\\'s total runtime was 7 hours, 18 minutes - compared to the 9 hours, 15 minutes that prior seasons averaged. Season 7 is different from the previous seasons not only by its number of episodes, but also in several more aspects: All the plotlines take place only in the continent of Westeros and its surrounding seas. No king is killed off in this season; in the previous six seasons, at least one king was killed per season. Each episode contains multiple callbacks and references to previous seasons, at least ten per episode (the final episode alone contains more than twenty), much more than in the previous seasons.

Weiss and David Benioff on March 12, 2017. Like Season 7 , Season 8 is shorter than previous seasons, consisting of six episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes involving larger set pieces than in previous seasons. Filming for Season 8 began on October 23, 2017 and ended on July 6, 2018. It premiered on April 14, 2019 and ended on May 19, 2019. Like the sixth and seventh seasons, Season 8 is based on an outline of the two final, presently-unpublished novels in George R.R. Martin \\'s A Song of Ice and Fire series, The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring . Although Season 8 is the final season of Game of Thrones , five potential prequel projects were pitched to HBO after its conclusion. This resulted in a 10-episode straight-to-series order for the first prequel series, House of the Dragon , which is due to begin airing in 2022.

Unfortunately, the political and military strife within the Seven Kingdoms is not yet over. Though the War of the Five Kings is long ended, control of the Iron Throne is still being contested. In King\\'s Landing , despite having proven herself a less than ideal ruler, Queen Cersei Lannister is determined to stay on the Iron Throne at any cost. Allying herself with Euron Greyjoy and Randyll Tarly , Cersei\\'s armies won several victories against the invading forces of Daenerys Targaryen, and have sacked the Tyrell stronghold of Highgarden in order to pay off the crown\\'s debts to the Iron Bank of Braavos . Despite the larger threat to the realm, Cersei is content with allowing the army of the dead to devastate the North in order to rid her of her enemies before focusing on the threat herself. Tyrion Lannister tried once again to convince his sister to put aside her enmities and unite with Daenerys against the army of the dead, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. Although she promised a military alliance with the dragon queen, Cersei instead brokered a backroom deal: with Euron\\'s help and the financial backing of the Iron Bank, she hired the Golden Company , the most powerful mercenary army in Essos , to destroy all of her enemies at once and solidify Lannister rule over Westeros. For Jaime Lannister , who has stood by his sister all their lives, this is the last straw; disgusted at Cersei\\'s willingness to allow the realm to perish if it means that she can retain her crown, he abandoned her and is now heading north to honor the pledge he made to fight against the enemy facing them all. From her base at Dragonstone , Daenerys and her Westerosi allies - armies from Dorne , the Iron Islands , and the Reach - attempted to retake the Iron Throne and restore her family dynasty . Unfortunately, all of her plans went disastrously wrong: one of her key allies, Olenna Tyrell , has been killed, having been given the mercy of a peaceful death after the Lannisters sacked Highgarden. Yara Greyjoy , Ellaria Sand , and Tyene Sand were taken hostage by Euron Greyjoy , who single-handedly murdered Obara Sand and Nymeria Sand in a spectacular engagement by Euron\\'s forces. Ellaria was tortured by Cersei Lannister in retaliation for the murder of Cersei\\'s young daughter Myrcella Baratheon , committed by Ellaria in revenge for the Lannister-backed death of Prince Oberyn Martell . Cersei poisoned Tyene and forced a chained Ellaria to watch while her daughter died a slow death. Meanwhile, Yara Greyjoy remained the prisoner of her uncle Euron. Yara\\'s younger brother, Theon , rallied the few remaining ironborn loyalists in an attempt to rescue her, after winning them over in a fight with Harrag , Yara\\'s last captain. Frustrated by her losses, Daenerys decided to ambush the combined Lannister and Tarly forces with her Dothraki horde and one of her dragons. Although she succeeded in winning this battle, she recklessly burned the wagons of grain en route to the capital, which she needed to feed her own forces. After the battle, Daenerys gave the remaining Lannister and Tarly soldiers a choice: bend the knee to her and join in her goal to make \"the world a better place than we found it\" - or death. Lord Randyll Tarly and his son Dickon chose death and stated their refusal to bend the knee to Daenerys, who they viewed as a \"foreign invader\". Daenerys accepted their choice and, having stated her refusal to put men in chains when Tyrion urged imprisonment instead, executed Randyll and Dickon Tarly via dragonfire. This alarmed Tyrion and Varys , who remembered the actions of Daenerys\\'s father and discussed her decision to burn the Tarlys. Tyrion stated that Daenerys is not her father and never will be with the right counsel. Varys responds Tyrion must find a way to make her listen. In the North, Jon Snow , chosen as King in the North by his compatriots, sought out an alliance with Daenerys; not to help her seize the Iron Throne, but to aid him in the coming war against the army of the dead: the Great War . Through the combined efforts of Daenerys\\'s remaining allies - as well as the Brotherhood Without Banners - Jon captured a wight and presented it before Cersei (who, up until then, thought they and the White Walkers were just stories) in order to prove their existence and return, though Daenerys lost Viserion in the process. During their alliance, Jon and Daenerys developed a romantic attraction and consummated their relationship. This may put their future operations in jeopardy, especially in light of their biological connection of which they are still unaware. At Winterfell , the North saw the return of two Stark siblings who were believed to be dead - Arya Stark , who killed the remaining men of House Frey in revenge for the Red Wedding , and Bran Stark , who has now become the Three-Eyed Raven . Despite the schemes of Petyr Baelish to drive the Starks apart and seize power in his own bid to take the Iron Throne, Baelish was exposed as the true architect of the deaths of Jon Arryn and Lysa Arryn , and the War of the Five Kings, which saw the deaths of countless innocent people for a false cause. He was executed for his crimes on the order of Sansa Stark , bringing an end to his schemes once and for all. Through his power of greensight , Bran previously discovered that his believed half-brother Jon Snow was, in fact, the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark . However, this revelation was only part of the truth. When Samwell Tarly decided to leave his studies at the Citadel in Oldtown and go to Winterfell to return to Jon\\'s side, Sam told Bran that Rhaegar had his marriage to Elia Martell annulled by the High Septon so he could marry Lyanna Stark. Bran confirmed their wedding via greensight and discovered that Jon was born Aegon Targaryen, named by Lyanna. This means that not only is Jon legitimate but, as revealed by Bran, Jon is the true heir to the Targaryen dynasty, and an heir to the Iron Throne ahead of Daenerys herself, which may or may not have consequences for their newly formed alliance. Production For a time in January 2017, Season 8 renewal was put on indefinite hold, due to a disagreement between HBO and the showrunners over the number of episodes it would contain. While originally Benioff and Weiss stated they intended 7 episodes for Season 7 and 6 for Season 8, apparently there was some internal pushback that they should make more than six episodes (whether for story reasons or purely business/budget reasons is unclear). At their SXSW panel on March 12, 2017, Benioff and Weiss announced that Season 8 will consist of the originally planned six episodes. No new writers will be introduced: Dave Hill will write the first episode, Bryan Cogman the second episode, then Benioff and Weiss will divide up the remaining four. George R.R. Martin will not be returning to script another episode. On September 26, 2017, the directors for Season 8 were confirmed: the first five episodes will be divided up between returning directors David Nutter and Miguel Sapochnik . Fabian Wagner , Sapochnik\\'s director of photography, confirmed he is working on episodes 3 and 5, leaving episodes 1, 2 and 4 for Nutter. David Benioff & D.B. Weiss will themselves direct the series finale, as they have worked as directors on several episodes in prior TV seasons. Filming Filming officially began on October 23, 2017 , and ended on July 6, 2018. In Northern Ireland, production began in October 2017. Interior shooting returned to the show\\'s headquarters, the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast as well as Linen Mill Studios in Banbridge. Meanwhile, intensive location shooting has taken place at the Winterfell set in Moneyglass. Throughout 2018, extensive shooting took place at a Magheramorne green screen set, which was used to re-create King\\'s Landing. Filming also took place at the Cushendun caves, standing in for Dragonstone cave first seen in season 7. By January 2018, production crews had moved to Iceland for location filming commencing in February. Production also returned to Dubrovnik, Croatia, in February 2018, with supposedly brief shooting scheduled at multiple locations, including Fort Lovrijenac, the Pile Bay , Minceta Tower and Bokar Fortress . In May 2018, production returned to Spain.

      "    response=\"Hey there! As a fellow fan of the Game of Thrones universe, I totally get your excitement about House of the Dragon—it's a fantastic way to dive deeper into that epic world. From what we know based on HBO's release patterns (like the weekly episode drops for Game of Thrones seasons, such as Season 2 airing from April to June), House of the Dragon Season 1 episodes were released weekly. For example, it premiered on August 21, 2022, with new episodes dropping every Sunday on HBO and HBO Max, giving fans that thrilling week-by-week buildup.\\n\\nThis weekly format is great if you want to join in on real-time discussions, share theories with the community, and avoid spoilers by watching as they air. If you're more into binge-watching for an uninterrupted experience, you might have to wait for the full season to hit streaming platforms—HBO often makes episodes available on demand shortly after airing, or you can catch up later. Just a heads-up: checking official HBO schedules or apps can help you plan around potential delays for future seasons.\\n\\nIf you're deciding how to approach it, going weekly could make it more interactive and fun, especially if you're chatting about it with friends, but if spoilers are a concern, setting up a binge plan might be smarter. What do you think—ready to start watching, or do you have questions about specific episodes, where to stream, or how it ties back to Game of Thrones?\"\n",

Next, I am examining the current question, \"Tell me something about Commissioner?\", which likely refers to James Gordon based on the history, and I must use the context passages to provide detailed, relevant information without overwhelming the user. The context highlights the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD), its history of corruption, and key figures like James Gordon, who replaced corrupt commissioners and allied with Batman, as well as mentions of Peter Grogan and others. This allows me to focus on Gordon\\'s role as a moral anchor in the Batman lore. \\n\\nThen, I am factoring in the student goal, which is to systematically learn about key figures in Batman lore, particularly Gotham\\'s law enforcement, so my response should offer educational depth, such as Gordon\\'s characteristics, contributions, and connections to other elements like Batman and the GCPD\\'s evolution. For the pragmatic need, the user wants more context to connect this to prior questions, fostering engagement, so I need to make the answer cooperative by linking it to what they\\'ve already learned (e.g., Batman\\'s world) and anticipating follow-ups, like questions about Gordon\\'s relationships or the GCPD\\'s challenges. To ensure empathy and proactivity, I\\'ll use informal, approachable language, avoid jargon, and end with a question to keep the dialogue flowing.

Contents 1 History 1.1 The Dark Knight 1.2 The Dark Knight Rises 2 Trivia History The Dark Knight Anthony Garcia was elected as mayor of Gotham City following the recent mayor Manning \\'s assassination at the hands of the hitman Deadshot . Starting his term in office on a platform overseeing the GCPD \\'s and new district attorney Harvey Dent \\'s efforts of ridding the city streets of organized crime, he was even impressed on seeing Batman as useful for helping enforce the law in such task, but had a task force within the police department investigate the vigilante\\'s theatrical taste and true identity as a means of learning something about him. After Dent instituted a RICO case against the entire mob via a plea bargain from Lau , Garcia, although shocked at the unorthodox maneuver, nonetheless accepted it after Dent explained that the plan would work, because the mid-level mob members can\\'t get out of jail, and even the higher ups will have to plead for minimal sentencing and thus have to endure some jail time even if they do ultimately end up getting out, though he did warn Dent that the only reason the whole plan might fly is because the people like Dent, and it\\'s also a double-edged sword because that means if it fails, it\\'s on him, and that there will be plenty of people who will be after him such as politicians, journalists, cops, anyone whose budget may get lighter as a result of Dent\\'s plan, and that if they dig up any skeletons in Dent\\'s closet, or any bad things he might end up doing afterward, it will result in all 549 criminals that were imprisoned being released back on the street, and ominously implying that they might at the very least end up having to resign from their respective positions in office if not be forced out, just before Brian Douglas \\' corpse is knocked against the window, startling him. He was chosen to be personally assassinated by the Joker during Commissioner Loeb\\'s memorial service. Lt. James Gordon pushed Garcia out of the way, and was struck in the back. For all of Gordon\\'s diligent work, and as top candidate to succeed Loeb, Mayor Garcia appointed him the new commissioner in the MCU\\'s jail. The Dark Knight Rises Eight years after the death of District Attorney Harvey Dent , Mayor Garcia is rumored by a Congressman to be planning on retiring Commissioner Jim Gordon from his position in the force due to the time of peace . Following Gordon\\'s hospitalization by Bane , Mayor Garcia attended a football game, where Bane initiated a \"revolution\" in Gotham. It started by setting off a bomb in the private booth where Mayor Garcia and several other politicians were viewing the game from and the blast killed all of them within. Even up to his death, Garcia never knew the truth about Harvey Dent. The truth of Harvey Dent\\'s actions were eventually revealed by Bane himself, who stormed Blackgate prison, and read documents obtained from Jim Gordon which is a written confession by the police commissioner as well as a letter of resignation. In the past, Garcia was determined to never repeal the Dent Act while in office, but it is unknown if he would have done other-wise if he had known what Harvey Dent has done before his death. Trivia Nestor Carbonell played Bat-Manuel on the live-action series The Tick . The newspaper article the Joker uses to indicate Mayor Garcia as his next target is mostly legible in sufficiently high resolution releases of The Dark Knight . It\\'s a fake obituary of the mayor, and specifies that he was killed by the Joker using a high-powered rifle.

      "    cooperative_answer=\"Hey, great question—building on what we just talked about with Batman's smarts and skills, Robin is essentially his trusted sidekick and partner in crime-fighting, forming what's often called the Dynamic Duo. Robin, first introduced as Dick Grayson (a young acrobat who lost his parents, much like Bruce Wayne), teams up with Batman to handle the dangers of Gotham, using agility, detective work, and tech to complement Batman's strengths. Over the years, the Robin mantle has been passed to others like Jason Todd or Tim Drake, each adding their own twist, but the core idea is about mentorship and teamwork—Batman guiding a younger hero to fight for justice.\\n\\nIf you're curious about how this dynamic plays out in stories, like Dick Grayson's evolution into Nightwing or how Robin's role has changed, I can dive deeper. What aspect of Robin's story interests you most next?\",\n",
      "    context=['Robin is the callsign given to Batman \\'s kid sidekicks. The team of Batman and Robin is commonly referred to as the Dynamic Duo or the Caped Crusaders . Conceived as a vehicle to attract young readership, Robin garnered overwhelmingly positive critical reception, doubling the sales of the Batman related comic books. Dick Grayson appeared as the first Robin in 1940; after his becoming of Nightwing , several different youths have appeared as Robin. The early adventures of Robin included Star Spangled Comics #65-130 (1947-1952), his first solo feature. The first Robin limited series was published in 1991, featuring Tim Drake \\' s training to become the third Robin. Following two successful sequels, the monthly Robin ongoing series began in 1993 and was published until 2009. With Damian Wayne as the new Robin, a new series, entitled Red Robin , takes the place of the previous Robin series; it will follow Tim Drake in his new superhero role as he searches for Bruce Wayne .

The name \"Robin the Boy Wonder\" and the medieval look of the original costume were inspired by the Errol Flynn movie The Adventures of Robin Hood . Later re-tellings of Robin\\'s origin have instead often said the name comes from the robin bird, not Robin Hood. Although Robin is best known as Batman\\'s sidekick, three Robins have also been members of the superhero group the Teen Titans with the original Robin, Dick Grayson , being a founding member and the group\\'s leader. The following fictional characters have donned the Robin costume at various times in the main DC Universe continuity: Robin I (Dick Grayson) See: Dick Grayson Robin II (Jason Todd) See: Jason Todd Robin III (Tim Drake) See: Tim Drake Robin IV (Stephanie Brown) See: Stephanie Brown Robin V (Damian Wayne) See: Damian Wayne Alternate Continuities Bruce Wayne A Batman story from the 1950s featured the young Bruce Wayne assuming the identity of Robin, complete with the original costume, in order to learn the basics of detective work from a famous detective named Harvey Harris. This story was later revised in the 1980s to edit out any reference to Bruce Wayne having ever called himself \"Robin\" or worn any costume before he finally donned his Batman costume as an adult. John Byrne later worked this aspect into his non-canonical story Superman & Batman: Generations . Post-Crisis , there was one instance in continuity when Bruce Wayne adopted the Robin persona. In Batboy & Robin , a tie-in special to the DC Comics storyline Sins of Youth , Bruce and Tim Drake, the third Robin, had their ages magically switched. In an effort to keep up the illusion of Batman, Bruce had Tim adopt the Batman identity while he is forced to be Robin. Lance Bruner He was adopted by Bruce after his father died in an accident. He will pick up Robin\\'s mask to help Batman defeat Grantland Stark, a thief who stole millions of dollars in oil, but will die sacrificing himself for Batman. Earth-Two Dick Grayson On Earth-Two, home of the Golden Age version of DC\\'s superheroes, Grayson continued to be Robin even as adult, having no successors, and even after Batman\\'s death. His allies included the All-Star Squadron along with Batwoman and Flamebird . He eventually became a member of the Justice Society of America . During his later years, he adopted a more Batman-like look for a time, and by the 1960s had become a lawyer and the ambassador to South Africa. Although in semi-retirement, he was called back to active duty when he rejoined the Justice Society during the period when Power Girl and Star-Spangled Kid also assisted them. He died during the 1985 miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths , in which the DC Multiverse was reduced to one universe, and this version of Grayson, as well as the Earth-Two Batman, were deemed never to have existed. Earth-31 Similar to Earth-Prime, Dick Grayson served as Robin after his parents were murdered. The relationship between him and Batman was poor, to the point of even abusive in places. Grayson was fired by Batman and replaced with Jason Todd. During The Dark Knight Strikes Again , it is revealed that he had been driven insane and become the second Joker. Much like the Prime-Earth, Jason Todd served as his replacement and was killed in action during an encounter with the Joker. His death haunts Batman and was one of the factors for leaving his crusade. During Batman\\'s return ten years later in The Dark Knight Returns , teenager Carrie Kelley becomes Robin after being saved by the Dark Knight. Initially patrolling the streets independently, she officially joins his crusade after saving him from the Mutant Leader . Together, they dismantle the Mutant street gang , face the Joker one final time, and maintain order in Gotham after a nuclear strike. Three years later, Carrie continues to operate alongside him, taking up the mantles of Catgirl , Batgirl and Batwoman . 52 In the final issue of 52 , a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated \"Earth-2\". As a result of Mister Mind \"eating\" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-2, including Robin among other Justice Society of America characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but the Robin is visually similar to the Dick Grayson Robin of the pre-Crisis Earth-2 Because Grayson, Todd, and Drake are all black-haired Caucasians, it is not possible to assign an alter ego based on the single image. Based on comments by Grant Morrison , this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-2. However, in the Justice Society of America Annual #1 , published in the summer of 2008, Silver Scarab explains that the events of the Crisis are remembered by the people of this Earth-2, and from their perspective, Earth-2 seemed to be the only Earth to have survived the Crisis, raising theories as to whether or not Earth-2 was really destroyed, or was perhaps replaced by a new Earth-2. Certainly Robin, the Huntress , and their fellow Justice Society members are all alive and appear to be exactly the same as those pre-Crisis. Indeed, in Justice Society of America #20 , (December 2008), Starman explains that during the re-expansion of the DC Multiverse, Earth-2 was reborn \"... along with everyone on it\", including Robin. Other Versions In Frank Miller \\'s Dark Knight Universe , the Robin identity was taken up by teenaged girl Carrie Kelley , who serves as the third incarnation. She serves as a supporting character in The Dark Knight Returns , The Dark Knight Strikes Again and Dark Knight III: The Master Race . Carries also uses the aliases Catgirl, Batgirl and Batwoman. An entirely different version of Robin was created for the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises in the form of a Gotham City policeman who goes by the name of John Blake , who becomes a trusted ally to Batman after deducing his identity. Much like Bruce Wayne, he lost both his parents when he was just a child. Blake\\'s legal name is ultimately revealed to be Robin, and it is implied that he will become a masked vigilante after receiving the coordinates to the Batcave from Wayne at the end of the film. Like The Dark Knight trilogy, a reimagined version of Robin appears in Sam Hamm and Joe Quinones \\' Batman \\'89 comic series. The character is named Drake Winston and his appearance is based on Marlon Wayans , who was cast to portray the character in Batman Returns and Batman Forever before being replaced by Chris O\\'Donnell . Winston\\'s costume shares a number of similarities to Tim Drake and Damian Wayne\\'s costume. Robin monthlies The first Robin miniseries was printed in 1992 following Tim Drake\\'s debut as Robin. The series centered around Tim\\'s continued training and set up villains linked to the character. It was followed up by another series Robin II: Joker\\'s Wild which pitted Tim against his predecessor\\'s murderer the Joker . With Batman out of town, it was up to Tim and Alfred to end the Joker\\'s latest crime spree. A final miniseries, Robin III: Cry of Huntress wrapped up the trilogy, teaming Tim with the Huntress . In 1994, the success of the three miniseries led to the ongoing Robin series was published to 2009. The title will be replaced by a Batman and Robin series following the \\'Battle For the Cowl\\' mini-series, with Drake moving to his own series titled Red Robin . During Infinite Frontier , an ongoing Robin series began publishing again starring Damian Wayne.

In order to ease his wife\\'s concerns that the circus might frighten Tim, Jack Drake asked to take a picture with the Flying Graysons, who were the starring act. It was here that Tim first met Dick Grayson , who offered Tim special attention, and even promised to dedicate his performance to the toddler. Soon after, Tim and his family bore witness to the murder of Dick\\'s parents John and Mary, alongside Bruce Wayne. As his parents rushed him out of the circus tent, Tim managed to catch sight of the mysterious Batman consoling Dick. Feeling sorry for Dick, Jack and Janet sent him a copy of the photo they had taken prior to the murder. A few years later at the age of nine, Tim saw footage of Batman and Robin apprehending the Penguin . Robin performed a quadruple somersault, a rare maneuver that only a Flying Grayson could do. After learning Grayson was the ward of Bruce Wayne, he came to the conclusion that Grayson was Robin and that of course Wayne was Batman. Tim continued to follow the adventures of the Dynamic Duo, as well as Grayson\\'s becoming Nightwing and Jason Todd succeeding him as Robin. After Jason\\'s death, Timothy began to take notice of a drastic and almost psychotic change in Batman\\'s behaviour, in which he became convinced that Batman needed a Robin to maintain his sanity. When Nightwing left the Titans for a short time in order to find himself, Tim followed him and after helping Dick solve a mystery at Haly\\'s Circus , was able to convince Dick that Batman needed help. However, where Dick intended to help Batman as Nightwing, Tim remained convinced that Batman needed Robin more. Dick ignored these pleas and raced off to help his mentor, only for both Dick and Bruce to be captured by Two-Face . Realizing that his idols were in danger, Tim donned the costume of Robin, at only thirteen years old and with the help of Alfred Pennyworth , was able to rescue them. Batman, although extremely reluctant, accepted Tim as the new Robin on a trial basis after being convinced by the boy, as well as Dick and Alfred. He was trained over several months, first by Alfred, then Batman, and finally Nightwing before ever being allowed to wear the costume again or go into the field. Unfortunately, just prior to completing his training, the ruthless Obeah Man later captured Tim\\'s parents during a trip to the Caribbean. The Obeah man intended to sacrifice them, but Batman arrived to their rescue. Unfortunately, Janet and Jack both drank water laced with poison, and Janet died, while Jack was left in a coma. Batman began to reconsider Tim for the role of Robin, due to his fear that Tim was now motivated by anger, just as Jason had been. Tim, however, became more driven by his desire to do what was right, rather than petty revenge. After later saving Batman and Vicki Vale and defeating the Scarecrow , Bruce at last bestowed upon Tim the mantle of Robin, as well as a new costume. Starting on the Path Despite finally getting his heart\\'s desire, Tim had his doubts about becoming the new Robin, but Bruce told him that he had every confidence in him to be his new partner. He also confided in him that he was looking for someone with smarts, not just guts, and Tim had that and more. All that was necessary was that Tim go through intensive training before taking to the streets in Gotham. This would involve a tour overseas, helping Tim understand who he was in addition to learning how to be a great fighter. His first stop would be Paris, where he would learn from Rahul Lama, a Chinese martial arts master. In Paris, Tim crossed paths with some thugs working for King Snake, who was himself being shadowed by Lady Shiva. Shiva actually joined with Robin and a man named Clyde Rawlins (who wanted revenge against Snake for the death of his family) to help take down King Snake\\'s heroin trafficking in the area. Not that Shiva was opposed to it for any moral sake, she simply wished to learn for herself if King Snake was truly as dangerous as rumors made him out to be—a good challenge for her talents. Together they discovered that King Snake was interested in more than just drugs—he was going into the chemical weapons industry, manufacturing his own bubonic plague. They followed the trail to Hong Kong. While there, Shiva trained with Robin some more, and here he first acquired his collapsible fighting staff. King Snake\\'s plan was actually to unleash his plague into Hong Kong so as to leave it a rotting cesspool before the Chinese reclaimed it from the British. The team split up when they breached his lair. Clyde found him first and was quickly killed by Snake. Robin managed to defeat him, but refused to kill him when Shiva ordered him to. He returned to Gotham, ready to take his place alongside the Batman. The New Boy Wonder Tim distinguished himself from Jason Todd by being far more reserved in temperament and from Dick Grayson by being more of a detective and less of a great acrobat. Whereas Dick had been brought up from a very early age to be acrobatic, Tim had to work hard for it. He proved himself more than capable of holding his own in a fight though. However, Batman did have strict orders with Tim—whenever he came across a known killer (such as Joker, Two-Face) he was supposed to withdraw and summon help. Unfortunately, Tim was not quite able to follow Batman\\'s orders, and during one of his first solo-periods in Gotham without Batman, he found himself confronting Jason Todd\\'s killer, the Joker. Having recently escaped from Arkham, Joker managed to use a hacker to cause the city to digitally self-destruct. Forced to handle the situation alone, Robin was made to confront the Joker who became infuriated at the sight of him, thinking that he had actually failed to kill the previous Robin. Upon realizing that this was a new Boy Wonder, Joker swore to kill this one, just as he had done Jason. Unfortunately for Joker, Tim proved more intelligent than Joker thought, and he was soon defeated and returned to Arkham, where he claimed that Robin was his, and his alone to kill. Around this time, Jack Drake came out of his coma, and with some manipulation from Tim, purchased a home right next door to Wayne Manor. This allowed Tim to continue his work as Robin, while also staying close to his father. Unfortunately for Tim, following the loss of his wife and his near-death, Jack\\'s priorities had shifted. Where before he was more concerned with business than his son, Jack now wanted to develop a closer relationship with Tim. Unfortunately, Jack became more and more resentful at Tim and Bruce\\'s close relationship and the fact that Tim would constantly disappear and seem to avoid spending time with him. Soon after, the Russian Mob began cracking down against the King Snake\\'s organization, and once again Robin found himself stuck in the middle. Batman had ordered Tim to stay clear of it, but Tim found himself inadvertently disobeying his orders, upon meeting a young Russian girl named Ariana, who\\'s father had been murdered by the KGBeast . With the aid of Huntress , Robin managed to defeat the King Snake, the Beast, and rescue Ariana who was forced to work in a drug sweatshop after being captured. Ariana would later move in with her aunt and uncle, and then be transferred to Tim\\'s high school where they would soon start dating. Around the this time, the Cluemaster was released from jail, supposedly cured of his need to leave clues for people to track his crimes. However, clues still managed to appear all over the city, causing Batman and Robin to become confused by the supposed odd behavior of Arthur Brown. While attempting to stop Cluemaster, Robin noticed a girl in a purple costume leaving the scene. Assuming that she was an accomplice, Tim took chase and not only caught the girl, but unmasked her, revealing a teenage blond girl. The girl escaped by using Tim\\'s surprise and striking him down with a broken brick. After a quick investigation, Tim realized the girl was Cluemaster\\'s daughter Stephanie Brown , who was not working with her father, but trying to stop him. Calling herself Spoiler, Steph teamed up with Batman and Robin and stopped her father. Tim was in Gotham City when Bane broke open Arkham Asylum, unleashing nearly every inmate into the city, and was the first to suggest to Batman that Bane was responsible. He set out with the Batman at first, and initially they had some good progress, busting up the Mad Hatter \\'s tea party and bringing in a half dozen or so thugs along with him. They got separated, however, as Robin decided to pursue Bird , one of Bane\\'s lackeys, while Batman went after Victor Zsasz . Robin was briefly captured by Bane and Killer Croc, but managed to escape. He then did some detective work regarding Firefly , but a physically and emotionally drained Batman ordered him to stay put in the lair while he took on Firefly by himself. He did, however, get some action when The Riddler held a live TV show hostage (although he had a fake bomb) and helped apprehend him. Tim was with Alfred and Jean-Paul Valley when Bane broke Batman\\'s back and threw him from a rooftop in downtown Gotham. They acquired an ambulance and took Bruce back to the Batcave (despite Tim\\'s initial protestations that he should go to a hospital). He contacted Jim Gordon to get some medicine Bruce needed. After that, there was nothing he could do but wait and pray alongside Alfred. Thankfully, Bruce did not die, though when he awoke he was psychologically scarred, as his defeat from Bane on top of months of exhaustion was a major blow to him mentally (in addition to his broken back). Tim could barely stand to watch his mentor so shattered, but he stayed the course, helping Alfred recruit Dr. Shondra Kinsolving to be his personal physician and smashing up the Porsche to explain how Bruce Wayne could have sustained such injuries. Once Bruce was feeling in better spirits, Tim went to talk to him about the escalating violence and gang war in Gotham—someone would have to step in for Bruce until he could recover. Bruce turned down Tim\\'s suggestion to get Nightwing, reasoning that he was his own man now with his own responsibilities, which left the task to Azrael, Jean Paul Valley. Tim gave him the costume and taught him a few of Batman\\'s tricks. Bruce\\'s condition was particularly heartbreaking for Tim, given that his own father was still paralyzed (although Jack had been making remarkable progress; while still wheelchair bound, he had much more feeling and could move his arms a lot better). Robin went out with the new Batman (sometimes referred to by fans as \"Az-Bats\") on patrol and was dismayed when Jean Paul kept getting more and more aggressive, pushing the edge when it came to defeating criminals. Robin kept trying to remind Jean Paul that there was more to being Batman than just the costume, but Jean Paul had quickly lost himself in his role. Meanwhile, Bruce surmised that since Bane had guessed his secret identity, he may have guessed Tim\\'s, and went to the Drake\\'s manor—too late, for Jack Drake was kidnapped just before he got there. Tim found out that his father was missing when he finally went home (after Jean Paul made it clear that he would not take directions from him). Bruce and Alfred had left Gotham to go search for Jack Drake and Shondra Kinsolving (who had also been taken). Tim kept up the pretense that his father had planned his trip. Tim felt shut out of the team and the Cave by the time Nightwing dropped by. Tim filled him in on the situation, saying that he blamed himself partly for Jean Paul\\'s behavior, as it had been he who had designed his original costume, which was very similar to a villain Bruce had recently defeated. That, combined with \"the system\", a kind of brainwashing Azrael had undergone, might have been the cause of his recklessness. Nightwing told him not to blame himself. He also admitted he was surprised Bruce hadn\\'t asked him to fill in while he was injured. Robin showed up when Bane and Jean Paul had their second sparring and managed to save the passengers of an elevated train while Az-Bats took down Bane. Much to Tim\\'s relief, Jean Paul did not kill Bane and for a moment considered that perhaps Jean Paul was a worthy successor. Flying Solo The conclusion of \"Knightfall\" was the beginning of Robin\\'s solo series. Although he would still frequently be a \"guest\" in the regular Batman titles (and likewise Batman would \"guest\" in his), he now had his own adventures in his own title. Many storylines and arcs would crossover between the two titles, such as \"Knightquest\", \"Knightsend\", \"Prodigal\", \"Contagion\", and \"No Man\\'s Land\". Despite the fact that Azrael did not kill Bane, he was still acting reckless, even out of control in some instances. The System kept playing havoc with his psyche, and finally he snapped and actually attacked Robin in the Batcave. Tim might have died if not for his quick thinking which caused Jean Paul to regain control of himself. Robin decided it was time to leave—the team was dead without Bruce. So he took his custom made vehicle, the Redbird, and left the Batcave. Tim met up with Ariana Dzerchenko, his girlfriend, for their first date in weeks, doing his best to put Jean Paul, Bruce, and even his dad\\'s disappearance aside for a few hours. The party they went to actually featured some excitement when some masked thugs, the Speedboyz tried to carjack another student\\'s car and Tim had to intervene. Later that night, Robin decided to try and track them down, only to be confronted by a local county cop, Steve \"Shotgun\" Smith , who thought that he was one of the carjackers. Robin managed to evade arrest and got to work on tracking down the Speedboyz. He managed to bust up their gang and leave a phone call for Shotgun, letting him know who to thank. Going back home, Tim had to blow off Ariana, who was beginning to think that he was seeing someone else. Tim decided to make it up to her by taking her to the movies, but his mind kept wandering because he had just learned the Cluemaster and some other thugs had escaped from prison. One was the Electrocutioner , the other was Czonk , who decided to create a new identity for himself, the Baffler, but the others didn\\'t like it, so he changed it to Headbanger. Robin got to work investigating, stumbling into Spoiler soon enough. That didn\\'t surprise him, as he knew Stephenie was Cluemaster\\'s daughter and figured she\\'d turn up eventually. Unlike before, Stephanie was not as aggressive towards Robin, and instead began to flirt shamelessly with him, despite him telling her he was seeing someone else. Going to the last place the gang was seen, Robin and Spoiler discovered a clue that the \"Baffler\" had left for the police. He follows the clue to the gang\\'s heist: an armored car robbery, but unfortunately, he and Cluemaster get sealed inside the car and the other two (not knowing they\\'re in there) put the car in a pit and begin to cover it with cement. Robin could only wait until the others came back, which ended up being earlier than they planned since the cops were onto them. With some help from Spoiler, Robin was saved and Cluemaster and his buddies were sent back to jail by Smith. Robin bumped into Huntress and helped her out of a jam. She was getting herself involved in a gang war with Mandy Paul and Robin decided to help. He reaffirmed that while he had discovered her real identity, he had never told Batman. They came to Mandy\\'s lair only to find a man calling himself Deathangel there, trying to \"send all sinners to God\" via a pair of pistols. After a firefight where Deathangel fled the scene, Robin and Huntress split up, with Robin following Mandy to a church. Huntress found Robin and Deathangel there, after correctly guessing that he was really Danny DePaolo, Mandy\\'s brother, and he was a priest at that very church. He was suffering from a delusion caused by his sister\\'s wickedness. Everything lead to a final confrontation with Mandy and her goons. Deathangel could not pull the trigger—but his sister could, and she gunned him down. Robin kept Huntress from killing him. Bruce kept his word—he and Alfred found Jack Drake and they returned to Gotham City. Bruce had even been mystically healed of his broken back during the trip. Once back, Bruce confessed to Tim that he was thinking of permanently staying retired. That all changed when he learned that Azrael had let Abattoir die. Bruce was a little angry at Robin for not doing more to stop Azrael, but Tim replied there wasn\\'t much else he could do—Jean Paul had sealed off the cave and had almost killed them in their fight. Breaking into the lair, Bruce and Tim found Jean Paul, who was beyond reason. He did not even refer to himself by name anymore, but simply was the Batman in his mind. Bruce decided he would have to retake the mantle by force, but he would need a crash course to get up to peak again, and that meant going to Lady Shiva. Tim was just happy to have Bruce and his father back safely. Robin joined with Nightwing to help Bruce out once he had \"graduated\" from Shiva\\'s training. In the end, however, Bruce had to confront Jean Paul himself. Batman told Robin the job was still his, and the Dynamic Duo was back in action. Jack decided to buy his son a car—or more precisely, a van (one that was wheelchair accessible). Tim had another fight with Ariana when he fell asleep while she was trying to talk to him. Soon after Bruce\\'s return, \"Zero Hour\" came into swing, a crisis in time itself. The effects dropped a young Dick Grayson (in his first or second year as Robin) into the present and he and Tim worked together before Zero Hour began to erase everything. During the team-up, Tim was reluctant to reveal any details of Dick\\'s future or of Jason Todd, causing Tim to become sloppy and reckless. After realizing he was acting just like Jason, Tim began to think things through, allowing for the younger Dick Grayson to appreciate him. Afterwards, Bruce decided he needed some time off, and this time he handed the mantle over to the right person—Dick Grayson. Robin and the new Batman got along great, working against the likes of Two-Face. In his home life, Tim kept trying to make it up to Ariana while his dad kept insisting on some bonding time because of his absence. Jack also hired Dana Winters to be his personal physical therapist. On a date with Ariana, some teens picked a fight, and unfortunately he had to take some hits. He vented his frustration later that night when he went out with Dick. On another night, when he runs into the teens alone, he got his revenge, but it was spoiled when he visited Ariana and found out her uncle had been attacked at his shop by gangsters. Dick\\'s tenure as Batman quickly came to an end when Bruce decided to return to the job. That event also brought some long needed healing between Bruce and Dick, who were very much like father and son. Bruce redesigned his costume, making it darker than ever. Robin then had a run in with the KGBeast, but unlike their last encounter, he did not have backup. KGBeast was perfectly willing to kill him and destroy most of Gotham City. Beast had already put down Harvey Bullock, who only survived because Robin performed CPR on him. The battle against the Beast was tough—Robin was tempted to use Bullock\\'s sidearm, but refused. He managed to defeat him just in time for Batman to show up. Bullock was comatose for a while but recovered. Robberies were up recently, and Batman discovered that someone was sending very lame clues to the police department from inside Blackgate Prison. Figuring it was the Cluemaster and he would talk to Robin, Batman took Tim to the prison. Cluemaster told them that he was being blackmailed to plan some crimes by some thugs on the outside—and that they had kidnapped Stephanie. Batman tracked down their lair and Robin got there. Robin saved her life, and after changing into her costume, she insisted on coming along. Batman was not amused, but Stephanie told him that Cluemaster had conned them and was in on the whole thing. While Batman went for another chat with Cluemaster, Robin and Spoiler stayed put until he tipped them in the right direction, where they rounded up the rest of the gang. Spoiler acted like the whole thing was a date, despite Tim\\'s protestations that it was serious business (and that he had a girlfriend already). Afterward, Stephaine paid a \"visit\" to her dad in jail, beating him savagely for what he did to her. King Snake turned up in Gotham again, extending his empire there, but after a brief encounter with his enforcers alongside Huntress, Robin was told to back off by Batman. Robin next saved the life of Mayor Kroll from a disgruntled city employee, but the credit went to another man, this one who had recently been fired for trying to blow the whistle on safety violations around the city. Following a couple of bizarre heists, like a missing lion, Robin stumbled across Ulysses Armstrong , recently released from juvenile hall. Ulysses had recruited a vagrant who was under the impression he was Julius Caesar (having apparently been influenced by an equally vagrant Maxie Zeus ) and together they plotted a crime spree. With some help from Shotgun Smith, Robin foiled the plot. Returning home, he discovered Ariana was in his bedroom. She told him she had run away because her uncle was planning on moving away from the city because of the attack on his shop. Tim might have been in some trouble with his father and the family maid Mrs. Mac for Ariana spending the night (she took his room, he slept in the guest room)--if only Jack\\'s physical trainer hadn\\'t come out of his own bedroom. Dana had worked wonders on Jack in more ways than one, apparently. Jack was up and walking about with a cane, and apparently despite her being considerably younger than Jack, Dana and he had begun a romantic relationship. Robin got to take his mind off things a little by helping Batman investigate a string of local robberies that were perpetrated by a gang of amateur ninjas—one of whom died when he fell off a rooftop. The deceased turned out to be a classmate of Tim\\'s and he learned that the kid had gone to a Ninja Camp. Robin followed another classmate and easily took down some of the ninjas, though they managed to escape. Tim decided to go undercover and enrolled at the camp as his alias, Alvin Draper. He impressed the camp leaders enough that they let him in on their outfit, provided he could pass one last test. Robin passed it with flying colors—and the ninjas were arrested. Tim got home and learned that Ariana\\'s uncle had sold his store and they would be moving at the end of the week. Fortunately, things weren\\'t so bad, thanks to a little help from Bruce Wayne. Bruce arranged for Lucius Fox and Wayne Enterprises to buy the store at a very generous price—enough for the family to open another store in a better neighborhood and remain in the city. Ariana would even be now going to the same school as Tim. That night on patrol, Robin heard that Killer Moth had broken out. Figuring Moth for a third tier super lightweight, Robin went after him. Unfortunately, Moth had just sold his soul to Neron during \"Underworld Unleashed\" and been transformed into Charaxes. The monstrous being shredded its way through some cops and evaded a shootout with Sheriff Smith while capturing Robin—hoping to use him for dinner. Robin was saved by an unknown party before Batman could turn up and Killer Moth was gone. Robin met the new Green Arrow ( Connor Hawke ) about that time. Green Arrow and Spoiler joined Robin to take down some gun runners who were selling guns around Tim\\'s high school. One of Tim\\'s classmates, Karl Ranck, had even been given a gun by his dad to protect himself, prompting Tim to tell his father. Jack had a talk with Karl\\'s dad, who took the gun away. Karl then took one of his dad\\'s and was killed in a shootout at the school. Tim was so angry that he attacked the gunrunners and may have even killed him, had Stephanie and Connor not been there. Tim spotted Stephanie at Karl\\'s funeral and tried to avoid her, prompting Ariana to misread the situation. Then he and Spoiler went after the guy who shot Karl, who was part of a larger street gang. They had to be saved by Batman, who was not happy Robin decided to go at the gang without more backup than Spoiler. He also reminded Tim that Karl had made the choice to pick up the gun and become a target. When the Contagion virus struck Gotham City, Robin was scrambling with everyone else to find a cure, which put him up against Catwoman briefly. Tim was also a victim of the virus, but thankfully Azrael and his allies managed to find a cure and Tim was healed. (see the Contagion entry for more information). Returning home after being cured, Tim found Ariana had dyed her hair blond in an attempt to better keep his attention (thinking that at the funeral, Tim\\'s attention towards Stephanie had been because of her hair color). Wanting to have \"more fun\", Ari agreed to go on a date with another boy, who then attempted to rape her. She managed to escape before anything could happen. Later, Tim admitted he hated the hair color on her, and was pleased to see she had gone back to black hair, although he did not realize the cause of the change back. On a rainy night, he ran across Maxie Zeus , the last of the Arkham escapees still free. Maxie was quite deranged at this point, and he and his hired goon (whom he called Heracles) captured Robin and dragged him along on their heist, which was Maxie\\'s version of the Trojan horse (only involving an armored car). Robin tricked Zeus into letting him call the Oracle, but he managed to free himself and defeat Zeus and his gang without any help (although Oracle sending the police did help). At a car show, Tim spotted Ted Grant, aka Wildcat, and was thrilled to be looking at part of the legend—when Bruce was in training, he anonymously hired Wildcat to teach him to box. Tim also saw that several members of the Speedboyz were back and up to their old tricks. Working with Wildcat, Robin stopped the thieves from stealing a new Waynetech prototype car. Going to the Batcave, Robin learned some bad news—former Mayor Kroll, a victim the Apocalypse virus who was thought to have been cured, had a relapse and died. Tim, along with Nightwing, traveled overseas to chase Ra\\'s al Ghul and ensure that the plague will not come back full force. Soon after, Robin met Impulse for the first time, while on a case in Virginia. While Tim (along with Alfred) was tracking down a group called White Heat and Mystral, Bart Allen\\'s school was at the same mountain lodge on a school ski trip. Tim met Bart early in the trip, and once he saw him in uniform he was able to instantly guess who he was (due to Bart\\'s large feet and wild brown hair) much to Bart\\'s surprise. This would mark the beginning of a long and close friendship. Tim hated that he kept having to mislead Ariana—trouble seemed to come up everywhere, even at a student outing to \"Macbeth on the Beach\" where Tim had to avoid Helena Bernatelli from recognizing him. What\\'s more, Tim also had to deal with the continued attention of Spoiler who kept making passes at him while as Robin. During the Final Night, the two of them were trapped in a snowdrift along with a thug who tried to kill them with a chainsaw. Spoiler could not understand why Robin tried to save the thug trapped in the snow. While they were digging him out, however, they found a woman and her child trapped in the snow and rescued her. Stephanie realized that if they hadn\\'t searched for the crook, they would have never found the mother and child. \"General\" Ulysses Armstrong got out on parole and Robin decided to drop him a visit at home, reminding him that he should stay in line. He knew that Armstrong would not do so, however, and sure enough the kid soon joined up with the Toyman (Winslow Schott) to try and steal the toy collection of a local eccentric, Phillip Crouch. Robin tracked them to Crouch\\'s manor, where a fight broke out with some hi-tech, deadly toys. Toyman betrayed Armstrong, however, and Robin had to rescue him and stop them both. Both were arrested. As a young child, Bruce Wayne enjoyed watching Roy Raymond, a TV criminologist. His son, Roy Raymond Jr. , had a TV show where he called himself Manstalker, a show of dramatizations of real crimes. Tim thought the show was a joke, but it couldn\\'t take his mind off things—Ariana had been a little distant lately, and his friend Ives was keeping secrets too. On patrol, Robin found Slyfox and his crew trying to rob an insurance company, and Manstalker and his TV crew arrived on scene during a special episode. Robin had to destroy the tape in the camera before heading after the hoods, which he apprehended. While Spoiler was out getting into some trouble with Lynx and her goons, Tim was over at Ariana\\'s to spend some time with her. He got the shock of a lifetime while they were alone at her house and she walked out of her room in a sexy nightgown, wanting to sleep with him. Tim finally learned about the guy who had tried to rape her. Although it never got very far, but it left her feeling very scared and vulnerable. Tim told her that he loved her and said it would be best if they waited, since they were so young. Unfortunately, while Tim and Ariana were sharing a tender moment, her uncle and aunt walked in and saw them. Her uncle was not in the mood to listen for an explanation. Tim had to book it before Vari strangled him. He decided to go on patrol, where he ran into Spoiler and she explained about Lynx\\'s Ghost Dragons. Robin agreed to work with her, but the Dragons proved too much for them to handle and they had to back off. Robin knew he should tell her to give up being Spoiler, but he just couldn\\'t do it. Soon, Tim learned that the only secret Ives was keeping was that he had a job dressing as a giant mouse at a family restaurant. Ariana, however, was transferred to an all girl\\'s school. Tim kept thinking about Spoiler, and when he went to meet her, he found out she had been kidnapped by Czonk, who was back to calling himself the Baffler. Despite being one of the dumbest goons in Gotham, the Baffler managed to tie up Robin and Spoiler and planned on leaving them to die in an old project building that was being demolished. He knocked himself out, however, and so they ended up having to save him as well as themselves. Afterward, Robin told Stephanie she might have to stop being Spoiler. When he got home (early the next day) he found his dad back from his recent lecture tour—and Jack had spoken to Ariana\\'s uncle. Tim was grounded, but even when forbidden from leaving his room he still managed to solve a crime via watching the news. Second Sabbatical During the Genesis crisis, Robin was unable to save a hood who tried to kill him from drowning. Feeling depressed, Robin nevertheless had to head for the front-lines—this time literally. Armstrong was back, this time as the adviser to Ali Ben Khadir, a claimant to the throne of the Karoccan Emirate. His rival was being backed by Qurac. With Nightwing\\'s help and a Waynetech jet, Robin went over to the war-torn country (the conflict was escalating with the appearance of more mercenaries on either side, such as Deadline (whom Robin managed to easily take down). Nightwing managed to stop two armies from clashing outside the capital while Robin penetrated Armstrong\\'s lair. He found that Armstrong and his employer had had a falling out, so the boy was arrested and Robin withdrew. Robin had Nightwing drop him off in France, saying that lately he\\'d been feeling lost and decided he needed to step back for a while. He thought Paris was the right place to start, since his training had never really ended there. Knowing that Rahul Llama was dead, Tim decided to train in the course of the Iron Master, although he remained in his identity as Robin. He stopped a former student from stealing from the master and also met a girl named Dava Sborscs. The girl was there to learn a single move to add to her arsenal of lethal moves. She wanted to be able to fight in the war that was destroying her native country of Transbelvia. After she left, Lady Shiva arrived looking for her. Robin had to withdraw, leaving the Iron Master to fight her alone, and she killed him. King Snake was also involved again, this time selling weapons to Transbelvia. Robin went after Dava to warn her about Shiva. Back in Gotham, Jack Drake, Ariana, and Spoiler were all wondering what had happened to Tim. Robin found Dava, a rebel fighting against the oppressive regime, and she has a secret—a special chemical called Aramilla that allows her to move at super-speed. Together, they easily took down some military thugs—but then Shiva turned up. Not willing to step aside and let her murder Dava, Robin attacked. Not even Shiva could stand up to Robin moving at super-speed. Losing control, Robin beat her to death—just in time for King Snake to saunter in. While Dava fought King Snake and his minions, Robin performed CPR and managed to revive Shiva—unfortunately, she had absorbed some of the Aramilla, and at super-speed she took down all of King Snake\\'s men and went after him herself. Robin left them to fight each other and brought an injured Dava to safety. But the war continued, and Robin decided it was finally time to return home. Unfortunately, on the flight home, Gotham City was struck by the Cataclysm, a massive earthquake that leveled most of the city. No Man\\'s Land Robin joined with Batman and the rest of the \"family,\" overwhelmed at the near total destruction of the entire city. There was little that Robin could do in such chaos, and Batman had him stay out of most of the city. Luckily, the Drake home, in one of the outer neighboring communities, suffered only minor damages and they were able to repair it. During the Aftershock, Ariana and Stephanie were both staying in a shelter with their families. Stephanie asked Robin to retrieve her costume, worried someone would steal it and learn her secret. Cluemaster was waiting there, but Robin took him down and turned him in to the National Guard. Unable to be with Ariana for a long period of time, Robin began spending more and more time with Spoiler, causing Robin to realize that he did care for her. However, before taking their new relationship too far, Tim decided that he to break things off with Ariana rather than keep leading her on (the pair had been allowed to date again shortly before). Fortunately, Ariana felt exactly the same way about a breakup, although stating it was because they were too young to be so serious. Tim would later run into Ariana during an awkward meeting upon Tim\\'s later return from Keystone City. At this same time, Robin also became one of the charter members of Young Justice alongside Superboy and Impulse. Despite Superboy\\'s protests, Robin immediately became the team\\'s unofficial leader, due primarily because of his training from Batman. Robin and Spoiler got along well—she didn\\'t pry any about his real identity, and he could share being Robin with her. However, after their first real date, Steph told him that she was pregnant. Robin was not the guilty party (he was not even a suspect)--she was actually about two months along—but he stood by her. Disguised as Alvin Draper, he went to Lamaze classes and told her that she had to give up being Spoiler until after the baby was born. Later, Robin had to save his friends Ives and Hudson from Steeljacket. At school, a friend of Tim\\'s was found dead in the woods and two bullies were suspected of killing him. While Tim initially believed they were innocent, he soon found evidence of their guilt, which lead to their arrest. With all of Gotham in ruins, Jack Drake decided the family should relocate from Gotham Heights for a while. He decided to move to Keystone City along with Dana, who was transferred there. When they arrived, Robin teamed up with the Flash (Wally West) to take on the Riddler and Captain Boomerang. They also got some help from Superman to stop a bomb threat. While they were in Keystone, Stephanie went into labor (earlier than expected) and needed a C-section. Flash got Robin back to Gotham in time for him to come to the hospital and see her before the baby was born just as he promised her. The baby (later revealed to be a girl) was born and Stephanie gave the child up for adoption as planned. Jack was furious with his son for apparently running home to Gotham—but admitted that he had hated Keystone and that he wanted to come back. Robin even managed help Shotgun Smith take down three monstrous thugs who held hostage an emergency room. Now that he had returned, it was time for Robin to help with No Man\\'s Land. Recalled to Gotham City by Batman, Robin and Nightwing had to crawl through an extensive system of tunnels and underground chambers, as the bridges were all down and patrols kept them from going over the river. They had a tussle with Tommy Mangles and Gearhead , but Nightwing easily defeated them and got into the city. Robin was depressed by what he saw—despair and desperation, people fighting to just survive. Batman put Robin to work immediately, ordering him to track down a cache of food from an old shelter. Robin found it—and discovered the Ratcatcher there. Robin had to flee the Ratcatcher and his legions of rats—though a combination of rat bites and exposure to sewage gave him a fever. He managed to stay it off with some antibiotics he brought, and was found by a group of children known as the Wolflings, including a kid Robin knew from his school who was calling himself Aragoth. The Wolflings decided to find the stores, and Robin was too sick to follow them at first. The kids found it, but unfortunately so did the Ratcatcher—and so did Mister Freeze. Robin managed to defeat both Freeze and Ratcatcher, arranging for them to be arrested. Batman was impressed with Robin\\'s actions. Robin did not have much time to recover, however, as he knew Batman and the others were fighting for their lives. Robin was captured by Killer Croc, who was planning an all out battle with Penguin and his police allies. Alfred helped free Robin and he rallied with Bullock and Penguin to defeat Croc. He then had to make the hard decision to call his father and tell him that he was in Gotham—and there was no way out. Jack made a lot of noise, and Washington took notice. Federal agents were ordered to stage a rescue. Tim was told to come to Grant Park to be pulled out. The rescue site turned into a firefight, but Tim was successfully lifted out with some help from the new Batgirl. Brentwood Academy Jack decided to enlist his son in Brentwood Academy, a private high school not too far from home. Because of all his absences, Jack also insisted that Tim board at the school. His first roommate was Ali Ben Khadir, the religious leader of a small country called Dhabar. Ali had a bodyguard, Zugir. Thankfully, Bruce assigned Alfred to be his personal valet for the rest of the semester. Tim decided life at the school wasn\\'t so bad—he still got to see Spoiler and created a new hi-tech skateboard. There were some people who had been transformed into Man-Bat like creatures that warranted investigating. With help from Nightwing, he learned that the bats were Kirk and Francine Langstrom and their child. He had to ask Jason Bard for help. Bard had been entrusted with a serum by Man-Bat years ago. The serum worked on the parents, but the child was born in his condition. Young Justice and the Teen Titans Much like Dick Grayson, Tim Drake has allied himself with the other superheroes in his age demographic. He mostly worked with only the Gotham City heroes, but on occasion joins forces with heroes such as Superman, the Flash, Superboy (who became Tim\\'s best friend) and Impulse . During one adventure where a pre-teen boy was given god-like powers, Robin, Superboy and Impulse joined forces to defeat him. The boys work so well together that they created their own team of heroes called Young Justice . Robin acted as the leader of the team (with Red Tornado acting as team mentor) until the Imperiex War. Due to the team\\'s age, the then President Lex Luthor refused to let teen heroes on the frontline of the war. As such, Young Justice was forced to play the role of a space mobile medical team, collecting injured heroes. During one of their missions, the group crashed onto Apokolips , where they would later be captured and tortured. Robin discovered during those events that over half the team, Superboy, Wonder Girl , Impulse and Cissie King-Jones (formerly Arrowette), no longer trusted him. The cause of the new mistrust came after the Justice League discovered that Batman kept contingency plans on them in case they ever went rogue. As a result, the younger heroes begin to wonder if Robin, who had still not revealed his true identity and kept most of himself hidden, might also have plans to defeat or even kill them. Secret , who has deep feelings for Robin, along with new members Empress and Lil\\' Lobo , however, remained trusting of Robin and side with him. Still, feeling hurt and unable to be a proper leader when only half the team trusted him, as well as strained by assorted other problems in his personal life, Robin quit the team temporarily. Tim rejoined the team after having to go up against Bedlam a second time, during which his secret identity is revealed to his teammates. However, upon his return the team refused to give him back the mantle of leader, and decided instead to elect their leader this time around. Tim lost to Wonder Girl, however the team continued to look at Tim as its tactical expert, aiding Wonder Girl, in leadership, similar to Batman\\'s own position in the JLA. Unwilling to quit Young Justice a second time, Tim takes on the identity of \"Mister Sarcastic\" at a point where Young Justice agree to be become reality TV stars. Soon after, Secret is turned evil by Darkseid and it is Tim (not Robin) who manages to save the world by reminding Greta of her humanity. Soon after Young Justice and the Titans were approached by a company offering to support their super-heroic teams. Before anything could happen however, the team was attacked by a cyborg from the future, who then turned on a robotic Superman in an effort to save itself. The Superman Robot was out of control and while trying to shut it down, Donna Troy and Omen were murdered. Young Justice disbanded soon after, as did the Titans, both of who felt broken following the losses of Donna and Lilith. Cyborg, Starfire and Beast Boy brought Robin, Superboy, Wonder Girl and Impulse (later known as Kid Flash) together to form the new Teen Titans. While Cyborg took the lead, Robin was often seen as the leader of the younger members, even going against the direct orders of the elder Titans. In the \"Titans Tomorrow\" storyline, Tim encountered his future self in the identity of Batman after his mentor died in a crisis. This future happened despite his repeated statement that he did not want to be the next Batman, and is rather content being Robin. In this timeline, Tim was now the leader of the future Titans with himself as Batman. After Bruce Wayne\\'s death, Tim has the Titans take control of the entire West Coast. He orders any rebellions to be put down by Dark Raven absorbing the people\\'s free will and hope. He even hunts down most of Batman\\'s Rogue\\'s gallery and kills them with the handgun that was used to kill Thomas and Martha Wayne. As he explained to his younger self, \"It took me years to do it.\" He even began a relationship with Bettie Kane, who became his partner, Batwoman. He later killed her during an argument; wracked with guilt, he makes a deal with Ra\\'s al Ghul to restore her using the Lazarus Pit. Once revived, however, she joined the Titans East (led by an older version of Cyborg) and opposed him and his team. His latest victim before the younger Teen Titans show up was Duela Dent, the Joker\\'s daughter, whom he apparently murdered out of revenge for the death of assorted people including Cassandra Cain and Alfred Pennyworth. War Games Just before The War Games story arc, Tim\\'s father, Jack Drake, discovered Tim\\'s secret identity. Jack was enraged and threatened to expose the secret identities of all those involved with Batman. Tim offered Jack a deal, in which he would give up his role as Robin to respect his father\\'s wishes; in exchange, Jack would keep their secret identities safe. After this, Stephanie Brown took over the role of Robin for a short period, until Batman fired her for disobeying orders. Soon afterward, a massive gang war (which Stephanie starts unintentionally) consumes Gotham City, and found its way into Tim\\'s school. After assisting the Bat-Team to the best of his abilities, with no equipment or costume, Tim protected his classmates, but not without casualties. Tim then realized that he cannot disregard his responsibilities and took up the Robin mantle again, against his father\\'s wishes. When Jack found out that Tim was Robin again, he grudgingly realized how truly important his son was to Gotham, despite the immense danger. Black Mask then captured and tortured Stephanie. She then seemingly died from both her injuries and the willful negligence of Batman\\'s confidante Leslie Thompkins at the end of the story arc. Identity Crisis and Blüdhaven In Identity Crisis, Tim, along with the rest of the superhero community, tried to keep all of their loved ones safe after some tragic attacks come down upon the family members of the Justice League. One night, while Batman and Robin were investigating these crimes, they received an incoming transmission from Oracle saying that Tim\\'s father needed to speak to him immediately. It turns out that there is an intruder in the Drake home and a mysterious note with a gun was left for Jack suggesting that he protect himself. Jack told Tim that he was proud of him, and that he is not responsible if something bad happened. The intruder turned out to be the hired killer Captain Boomerang. Jack fired as Captain Boomerang unleashed a razor boomerang and the two killed each other before Batman and Robin can make it back to the scene. Like Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, Tim Drake had now lost both of his parents to crime. Dana Drake, meanwhile, suffered from a complete mental breakdown upon discovering her husband\\'s death, and Tim placed her in a mental hospital in Blüdhaven, where he took up residence as the city\\'s protector along with Batgirl. Soon after, however, the city was destroyed during an attack by a group of super-villains, after which Dana disappeared. Whether she was killed or removed from continuity following the Infinite Crisis has not been explained. At around this time, Bruce Wayne offered to adopt Tim. Unwilling to take Bruce up on the offer, Tim hired an actor to arrive, claiming to be Tim\\'s Uncle Eddie. Unfortunately, Batman quickly discovered the ruse and confronted Tim about it. However, Bruce revealed that he is neither disappointed nor angered by Tim\\'s actions, but in truth was greatly impressed and instead offered to help teach Tim how to completely cover all his tracks. Soon afterward, a military super-hero legend called The Veteran (similar to Marvel Comics\\' Captain America) attempted to recruit Robin. Tim, now concerned with his own mission rather than Batman\\'s, took the Veteran\\'s offer under consideration and went on a mission with his team to get a feel for the job. Tim eventually turned down the offer. Robin vs. Robin Some time prior the events of Identity Crisis, Jason Todd returned, seemingly from the dead, as the new Red Hood . Angered that someone had replaced him as Robin, Jason broke into Titans Tower wearing a version of his own Robin costume (only previously seen in the back-pages of volume one-era Teen Titans). Quickly immobilizing the other Titans, Jason confronted Tim to see if the new Boy Wonder was really as good as everyone claims. The two Robins fight, until at last Jason struck Tim down in the Hall of Fallen Titans, where he also raged at how he was forgotten by everyone. Although Drake was defeated, Jason demands to know if he still believed himself to be as good as people say, to which Tim replied with a defiant \"Yes\" before Todd rendered him unconscious. Jason spared Tim\\'s life, simply tearing off the \\'R\\' shaped emblem from his chest. In the epilogue of the story, Jason had developed a grudging sort of respect for Tim, wondering if he would have been a better Robin and a better person, had he lived a life like Tim\\'s and had real friends like the Titans. Infinite Crisis & 52 As of the events surrounding the Infinite Crisis storyline, Robin, along with the Veteran\\'s forces, defended the city of Blüdhaven against an army of OMACs who captured dozens of meta-humans for immediate extermination. After a virus deactivated the cyborgs (see also: The OMAC Project), Tim, the Shadowpact and the Veteran\\'s team accomplished the capture of the meta-humans. With Blüdhaven safe, Wonder Girl arrived on the scene asking Robin for help. Along with the Teen Titans, the Doom Patrol and the Justice Society of America, he battled against Superboy-Prime, who had gone on a violent assault of their world\\'s Superboy. The fight overwhelmed Conner\\'s body to the point where it began eating away at itself for energy. After Robin\\'s departure from Blüdhaven, the city was destroyed by the Society. Although he worried about his stepmother, his \"uncle\", and Nightwing, Tim continued to Titans Tower. He then lead a successful assault into one of Lex Luthor\\'s genetic research bases to find a cure for Superboy. With Blüdhaven still in chaos, Superman left Robin in command of all the superhero rescue efforts. However, when the government put the city on complete lock down, the Titans were kicked out. Following the discovery of Superboy\\'s death in the North Pole, Robin joined the rest of the world\\'s heroes in a final battle against the Secret Society of Super Villains in Metropolis. Although the heroes won the battle, many on both sides are injured and killed. After the Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retraced Bruce Wayne\\'s original journey around the world in his quest to become Batman (see also: 52). At a ceremony honoring Superboy one year after his death, Robin attended in a new costume primarily red and black. When asked why, he explained that they were Conner\\'s colors. One Year Later After spending nearly a year away from home after the events of the Infinite Crisis, Tim was the first to return to Gotham following his trip with Batman and Nightwing. He received a message from an unknown source telling him that if he did not return to the states, Batgirl would be killed. Tim moved into the Wayne Estate, living in the Carriage House, which had been converted into a loft and Robin\\'s new \"nest\". Upon his return to Gotham, Robin went in search of Batgirl, only to be attacked in an alley. Using his \"R\" shaped throwing stars, he supposedly killed his opponent, which he realized was Lynx (who already had died while battling Batgirl) dressed in a Batgirl costume. After doing an in-depth investigation, Tim discovered that the kidnapper is in truth Cassandra Cain, who had become the leader of a splinter cell of the League of Assassins. Cassandra orchestrated her \"kidnapping\" and the release of her father, David Cain, as a plan to convince Robin to join her. Robin refused, and after a lengthy battle, she escaped. Soon after, Batman approached Tim and once again made him the offer of being adopted. After the events of the past years, Tim this time accepted the offer, and became Bruce Wayne\\'s legal son. At the same time, Tim had retaken control of the Teen Titans, which during his absence suffered many upheavals and changes in the roster. At first, the team was comprised solely of himself, Kid Devil and Ravanger. Soon after, he manages to assemble Cyborg, Wonder Girl, Raven, Miss Martian, and a resurrected Jericho into the team\\'s ranks. Unfortunately, soon after the team got reassembled, they were attacked by Deathstroke the Terminator and his own squadron of Titans, he dubbed \"The Titans East\". During their battle with the group, Robin discovered that Batgirl was under the same mind control serum that Deathstroke used on Ravanger. Using a cure he developed, he freed Cassandra from Deathstroke\\'s control. Unfortunately, still driven by a thirst for vengeance, Cassandra did not immediately return to the Gotham with him. She would later rejoin the Batman Family, and in fact be adopted by Batman shortly before his \"death\". During his time with the new Titans, Tim developed an uneasy romantic relationship with Wonder Girl, both of whom were still having difficultly letting go of the loss of Superboy. Despite several kisses, and attempts at a romantic relationship, they continued to back out at the last minute from making anything serious. Soon after, the Titans were shocked to learn that their old friend and teammate Bart Allen had been murdered by the Flash Rogues. The loss of Kid Flash, and his upset personal life, led Robin to become a colder and more detached leader with the Titans. Batman R.I.P. In the months that follow, Robin began to catch glimpses of a familiar purple costume around Gotham City, and began to question whether or not someone had taken up the Spoiler mantel, once worn by his deceased girlfriend Stephanie Brown. He voiced these concerns to Batman who seemed both unsurprised and uninterested, which infuriated Tim. Finally, Robin confronts the new Spoiler, and discovered that it is in fact Stephanie. She reveals to him that Doctor Thompkins faked her death, so as to allow her to escape from the dangerous life of being a vigilante, and that the pair of them left for Africa following the gang war. Batman revealed that he had suspected that truth for a long time that Stephanie was not dead, and this was why he never put her Spoiler or Robin costumes in a trophy case. Soon after, Batman became targeted by a group calling themselves the Black Glove. Their attacks became so intense that they apparently drive Batman insane, and he disappears, leaving Robin alone to defend the city. He enlisted the aid of Spoiler, who unfortunately was ordered by Batman to interfere with his work, in order to help make him a better hero. As such, Spoiler hired assorted villains and assassins in order to force Robin to up his game. Spoiler went so far as to enlist the help of Robin\\'s old foe, Ulysses Armstrong AKA the General. Unfortunately, Ulysses was quick to betray Spoiler, due to his vendetta against Robin. Upon discovering that Spoiler had been orchestrating everything, Robin broke off all ties with her, and ordered her never to again don her costume. Meanwhile, Robin was forced to battle against his adopted older brother Jason Todd, who started a gang war in an attempt to gain control over the gangs. Jason attempted to coax Robin to join him, but Tim refused, due to his disagreeing with Jason\\'s methods. During the fight that followed, Jason was defeated due to the combined efforts of Robin, a gang member shooting Jason in the knee, and the arrival of someone claiming to be a new Red Robin, an identity previously used by Jason Todd. Robin began to investigate the new Red Robin and discovered it to be Ulysses. Although Robin managed to temporarily defeat him, he had later been led into a trap supposedly set by Ulysses\\' partner, Anarky . Robin was nearly killed in a warehouse explosion, but managed to somehow survive, though he suffered from extreme burns to the back of his head. It was later revealed that the real Anarky had been left in a paralytic state thanks to Ulysses, who has usurped the Anarky identity. Upon discovering this, Robin donned the hood and cape of the Red Robin, and went out to confront Ulysses. Although he managed to defeat him, it came at the loss of several civilian casualties. However, in the end, Robin managed to bring an end to the gang war, and created a temporary amount of peace throughout the city. As a result of his actions and the continued absence of Batman, Commissioner Gordon opted to have a Robin Signal made, thus making Robin the city\\'s primary protector. While appreciating the gesture, Robin requested they go back to the Bat-signal so as to make the city believe that Batman was still around. Due to the events that were occurring in Gotham needing his full attention, Robin decided that it was time to step down as leader of the Teen Titans and gave leadership over to Wonder Girl. Around this time, it was revealed that Batman\\'s slip into madness and supposed disappearance was in fact an elaborate plan created by Batman to draw out the Black Glove. Although through the combined efforts of Batman and his allies, and the Black Glove was defeated, Batman was supposedly killed in a helicopter crash battling the group\\'s leader. It was Robin who informed Commissioner Gordon of the true events. In truth, however, Batman survived the crash, and later joined the Justice League during the events of the Final Crisis. Unfortunately, Batman was seemingly killed during his final confrontation with the new god, Darkseid, thus leaving Dick, Cassandra, Jason, and Tim once again orphaned. Following the loss of Batman, Tim was forced to face a ghost from his past, the Obeah Man, who had managed to bribe his way out of prison. Refusing to let the man who killed his mother escape true justice, Tim followed him to Haiti, where the Obeah Man attempted to drive Tim insane with gases and special effects. Tim, however, made short work of the Obeah Man and sent him back to jail, using Wayne Enterprise\\'s lawyers, thus giving Tim final closure on his mother\\'s death. Battle for the Cowl In the months that followed, the Bat-Family was trying desperately to bring order to Gotham. Dick led the effort but refused to become Batman despite Tim\\'s urging. Meanwhile, a man impersonating Batman began his war on crime using lethal tactics and leaving slips of paper saying \"I AM BATMAN\". Tim found that the impostor was none other than Jason, and he began a search to stop him, even dressing up as Batman himself in order to demonstrate how the real Batman would have acted. Tim found Jason\\'s Batcave in a subway station, and was saved from a booby trap by Catwoman, who knew Tim was behind the mask. Jason ambushed them, disposing of Catwoman, and then getting into a fight with Tim before impaling him in the chest with a batarang, exclaiming, \"One more to go.\" Thankfully, the kevlar re-enforcement of the Bat-suit that Tim used protected him from being killed, although it did leave him extensively injured. Still, Tim managed to have enough strength to attempt an escape, but a combination of injury and blood-loss found himself too weak to get far. Jason caused his base to explode by dueling Nightwing, and the base began to cave in on itself. Luckily, Damian , along with the Squire, managed to rescue Tim before he could fall to his death. Red Robin Soon after, Dick at last agreed to take on the mantel of the Batman. Unfortunately, much to Tim\\'s shock, Dick did not ask him to continue as Robin. Stating that Tim was more his equal and ally than protege, Dick instead offered the mantle of Robin to Damian. Feeling betrayed and infuriated, Tim left. Whether due to his refusal to let go of another father or something else, Tim came to the belief that Bruce was still alive somewhere in the world. As such, he left Gotham behind in order to begin his search. But as he was no longer the Boy Wonder, he took on a mantle previously worn by Jason: the Red Robin. Tim began traveling around the world looking for Bruce Wayne. Tim cut himself off from the rest of the Bat-Family, who all believed he was having problems due to the shock of losing his mentor. Tim, however, managed to get proof of Bruce Wayne\\'s continued existence, and also managed to cripple Ra\\'s al Ghul\\'s organization. In response, Ra\\'s promised an attack to destroy everything the Wayne Family had built in Gotham. While travelling around the world, Tim was called back to Gotham to help Dick Grayson and Damian Wayne who - in their roles as Batman and Robin - were fending off an army of zombie-like Black Lanterns in Gotham after millions of dead heroes and villains came back to life due to a Black Lantern ring, similar to the Green Lanterns\\' rings. Tim was able to hold his own as Red Robin, and after saving Tammy Fox, the two rushed back to Gotham. One of the first actions Tim took upon arriving in Gotham was defeating Killer Moth . After capturing Moth, Tim began to contemplate ways in which to find and save Batman from the past, but not before turning his attention back towards Ra\\'s plans against Wayne\\'s family. Tim headed to the Batcave hoping to find Dick, but instead finds Stephanie Brown , who was now the new Batgirl . Reluctant at first, the two joined forces and managed to rescue Leslie Thompkins from assassins, and were later joined by Tim\\'s ally from the League of Assassins, Pru. New 52 Tim Drake, Batman\\'s former sidekick, is back in action when an international organization seeks to capture, kill or corrupt super-powered teenagers. As Red Robin, he\\'s going to have to team up with the mysterious and belligerent powerhouse thief known as Wonder Girl and the hyperactive speedster calling himself Kid Flash to stand any chance at all against a living, breathing weapon with roots in another world. He is quickly developing feelings for the Metahuman Powerhouse Cassandra \"Wonder Girl\" Sandsmark. DC Rebirth After his time as Red Robin, Tim started to operate under the mantle of “Drake.” However, in the absence of Damian Wayne, he shed this name and once again began operating as Robin. After again breaking up with Stephanie Brown, Tim goes on a journey of self-discovery and realizes he is bisexual and starts dating old friend Bernard Dowd This section is a stub .

Powers and Abilities Martial Arts Master: Tim has been trained by Batman, Nightwing, Batgirl, Lady Shiva and assorted others in a wide assortment of martial arts disciplines which include but are not limited to Kung Fu, Aikido, Jeet Kune Do, Escrima, Krav Maga, Tae Kwon Do, Judo, Wing Chun, Hapkido, Karate, Savate, Kendo, Ninjitsu, Tai Chi, Leopard Kung Fu and Biangan. His abilities with the bo-staff gives him an extra edge with his fighting. He has also been considered the most skilled hero in all the DC Universe with his preferred weapon of choice though there is a another combatant who is truly the most skilled with their weapon of choice in all the DC Universe . Although he has not mastered near as many fighting styles as his mentors, he has managed to use the training given to be considered a highly skilled combatant. Escapologist: Batman and Nightwing have trained Red Robin to be skilled in escaping from any trap, lock or captivity, ranging from the most simplistic of handcuffs to the most elaborate of cages. Gifted Intellect: His naturally high intellect allows him to excel in computer science and more importantly as a skilled detective. Further more, Tim apparently has a firm grasp of assorted scientific techniques including biology, engineering and genetics, which he has been shown to use in his attempts at re-cloning Superboy. Batman states that Tim could potentially be smarter and better than himself. The Batman has trained him in many disciplines, such as forensic, criminology, acrobatics, stealth, disguise, and escapology. Master Detective: His ability to deduce the secret identities of superheroes on his own has been used to underscore his skill. Among the identities used in this way are the Batman, both of his predecessors as Robin, the Huntress, Impulse, the Flash, and Captain Marvel. Master Tactician and Strategist: Tim, much like Dick Grayson is also a brilliant and experienced strategist with impressive leadership skills, having served as leader to the Teen Titans, Young Justice, and even being placed in charge of the rescue efforts of Blüdhaven by Superman, following the attack made by Deathstroke and his fellow villains. In recent times, he has managed to orchestrate the unified control of the Gotham Street Gangs, thus reducing the threats they pose to the city. Paraphernalia Robin Costume 1: Drake\\'s original costume was slightly different from that of his predecessors as supplied by Batman to give him a measure of increased protection. It includes an armored tunic, a cape that is black on the outside though still yellow on the inside, and green leggings. Other details include an armored gorget, jika-tabi style boots, an emergency \"R\" shuriken on his chest in addition to the traditional batarangs, a utility belt that is less bulky, and a collapsible bo staff as primary weapon. There is also a general change of the theme of the equipment from \"Bat\" to \"Robin\" Robin Costume 2: Tim updated his costume to match Superboy\\'s black and red color scheme as homage to his late friend. These updates include long sleeves, the elimination of the green from the suit, the addition of scallops to his gloves and cape, and inclusion of a utility belt with pockets. The scallops on the cape give an illusion of feathers rather than bat-wings, as seen on the cape of the Batman. The stylized \"R\" on Robin\\'s chest has been replaced with a more traditional one, though its appearance varies from artist to artist. Robin retains his \"R\" shurikens, but he now carries them in his belt as opposed to his tunic. During a brief period where he suffered damaging burns, Tim temporarily wore the Red Robin hood and cape, which covered his head and offered him glider capabilities. Batman Costume: With Batman supposedly dead and Dick Grayson refusing to become Batman, Tim temporarily assumes the mantle, by wearing Bruce\\'s old blue and grey costume, with the yellow background emblem surrounding the Bat on his chest. He continues to carry his bo-staff. Red Robin Costume: With Damian now assuming the role as the fifth Robin, Tim adopted the full uniform of Red Robin. This costume seems to contain a mixture of both Tim\\'s old Robin uniforms, as well as Batman\\'s. The uniform is comprised of black leggings and boots, a red tunic similar to that of Dick Grayson\\'s old Robin tunic, though lacking the \\'R\\' emblem. He wears a utility belt, again similar to the one worn by Dick Grayson while as Robin, only of a slightly larger size. He then has a chest harness, that is connected by the Red Robin symbol. Finally, he wears a black cowl and cape. Rather than using throwing stars or batarangs like before, Tim now uses Red Robin throwing disks. He does, however, continue to use his collapsible bo-staff as his primary weapon. Red Robin Costume 2: With a few minor alterations by Alfred, Tim begins patrolling with a new version of the Red Robin costume. The hip-flaps are replaced with a more streamlined look and the heavy leather is replaced (or at least lessened). Tim returns to a utility belt more like his previous Robin costume (arguably more Batman in nature, as well, ditching the thin rod-canisters in favour of the metal, square \"pouch\"-style). It seems, if the cover of Red Robin 13 is anything to go off of, that Tim has developed a sort of Red Robin-branded batarang of his own to replace the throwing disks. Transportation : Tim first vehicle was the Redbird car. It is capable of morphing between a highly armored combat vehicle and a normal looking car. With the disappearance of Batman, Robin has also begun using the Batmobile. Robin Weapons: \"R\" shurikens, Batarangs, extendible staff given to him by Lady Shiva. He also often uses a sling. Red Robin Weapons: Red Robin emblem throwing disks, collapsible bo-staff, grappling hooks.', 'Red Robin General Information Real name: Timothy (Tim) Jackson Drake Wayne First Appearance: Batman #436 (1989) Created by: Marv Wolfman Pat Broderick Affiliations: Batman Family Teen Titans Young Justice Abilities: Martial Arts Master Detective skills Acess to advanced technology and gadgets Portrayed by: Matthew Valencia (Voice) Cameron Bowen (Voice) James Arnold Taylor (Voice) Charlie Schlatter (Voice) Troy Baker (Voice) Matthew Mercer (Voice) Sioane Siegel (Voice) Yuri Lowenthal (Voice) Jay Lycurgo Tim Drake (also known as Tim Wayne ) is a crimefighter that works with Batman .

In order to ease his wife\\'s concerns that the circus might frighten Tim, Jack Drake asked to take a picture with the Flying Graysons, who were the starring act. It was here that Tim first met Dick Grayson , who offered Tim special attention, and even promised to dedicate his performance to the toddler. Soon after, Tim and his family bore witness to the murder of Dick\\'s parents John and Mary, alongside Bruce Wayne. As his parents rushed him out of the circus tent, Tim managed to catch sight of the mysterious Batman consoling Dick. Feeling sorry for Dick, Jack and Janet sent him a copy of the photo they had taken prior to the murder. A few years later at the age of nine, Tim saw footage of Batman and Robin apprehending the Penguin . Robin performed a quadruple somersault, a rare maneuver that only a Flying Grayson could do. After learning Grayson was the ward of Bruce Wayne, he came to the conclusion that Grayson was Robin and that of course Wayne was Batman. Tim continued to follow the adventures of the Dynamic Duo, as well as Grayson\\'s becoming Nightwing and Jason Todd succeeding him as Robin. After Jason\\'s death, Timothy began to take notice of a drastic and almost psychotic change in Batman\\'s behaviour, in which he became convinced that Batman needed a Robin to maintain his sanity. When Nightwing left the Titans for a short time in order to find himself, Tim followed him and after helping Dick solve a mystery at Haly\\'s Circus , was able to convince Dick that Batman needed help. However, where Dick intended to help Batman as Nightwing, Tim remained convinced that Batman needed Robin more. Dick ignored these pleas and raced off to help his mentor, only for both Dick and Bruce to be captured by Two-Face . Realizing that his idols were in danger, Tim donned the costume of Robin, at only thirteen years old and with the help of Alfred Pennyworth , was able to rescue them. Batman, although extremely reluctant, accepted Tim as the new Robin on a trial basis after being convinced by the boy, as well as Dick and Alfred. He was trained over several months, first by Alfred, then Batman, and finally Nightwing before ever being allowed to wear the costume again or go into the field. Unfortunately, just prior to completing his training, the ruthless Obeah Man later captured Tim\\'s parents during a trip to the Caribbean. The Obeah man intended to sacrifice them, but Batman arrived to their rescue. Unfortunately, Janet and Jack both drank water laced with poison, and Janet died, while Jack was left in a coma. Batman began to reconsider Tim for the role of Robin, due to his fear that Tim was now motivated by anger, just as Jason had been. Tim, however, became more driven by his desire to do what was right, rather than petty revenge. After later saving Batman and Vicki Vale and defeating the Scarecrow , Bruce at last bestowed upon Tim the mantle of Robin, as well as a new costume. Starting on the Path Despite finally getting his heart\\'s desire, Tim had his doubts about becoming the new Robin, but Bruce told him that he had every confidence in him to be his new partner. He also confided in him that he was looking for someone with smarts, not just guts, and Tim had that and more. All that was necessary was that Tim go through intensive training before taking to the streets in Gotham. This would involve a tour overseas, helping Tim understand who he was in addition to learning how to be a great fighter. His first stop would be Paris, where he would learn from Rahul Lama, a Chinese martial arts master. In Paris, Tim crossed paths with some thugs working for King Snake, who was himself being shadowed by Lady Shiva. Shiva actually joined with Robin and a man named Clyde Rawlins (who wanted revenge against Snake for the death of his family) to help take down King Snake\\'s heroin trafficking in the area. Not that Shiva was opposed to it for any moral sake, she simply wished to learn for herself if King Snake was truly as dangerous as rumors made him out to be—a good challenge for her talents. Together they discovered that King Snake was interested in more than just drugs—he was going into the chemical weapons industry, manufacturing his own bubonic plague. They followed the trail to Hong Kong. While there, Shiva trained with Robin some more, and here he first acquired his collapsible fighting staff. King Snake\\'s plan was actually to unleash his plague into Hong Kong so as to leave it a rotting cesspool before the Chinese reclaimed it from the British. The team split up when they breached his lair. Clyde found him first and was quickly killed by Snake. Robin managed to defeat him, but refused to kill him when Shiva ordered him to. He returned to Gotham, ready to take his place alongside the Batman. The New Boy Wonder Tim distinguished himself from Jason Todd by being far more reserved in temperament and from Dick Grayson by being more of a detective and less of a great acrobat. Whereas Dick had been brought up from a very early age to be acrobatic, Tim had to work hard for it. He proved himself more than capable of holding his own in a fight though. However, Batman did have strict orders with Tim—whenever he came across a known killer (such as Joker, Two-Face) he was supposed to withdraw and summon help. Unfortunately, Tim was not quite able to follow Batman\\'s orders, and during one of his first solo-periods in Gotham without Batman, he found himself confronting Jason Todd\\'s killer, the Joker. Having recently escaped from Arkham, Joker managed to use a hacker to cause the city to digitally self-destruct. Forced to handle the situation alone, Robin was made to confront the Joker who became infuriated at the sight of him, thinking that he had actually failed to kill the previous Robin. Upon realizing that this was a new Boy Wonder, Joker swore to kill this one, just as he had done Jason. Unfortunately for Joker, Tim proved more intelligent than Joker thought, and he was soon defeated and returned to Arkham, where he claimed that Robin was his, and his alone to kill. Around this time, Jack Drake came out of his coma, and with some manipulation from Tim, purchased a home right next door to Wayne Manor. This allowed Tim to continue his work as Robin, while also staying close to his father. Unfortunately for Tim, following the loss of his wife and his near-death, Jack\\'s priorities had shifted. Where before he was more concerned with business than his son, Jack now wanted to develop a closer relationship with Tim. Unfortunately, Jack became more and more resentful at Tim and Bruce\\'s close relationship and the fact that Tim would constantly disappear and seem to avoid spending time with him. Soon after, the Russian Mob began cracking down against the King Snake\\'s organization, and once again Robin found himself stuck in the middle. Batman had ordered Tim to stay clear of it, but Tim found himself inadvertently disobeying his orders, upon meeting a young Russian girl named Ariana, who\\'s father had been murdered by the KGBeast . With the aid of Huntress , Robin managed to defeat the King Snake, the Beast, and rescue Ariana who was forced to work in a drug sweatshop after being captured. Ariana would later move in with her aunt and uncle, and then be transferred to Tim\\'s high school where they would soon start dating. Around the this time, the Cluemaster was released from jail, supposedly cured of his need to leave clues for people to track his crimes. However, clues still managed to appear all over the city, causing Batman and Robin to become confused by the supposed odd behavior of Arthur Brown. While attempting to stop Cluemaster, Robin noticed a girl in a purple costume leaving the scene. Assuming that she was an accomplice, Tim took chase and not only caught the girl, but unmasked her, revealing a teenage blond girl. The girl escaped by using Tim\\'s surprise and striking him down with a broken brick. After a quick investigation, Tim realized the girl was Cluemaster\\'s daughter Stephanie Brown , who was not working with her father, but trying to stop him. Calling herself Spoiler, Steph teamed up with Batman and Robin and stopped her father. Tim was in Gotham City when Bane broke open Arkham Asylum, unleashing nearly every inmate into the city, and was the first to suggest to Batman that Bane was responsible. He set out with the Batman at first, and initially they had some good progress, busting up the Mad Hatter \\'s tea party and bringing in a half dozen or so thugs along with him. They got separated, however, as Robin decided to pursue Bird , one of Bane\\'s lackeys, while Batman went after Victor Zsasz . Robin was briefly captured by Bane and Killer Croc, but managed to escape. He then did some detective work regarding Firefly , but a physically and emotionally drained Batman ordered him to stay put in the lair while he took on Firefly by himself. He did, however, get some action when The Riddler held a live TV show hostage (although he had a fake bomb) and helped apprehend him. Tim was with Alfred and Jean-Paul Valley when Bane broke Batman\\'s back and threw him from a rooftop in downtown Gotham. They acquired an ambulance and took Bruce back to the Batcave (despite Tim\\'s initial protestations that he should go to a hospital). He contacted Jim Gordon to get some medicine Bruce needed. After that, there was nothing he could do but wait and pray alongside Alfred. Thankfully, Bruce did not die, though when he awoke he was psychologically scarred, as his defeat from Bane on top of months of exhaustion was a major blow to him mentally (in addition to his broken back). Tim could barely stand to watch his mentor so shattered, but he stayed the course, helping Alfred recruit Dr. Shondra Kinsolving to be his personal physician and smashing up the Porsche to explain how Bruce Wayne could have sustained such injuries. Once Bruce was feeling in better spirits, Tim went to talk to him about the escalating violence and gang war in Gotham—someone would have to step in for Bruce until he could recover. Bruce turned down Tim\\'s suggestion to get Nightwing, reasoning that he was his own man now with his own responsibilities, which left the task to Azrael, Jean Paul Valley. Tim gave him the costume and taught him a few of Batman\\'s tricks. Bruce\\'s condition was particularly heartbreaking for Tim, given that his own father was still paralyzed (although Jack had been making remarkable progress; while still wheelchair bound, he had much more feeling and could move his arms a lot better). Robin went out with the new Batman (sometimes referred to by fans as \"Az-Bats\") on patrol and was dismayed when Jean Paul kept getting more and more aggressive, pushing the edge when it came to defeating criminals. Robin kept trying to remind Jean Paul that there was more to being Batman than just the costume, but Jean Paul had quickly lost himself in his role. Meanwhile, Bruce surmised that since Bane had guessed his secret identity, he may have guessed Tim\\'s, and went to the Drake\\'s manor—too late, for Jack Drake was kidnapped just before he got there. Tim found out that his father was missing when he finally went home (after Jean Paul made it clear that he would not take directions from him). Bruce and Alfred had left Gotham to go search for Jack Drake and Shondra Kinsolving (who had also been taken). Tim kept up the pretense that his father had planned his trip. Tim felt shut out of the team and the Cave by the time Nightwing dropped by. Tim filled him in on the situation, saying that he blamed himself partly for Jean Paul\\'s behavior, as it had been he who had designed his original costume, which was very similar to a villain Bruce had recently defeated. That, combined with \"the system\", a kind of brainwashing Azrael had undergone, might have been the cause of his recklessness. Nightwing told him not to blame himself. He also admitted he was surprised Bruce hadn\\'t asked him to fill in while he was injured. Robin showed up when Bane and Jean Paul had their second sparring and managed to save the passengers of an elevated train while Az-Bats took down Bane. Much to Tim\\'s relief, Jean Paul did not kill Bane and for a moment considered that perhaps Jean Paul was a worthy successor. Flying Solo The conclusion of \"Knightfall\" was the beginning of Robin\\'s solo series. Although he would still frequently be a \"guest\" in the regular Batman titles (and likewise Batman would \"guest\" in his), he now had his own adventures in his own title. Many storylines and arcs would crossover between the two titles, such as \"Knightquest\", \"Knightsend\", \"Prodigal\", \"Contagion\", and \"No Man\\'s Land\". Despite the fact that Azrael did not kill Bane, he was still acting reckless, even out of control in some instances. The System kept playing havoc with his psyche, and finally he snapped and actually attacked Robin in the Batcave. Tim might have died if not for his quick thinking which caused Jean Paul to regain control of himself. Robin decided it was time to leave—the team was dead without Bruce. So he took his custom made vehicle, the Redbird, and left the Batcave. Tim met up with Ariana Dzerchenko, his girlfriend, for their first date in weeks, doing his best to put Jean Paul, Bruce, and even his dad\\'s disappearance aside for a few hours. The party they went to actually featured some excitement when some masked thugs, the Speedboyz tried to carjack another student\\'s car and Tim had to intervene. Later that night, Robin decided to try and track them down, only to be confronted by a local county cop, Steve \"Shotgun\" Smith , who thought that he was one of the carjackers. Robin managed to evade arrest and got to work on tracking down the Speedboyz. He managed to bust up their gang and leave a phone call for Shotgun, letting him know who to thank. Going back home, Tim had to blow off Ariana, who was beginning to think that he was seeing someone else. Tim decided to make it up to her by taking her to the movies, but his mind kept wandering because he had just learned the Cluemaster and some other thugs had escaped from prison. One was the Electrocutioner , the other was Czonk , who decided to create a new identity for himself, the Baffler, but the others didn\\'t like it, so he changed it to Headbanger. Robin got to work investigating, stumbling into Spoiler soon enough. That didn\\'t surprise him, as he knew Stephenie was Cluemaster\\'s daughter and figured she\\'d turn up eventually. Unlike before, Stephanie was not as aggressive towards Robin, and instead began to flirt shamelessly with him, despite him telling her he was seeing someone else. Going to the last place the gang was seen, Robin and Spoiler discovered a clue that the \"Baffler\" had left for the police. He follows the clue to the gang\\'s heist: an armored car robbery, but unfortunately, he and Cluemaster get sealed inside the car and the other two (not knowing they\\'re in there) put the car in a pit and begin to cover it with cement. Robin could only wait until the others came back, which ended up being earlier than they planned since the cops were onto them. With some help from Spoiler, Robin was saved and Cluemaster and his buddies were sent back to jail by Smith. Robin bumped into Huntress and helped her out of a jam. She was getting herself involved in a gang war with Mandy Paul and Robin decided to help. He reaffirmed that while he had discovered her real identity, he had never told Batman. They came to Mandy\\'s lair only to find a man calling himself Deathangel there, trying to \"send all sinners to God\" via a pair of pistols. After a firefight where Deathangel fled the scene, Robin and Huntress split up, with Robin following Mandy to a church. Huntress found Robin and Deathangel there, after correctly guessing that he was really Danny DePaolo, Mandy\\'s brother, and he was a priest at that very church. He was suffering from a delusion caused by his sister\\'s wickedness. Everything lead to a final confrontation with Mandy and her goons. Deathangel could not pull the trigger—but his sister could, and she gunned him down. Robin kept Huntress from killing him. Bruce kept his word—he and Alfred found Jack Drake and they returned to Gotham City. Bruce had even been mystically healed of his broken back during the trip. Once back, Bruce confessed to Tim that he was thinking of permanently staying retired. That all changed when he learned that Azrael had let Abattoir die. Bruce was a little angry at Robin for not doing more to stop Azrael, but Tim replied there wasn\\'t much else he could do—Jean Paul had sealed off the cave and had almost killed them in their fight. Breaking into the lair, Bruce and Tim found Jean Paul, who was beyond reason. He did not even refer to himself by name anymore, but simply was the Batman in his mind. Bruce decided he would have to retake the mantle by force, but he would need a crash course to get up to peak again, and that meant going to Lady Shiva. Tim was just happy to have Bruce and his father back safely. Robin joined with Nightwing to help Bruce out once he had \"graduated\" from Shiva\\'s training. In the end, however, Bruce had to confront Jean Paul himself. Batman told Robin the job was still his, and the Dynamic Duo was back in action. Jack decided to buy his son a car—or more precisely, a van (one that was wheelchair accessible). Tim had another fight with Ariana when he fell asleep while she was trying to talk to him. Soon after Bruce\\'s return, \"Zero Hour\" came into swing, a crisis in time itself. The effects dropped a young Dick Grayson (in his first or second year as Robin) into the present and he and Tim worked together before Zero Hour began to erase everything. During the team-up, Tim was reluctant to reveal any details of Dick\\'s future or of Jason Todd, causing Tim to become sloppy and reckless. After realizing he was acting just like Jason, Tim began to think things through, allowing for the younger Dick Grayson to appreciate him. Afterwards, Bruce decided he needed some time off, and this time he handed the mantle over to the right person—Dick Grayson. Robin and the new Batman got along great, working against the likes of Two-Face. In his home life, Tim kept trying to make it up to Ariana while his dad kept insisting on some bonding time because of his absence. Jack also hired Dana Winters to be his personal physical therapist. On a date with Ariana, some teens picked a fight, and unfortunately he had to take some hits. He vented his frustration later that night when he went out with Dick. On another night, when he runs into the teens alone, he got his revenge, but it was spoiled when he visited Ariana and found out her uncle had been attacked at his shop by gangsters. Dick\\'s tenure as Batman quickly came to an end when Bruce decided to return to the job. That event also brought some long needed healing between Bruce and Dick, who were very much like father and son. Bruce redesigned his costume, making it darker than ever. Robin then had a run in with the KGBeast, but unlike their last encounter, he did not have backup. KGBeast was perfectly willing to kill him and destroy most of Gotham City. Beast had already put down Harvey Bullock, who only survived because Robin performed CPR on him. The battle against the Beast was tough—Robin was tempted to use Bullock\\'s sidearm, but refused. He managed to defeat him just in time for Batman to show up. Bullock was comatose for a while but recovered. Robberies were up recently, and Batman discovered that someone was sending very lame clues to the police department from inside Blackgate Prison. Figuring it was the Cluemaster and he would talk to Robin, Batman took Tim to the prison. Cluemaster told them that he was being blackmailed to plan some crimes by some thugs on the outside—and that they had kidnapped Stephanie. Batman tracked down their lair and Robin got there. Robin saved her life, and after changing into her costume, she insisted on coming along. Batman was not amused, but Stephanie told him that Cluemaster had conned them and was in on the whole thing. While Batman went for another chat with Cluemaster, Robin and Spoiler stayed put until he tipped them in the right direction, where they rounded up the rest of the gang. Spoiler acted like the whole thing was a date, despite Tim\\'s protestations that it was serious business (and that he had a girlfriend already). Afterward, Stephaine paid a \"visit\" to her dad in jail, beating him savagely for what he did to her. King Snake turned up in Gotham again, extending his empire there, but after a brief encounter with his enforcers alongside Huntress, Robin was told to back off by Batman. Robin next saved the life of Mayor Kroll from a disgruntled city employee, but the credit went to another man, this one who had recently been fired for trying to blow the whistle on safety violations around the city. Following a couple of bizarre heists, like a missing lion, Robin stumbled across Ulysses Armstrong , recently released from juvenile hall. Ulysses had recruited a vagrant who was under the impression he was Julius Caesar (having apparently been influenced by an equally vagrant Maxie Zeus ) and together they plotted a crime spree. With some help from Shotgun Smith, Robin foiled the plot. Returning home, he discovered Ariana was in his bedroom. She told him she had run away because her uncle was planning on moving away from the city because of the attack on his shop. Tim might have been in some trouble with his father and the family maid Mrs. Mac for Ariana spending the night (she took his room, he slept in the guest room)--if only Jack\\'s physical trainer hadn\\'t come out of his own bedroom. Dana had worked wonders on Jack in more ways than one, apparently. Jack was up and walking about with a cane, and apparently despite her being considerably younger than Jack, Dana and he had begun a romantic relationship. Robin got to take his mind off things a little by helping Batman investigate a string of local robberies that were perpetrated by a gang of amateur ninjas—one of whom died when he fell off a rooftop. The deceased turned out to be a classmate of Tim\\'s and he learned that the kid had gone to a Ninja Camp. Robin followed another classmate and easily took down some of the ninjas, though they managed to escape. Tim decided to go undercover and enrolled at the camp as his alias, Alvin Draper. He impressed the camp leaders enough that they let him in on their outfit, provided he could pass one last test. Robin passed it with flying colors—and the ninjas were arrested. Tim got home and learned that Ariana\\'s uncle had sold his store and they would be moving at the end of the week. Fortunately, things weren\\'t so bad, thanks to a little help from Bruce Wayne. Bruce arranged for Lucius Fox and Wayne Enterprises to buy the store at a very generous price—enough for the family to open another store in a better neighborhood and remain in the city. Ariana would even be now going to the same school as Tim. That night on patrol, Robin heard that Killer Moth had broken out. Figuring Moth for a third tier super lightweight, Robin went after him. Unfortunately, Moth had just sold his soul to Neron during \"Underworld Unleashed\" and been transformed into Charaxes. The monstrous being shredded its way through some cops and evaded a shootout with Sheriff Smith while capturing Robin—hoping to use him for dinner. Robin was saved by an unknown party before Batman could turn up and Killer Moth was gone. Robin met the new Green Arrow ( Connor Hawke ) about that time. Green Arrow and Spoiler joined Robin to take down some gun runners who were selling guns around Tim\\'s high school. One of Tim\\'s classmates, Karl Ranck, had even been given a gun by his dad to protect himself, prompting Tim to tell his father. Jack had a talk with Karl\\'s dad, who took the gun away. Karl then took one of his dad\\'s and was killed in a shootout at the school. Tim was so angry that he attacked the gunrunners and may have even killed him, had Stephanie and Connor not been there. Tim spotted Stephanie at Karl\\'s funeral and tried to avoid her, prompting Ariana to misread the situation. Then he and Spoiler went after the guy who shot Karl, who was part of a larger street gang. They had to be saved by Batman, who was not happy Robin decided to go at the gang without more backup than Spoiler. He also reminded Tim that Karl had made the choice to pick up the gun and become a target. When the Contagion virus struck Gotham City, Robin was scrambling with everyone else to find a cure, which put him up against Catwoman briefly. Tim was also a victim of the virus, but thankfully Azrael and his allies managed to find a cure and Tim was healed. (see the Contagion entry for more information). Returning home after being cured, Tim found Ariana had dyed her hair blond in an attempt to better keep his attention (thinking that at the funeral, Tim\\'s attention towards Stephanie had been because of her hair color). Wanting to have \"more fun\", Ari agreed to go on a date with another boy, who then attempted to rape her. She managed to escape before anything could happen. Later, Tim admitted he hated the hair color on her, and was pleased to see she had gone back to black hair, although he did not realize the cause of the change back. On a rainy night, he ran across Maxie Zeus , the last of the Arkham escapees still free. Maxie was quite deranged at this point, and he and his hired goon (whom he called Heracles) captured Robin and dragged him along on their heist, which was Maxie\\'s version of the Trojan horse (only involving an armored car). Robin tricked Zeus into letting him call the Oracle, but he managed to free himself and defeat Zeus and his gang without any help (although Oracle sending the police did help). At a car show, Tim spotted Ted Grant, aka Wildcat, and was thrilled to be looking at part of the legend—when Bruce was in training, he anonymously hired Wildcat to teach him to box. Tim also saw that several members of the Speedboyz were back and up to their old tricks. Working with Wildcat, Robin stopped the thieves from stealing a new Waynetech prototype car. Going to the Batcave, Robin learned some bad news—former Mayor Kroll, a victim the Apocalypse virus who was thought to have been cured, had a relapse and died. Tim, along with Nightwing, traveled overseas to chase Ra\\'s al Ghul and ensure that the plague will not come back full force. Soon after, Robin met Impulse for the first time, while on a case in Virginia. While Tim (along with Alfred) was tracking down a group called White Heat and Mystral, Bart Allen\\'s school was at the same mountain lodge on a school ski trip. Tim met Bart early in the trip, and once he saw him in uniform he was able to instantly guess who he was (due to Bart\\'s large feet and wild brown hair) much to Bart\\'s surprise. This would mark the beginning of a long and close friendship. Tim hated that he kept having to mislead Ariana—trouble seemed to come up everywhere, even at a student outing to \"Macbeth on the Beach\" where Tim had to avoid Helena Bernatelli from recognizing him. What\\'s more, Tim also had to deal with the continued attention of Spoiler who kept making passes at him while as Robin. During the Final Night, the two of them were trapped in a snowdrift along with a thug who tried to kill them with a chainsaw. Spoiler could not understand why Robin tried to save the thug trapped in the snow. While they were digging him out, however, they found a woman and her child trapped in the snow and rescued her. Stephanie realized that if they hadn\\'t searched for the crook, they would have never found the mother and child. \"General\" Ulysses Armstrong got out on parole and Robin decided to drop him a visit at home, reminding him that he should stay in line. He knew that Armstrong would not do so, however, and sure enough the kid soon joined up with the Toyman (Winslow Schott) to try and steal the toy collection of a local eccentric, Phillip Crouch. Robin tracked them to Crouch\\'s manor, where a fight broke out with some hi-tech, deadly toys. Toyman betrayed Armstrong, however, and Robin had to rescue him and stop them both. Both were arrested. As a young child, Bruce Wayne enjoyed watching Roy Raymond, a TV criminologist. His son, Roy Raymond Jr. , had a TV show where he called himself Manstalker, a show of dramatizations of real crimes. Tim thought the show was a joke, but it couldn\\'t take his mind off things—Ariana had been a little distant lately, and his friend Ives was keeping secrets too. On patrol, Robin found Slyfox and his crew trying to rob an insurance company, and Manstalker and his TV crew arrived on scene during a special episode. Robin had to destroy the tape in the camera before heading after the hoods, which he apprehended. While Spoiler was out getting into some trouble with Lynx and her goons, Tim was over at Ariana\\'s to spend some time with her. He got the shock of a lifetime while they were alone at her house and she walked out of her room in a sexy nightgown, wanting to sleep with him. Tim finally learned about the guy who had tried to rape her. Although it never got very far, but it left her feeling very scared and vulnerable. Tim told her that he loved her and said it would be best if they waited, since they were so young. Unfortunately, while Tim and Ariana were sharing a tender moment, her uncle and aunt walked in and saw them. Her uncle was not in the mood to listen for an explanation. Tim had to book it before Vari strangled him. He decided to go on patrol, where he ran into Spoiler and she explained about Lynx\\'s Ghost Dragons. Robin agreed to work with her, but the Dragons proved too much for them to handle and they had to back off. Robin knew he should tell her to give up being Spoiler, but he just couldn\\'t do it. Soon, Tim learned that the only secret Ives was keeping was that he had a job dressing as a giant mouse at a family restaurant. Ariana, however, was transferred to an all girl\\'s school. Tim kept thinking about Spoiler, and when he went to meet her, he found out she had been kidnapped by Czonk, who was back to calling himself the Baffler. Despite being one of the dumbest goons in Gotham, the Baffler managed to tie up Robin and Spoiler and planned on leaving them to die in an old project building that was being demolished. He knocked himself out, however, and so they ended up having to save him as well as themselves. Afterward, Robin told Stephanie she might have to stop being Spoiler. When he got home (early the next day) he found his dad back from his recent lecture tour—and Jack had spoken to Ariana\\'s uncle. Tim was grounded, but even when forbidden from leaving his room he still managed to solve a crime via watching the news. Second Sabbatical During the Genesis crisis, Robin was unable to save a hood who tried to kill him from drowning. Feeling depressed, Robin nevertheless had to head for the front-lines—this time literally. Armstrong was back, this time as the adviser to Ali Ben Khadir, a claimant to the throne of the Karoccan Emirate. His rival was being backed by Qurac. With Nightwing\\'s help and a Waynetech jet, Robin went over to the war-torn country (the conflict was escalating with the appearance of more mercenaries on either side, such as Deadline (whom Robin managed to easily take down). Nightwing managed to stop two armies from clashing outside the capital while Robin penetrated Armstrong\\'s lair. He found that Armstrong and his employer had had a falling out, so the boy was arrested and Robin withdrew. Robin had Nightwing drop him off in France, saying that lately he\\'d been feeling lost and decided he needed to step back for a while. He thought Paris was the right place to start, since his training had never really ended there. Knowing that Rahul Llama was dead, Tim decided to train in the course of the Iron Master, although he remained in his identity as Robin. He stopped a former student from stealing from the master and also met a girl named Dava Sborscs. The girl was there to learn a single move to add to her arsenal of lethal moves. She wanted to be able to fight in the war that was destroying her native country of Transbelvia. After she left, Lady Shiva arrived looking for her. Robin had to withdraw, leaving the Iron Master to fight her alone, and she killed him. King Snake was also involved again, this time selling weapons to Transbelvia. Robin went after Dava to warn her about Shiva. Back in Gotham, Jack Drake, Ariana, and Spoiler were all wondering what had happened to Tim. Robin found Dava, a rebel fighting against the oppressive regime, and she has a secret—a special chemical called Aramilla that allows her to move at super-speed. Together, they easily took down some military thugs—but then Shiva turned up. Not willing to step aside and let her murder Dava, Robin attacked. Not even Shiva could stand up to Robin moving at super-speed. Losing control, Robin beat her to death—just in time for King Snake to saunter in. While Dava fought King Snake and his minions, Robin performed CPR and managed to revive Shiva—unfortunately, she had absorbed some of the Aramilla, and at super-speed she took down all of King Snake\\'s men and went after him herself. Robin left them to fight each other and brought an injured Dava to safety. But the war continued, and Robin decided it was finally time to return home. Unfortunately, on the flight home, Gotham City was struck by the Cataclysm, a massive earthquake that leveled most of the city. No Man\\'s Land Robin joined with Batman and the rest of the \"family,\" overwhelmed at the near total destruction of the entire city. There was little that Robin could do in such chaos, and Batman had him stay out of most of the city. Luckily, the Drake home, in one of the outer neighboring communities, suffered only minor damages and they were able to repair it. During the Aftershock, Ariana and Stephanie were both staying in a shelter with their families. Stephanie asked Robin to retrieve her costume, worried someone would steal it and learn her secret. Cluemaster was waiting there, but Robin took him down and turned him in to the National Guard. Unable to be with Ariana for a long period of time, Robin began spending more and more time with Spoiler, causing Robin to realize that he did care for her. However, before taking their new relationship too far, Tim decided that he to break things off with Ariana rather than keep leading her on (the pair had been allowed to date again shortly before). Fortunately, Ariana felt exactly the same way about a breakup, although stating it was because they were too young to be so serious. Tim would later run into Ariana during an awkward meeting upon Tim\\'s later return from Keystone City. At this same time, Robin also became one of the charter members of Young Justice alongside Superboy and Impulse. Despite Superboy\\'s protests, Robin immediately became the team\\'s unofficial leader, due primarily because of his training from Batman. Robin and Spoiler got along well—she didn\\'t pry any about his real identity, and he could share being Robin with her. However, after their first real date, Steph told him that she was pregnant. Robin was not the guilty party (he was not even a suspect)--she was actually about two months along—but he stood by her. Disguised as Alvin Draper, he went to Lamaze classes and told her that she had to give up being Spoiler until after the baby was born. Later, Robin had to save his friends Ives and Hudson from Steeljacket. At school, a friend of Tim\\'s was found dead in the woods and two bullies were suspected of killing him. While Tim initially believed they were innocent, he soon found evidence of their guilt, which lead to their arrest. With all of Gotham in ruins, Jack Drake decided the family should relocate from Gotham Heights for a while. He decided to move to Keystone City along with Dana, who was transferred there. When they arrived, Robin teamed up with the Flash (Wally West) to take on the Riddler and Captain Boomerang. They also got some help from Superman to stop a bomb threat. While they were in Keystone, Stephanie went into labor (earlier than expected) and needed a C-section. Flash got Robin back to Gotham in time for him to come to the hospital and see her before the baby was born just as he promised her. The baby (later revealed to be a girl) was born and Stephanie gave the child up for adoption as planned. Jack was furious with his son for apparently running home to Gotham—but admitted that he had hated Keystone and that he wanted to come back. Robin even managed help Shotgun Smith take down three monstrous thugs who held hostage an emergency room. Now that he had returned, it was time for Robin to help with No Man\\'s Land. Recalled to Gotham City by Batman, Robin and Nightwing had to crawl through an extensive system of tunnels and underground chambers, as the bridges were all down and patrols kept them from going over the river. They had a tussle with Tommy Mangles and Gearhead , but Nightwing easily defeated them and got into the city. Robin was depressed by what he saw—despair and desperation, people fighting to just survive. Batman put Robin to work immediately, ordering him to track down a cache of food from an old shelter. Robin found it—and discovered the Ratcatcher there. Robin had to flee the Ratcatcher and his legions of rats—though a combination of rat bites and exposure to sewage gave him a fever. He managed to stay it off with some antibiotics he brought, and was found by a group of children known as the Wolflings, including a kid Robin knew from his school who was calling himself Aragoth. The Wolflings decided to find the stores, and Robin was too sick to follow them at first. The kids found it, but unfortunately so did the Ratcatcher—and so did Mister Freeze. Robin managed to defeat both Freeze and Ratcatcher, arranging for them to be arrested. Batman was impressed with Robin\\'s actions. Robin did not have much time to recover, however, as he knew Batman and the others were fighting for their lives. Robin was captured by Killer Croc, who was planning an all out battle with Penguin and his police allies. Alfred helped free Robin and he rallied with Bullock and Penguin to defeat Croc. He then had to make the hard decision to call his father and tell him that he was in Gotham—and there was no way out. Jack made a lot of noise, and Washington took notice. Federal agents were ordered to stage a rescue. Tim was told to come to Grant Park to be pulled out. The rescue site turned into a firefight, but Tim was successfully lifted out with some help from the new Batgirl. Brentwood Academy Jack decided to enlist his son in Brentwood Academy, a private high school not too far from home. Because of all his absences, Jack also insisted that Tim board at the school. His first roommate was Ali Ben Khadir, the religious leader of a small country called Dhabar. Ali had a bodyguard, Zugir. Thankfully, Bruce assigned Alfred to be his personal valet for the rest of the semester. Tim decided life at the school wasn\\'t so bad—he still got to see Spoiler and created a new hi-tech skateboard. There were some people who had been transformed into Man-Bat like creatures that warranted investigating. With help from Nightwing, he learned that the bats were Kirk and Francine Langstrom and their child. He had to ask Jason Bard for help. Bard had been entrusted with a serum by Man-Bat years ago. The serum worked on the parents, but the child was born in his condition. Young Justice and the Teen Titans Much like Dick Grayson, Tim Drake has allied himself with the other superheroes in his age demographic. He mostly worked with only the Gotham City heroes, but on occasion joins forces with heroes such as Superman, the Flash, Superboy (who became Tim\\'s best friend) and Impulse . During one adventure where a pre-teen boy was given god-like powers, Robin, Superboy and Impulse joined forces to defeat him. The boys work so well together that they created their own team of heroes called Young Justice . Robin acted as the leader of the team (with Red Tornado acting as team mentor) until the Imperiex War. Due to the team\\'s age, the then President Lex Luthor refused to let teen heroes on the frontline of the war. As such, Young Justice was forced to play the role of a space mobile medical team, collecting injured heroes. During one of their missions, the group crashed onto Apokolips , where they would later be captured and tortured. Robin discovered during those events that over half the team, Superboy, Wonder Girl , Impulse and Cissie King-Jones (formerly Arrowette), no longer trusted him. The cause of the new mistrust came after the Justice League discovered that Batman kept contingency plans on them in case they ever went rogue. As a result, the younger heroes begin to wonder if Robin, who had still not revealed his true identity and kept most of himself hidden, might also have plans to defeat or even kill them. Secret , who has deep feelings for Robin, along with new members Empress and Lil\\' Lobo , however, remained trusting of Robin and side with him. Still, feeling hurt and unable to be a proper leader when only half the team trusted him, as well as strained by assorted other problems in his personal life, Robin quit the team temporarily. Tim rejoined the team after having to go up against Bedlam a second time, during which his secret identity is revealed to his teammates. However, upon his return the team refused to give him back the mantle of leader, and decided instead to elect their leader this time around. Tim lost to Wonder Girl, however the team continued to look at Tim as its tactical expert, aiding Wonder Girl, in leadership, similar to Batman\\'s own position in the JLA. Unwilling to quit Young Justice a second time, Tim takes on the identity of \"Mister Sarcastic\" at a point where Young Justice agree to be become reality TV stars. Soon after, Secret is turned evil by Darkseid and it is Tim (not Robin) who manages to save the world by reminding Greta of her humanity. Soon after Young Justice and the Titans were approached by a company offering to support their super-heroic teams. Before anything could happen however, the team was attacked by a cyborg from the future, who then turned on a robotic Superman in an effort to save itself. The Superman Robot was out of control and while trying to shut it down, Donna Troy and Omen were murdered. Young Justice disbanded soon after, as did the Titans, both of who felt broken following the losses of Donna and Lilith. Cyborg, Starfire and Beast Boy brought Robin, Superboy, Wonder Girl and Impulse (later known as Kid Flash) together to form the new Teen Titans. While Cyborg took the lead, Robin was often seen as the leader of the younger members, even going against the direct orders of the elder Titans. In the \"Titans Tomorrow\" storyline, Tim encountered his future self in the identity of Batman after his mentor died in a crisis. This future happened despite his repeated statement that he did not want to be the next Batman, and is rather content being Robin. In this timeline, Tim was now the leader of the future Titans with himself as Batman. After Bruce Wayne\\'s death, Tim has the Titans take control of the entire West Coast. He orders any rebellions to be put down by Dark Raven absorbing the people\\'s free will and hope. He even hunts down most of Batman\\'s Rogue\\'s gallery and kills them with the handgun that was used to kill Thomas and Martha Wayne. As he explained to his younger self, \"It took me years to do it.\" He even began a relationship with Bettie Kane, who became his partner, Batwoman. He later killed her during an argument; wracked with guilt, he makes a deal with Ra\\'s al Ghul to restore her using the Lazarus Pit. Once revived, however, she joined the Titans East (led by an older version of Cyborg) and opposed him and his team. His latest victim before the younger Teen Titans show up was Duela Dent, the Joker\\'s daughter, whom he apparently murdered out of revenge for the death of assorted people including Cassandra Cain and Alfred Pennyworth. War Games Just before The War Games story arc, Tim\\'s father, Jack Drake, discovered Tim\\'s secret identity. Jack was enraged and threatened to expose the secret identities of all those involved with Batman. Tim offered Jack a deal, in which he would give up his role as Robin to respect his father\\'s wishes; in exchange, Jack would keep their secret identities safe. After this, Stephanie Brown took over the role of Robin for a short period, until Batman fired her for disobeying orders. Soon afterward, a massive gang war (which Stephanie starts unintentionally) consumes Gotham City, and found its way into Tim\\'s school. After assisting the Bat-Team to the best of his abilities, with no equipment or costume, Tim protected his classmates, but not without casualties. Tim then realized that he cannot disregard his responsibilities and took up the Robin mantle again, against his father\\'s wishes. When Jack found out that Tim was Robin again, he grudgingly realized how truly important his son was to Gotham, despite the immense danger. Black Mask then captured and tortured Stephanie. She then seemingly died from both her injuries and the willful negligence of Batman\\'s confidante Leslie Thompkins at the end of the story arc. Identity Crisis and Blüdhaven In Identity Crisis, Tim, along with the rest of the superhero community, tried to keep all of their loved ones safe after some tragic attacks come down upon the family members of the Justice League. One night, while Batman and Robin were investigating these crimes, they received an incoming transmission from Oracle saying that Tim\\'s father needed to speak to him immediately. It turns out that there is an intruder in the Drake home and a mysterious note with a gun was left for Jack suggesting that he protect himself. Jack told Tim that he was proud of him, and that he is not responsible if something bad happened. The intruder turned out to be the hired killer Captain Boomerang. Jack fired as Captain Boomerang unleashed a razor boomerang and the two killed each other before Batman and Robin can make it back to the scene. Like Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, Tim Drake had now lost both of his parents to crime. Dana Drake, meanwhile, suffered from a complete mental breakdown upon discovering her husband\\'s death, and Tim placed her in a mental hospital in Blüdhaven, where he took up residence as the city\\'s protector along with Batgirl. Soon after, however, the city was destroyed during an attack by a group of super-villains, after which Dana disappeared. Whether she was killed or removed from continuity following the Infinite Crisis has not been explained. At around this time, Bruce Wayne offered to adopt Tim. Unwilling to take Bruce up on the offer, Tim hired an actor to arrive, claiming to be Tim\\'s Uncle Eddie. Unfortunately, Batman quickly discovered the ruse and confronted Tim about it. However, Bruce revealed that he is neither disappointed nor angered by Tim\\'s actions, but in truth was greatly impressed and instead offered to help teach Tim how to completely cover all his tracks. Soon afterward, a military super-hero legend called The Veteran (similar to Marvel Comics\\' Captain America) attempted to recruit Robin. Tim, now concerned with his own mission rather than Batman\\'s, took the Veteran\\'s offer under consideration and went on a mission with his team to get a feel for the job. Tim eventually turned down the offer. Robin vs. Robin Some time prior the events of Identity Crisis, Jason Todd returned, seemingly from the dead, as the new Red Hood . Angered that someone had replaced him as Robin, Jason broke into Titans Tower wearing a version of his own Robin costume (only previously seen in the back-pages of volume one-era Teen Titans). Quickly immobilizing the other Titans, Jason confronted Tim to see if the new Boy Wonder was really as good as everyone claims. The two Robins fight, until at last Jason struck Tim down in the Hall of Fallen Titans, where he also raged at how he was forgotten by everyone. Although Drake was defeated, Jason demands to know if he still believed himself to be as good as people say, to which Tim replied with a defiant \"Yes\" before Todd rendered him unconscious. Jason spared Tim\\'s life, simply tearing off the \\'R\\' shaped emblem from his chest. In the epilogue of the story, Jason had developed a grudging sort of respect for Tim, wondering if he would have been a better Robin and a better person, had he lived a life like Tim\\'s and had real friends like the Titans. Infinite Crisis & 52 As of the events surrounding the Infinite Crisis storyline, Robin, along with the Veteran\\'s forces, defended the city of Blüdhaven against an army of OMACs who captured dozens of meta-humans for immediate extermination. After a virus deactivated the cyborgs (see also: The OMAC Project), Tim, the Shadowpact and the Veteran\\'s team accomplished the capture of the meta-humans. With Blüdhaven safe, Wonder Girl arrived on the scene asking Robin for help. Along with the Teen Titans, the Doom Patrol and the Justice Society of America, he battled against Superboy-Prime, who had gone on a violent assault of their world\\'s Superboy. The fight overwhelmed Conner\\'s body to the point where it began eating away at itself for energy. After Robin\\'s departure from Blüdhaven, the city was destroyed by the Society. Although he worried about his stepmother, his \"uncle\", and Nightwing, Tim continued to Titans Tower. He then lead a successful assault into one of Lex Luthor\\'s genetic research bases to find a cure for Superboy. With Blüdhaven still in chaos, Superman left Robin in command of all the superhero rescue efforts. However, when the government put the city on complete lock down, the Titans were kicked out. Following the discovery of Superboy\\'s death in the North Pole, Robin joined the rest of the world\\'s heroes in a final battle against the Secret Society of Super Villains in Metropolis. Although the heroes won the battle, many on both sides are injured and killed. After the Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retraced Bruce Wayne\\'s original journey around the world in his quest to become Batman (see also: 52). At a ceremony honoring Superboy one year after his death, Robin attended in a new costume primarily red and black. When asked why, he explained that they were Conner\\'s colors. One Year Later After spending nearly a year away from home after the events of the Infinite Crisis, Tim was the first to return to Gotham following his trip with Batman and Nightwing. He received a message from an unknown source telling him that if he did not return to the states, Batgirl would be killed. Tim moved into the Wayne Estate, living in the Carriage House, which had been converted into a loft and Robin\\'s new \"nest\". Upon his return to Gotham, Robin went in search of Batgirl, only to be attacked in an alley. Using his \"R\" shaped throwing stars, he supposedly killed his opponent, which he realized was Lynx (who already had died while battling Batgirl) dressed in a Batgirl costume. After doing an in-depth investigation, Tim discovered that the kidnapper is in truth Cassandra Cain, who had become the leader of a splinter cell of the League of Assassins. Cassandra orchestrated her \"kidnapping\" and the release of her father, David Cain, as a plan to convince Robin to join her. Robin refused, and after a lengthy battle, she escaped. Soon after, Batman approached Tim and once again made him the offer of being adopted. After the events of the past years, Tim this time accepted the offer, and became Bruce Wayne\\'s legal son. At the same time, Tim had retaken control of the Teen Titans, which during his absence suffered many upheavals and changes in the roster. At first, the team was comprised solely of himself, Kid Devil and Ravanger. Soon after, he manages to assemble Cyborg, Wonder Girl, Raven, Miss Martian, and a resurrected Jericho into the team\\'s ranks. Unfortunately, soon after the team got reassembled, they were attacked by Deathstroke the Terminator and his own squadron of Titans, he dubbed \"The Titans East\". During their battle with the group, Robin discovered that Batgirl was under the same mind control serum that Deathstroke used on Ravanger. Using a cure he developed, he freed Cassandra from Deathstroke\\'s control. Unfortunately, still driven by a thirst for vengeance, Cassandra did not immediately return to the Gotham with him. She would later rejoin the Batman Family, and in fact be adopted by Batman shortly before his \"death\". During his time with the new Titans, Tim developed an uneasy romantic relationship with Wonder Girl, both of whom were still having difficultly letting go of the loss of Superboy. Despite several kisses, and attempts at a romantic relationship, they continued to back out at the last minute from making anything serious. Soon after, the Titans were shocked to learn that their old friend and teammate Bart Allen had been murdered by the Flash Rogues. The loss of Kid Flash, and his upset personal life, led Robin to become a colder and more detached leader with the Titans. Batman R.I.P. In the months that follow, Robin began to catch glimpses of a familiar purple costume around Gotham City, and began to question whether or not someone had taken up the Spoiler mantel, once worn by his deceased girlfriend Stephanie Brown. He voiced these concerns to Batman who seemed both unsurprised and uninterested, which infuriated Tim. Finally, Robin confronts the new Spoiler, and discovered that it is in fact Stephanie. She reveals to him that Doctor Thompkins faked her death, so as to allow her to escape from the dangerous life of being a vigilante, and that the pair of them left for Africa following the gang war. Batman revealed that he had suspected that truth for a long time that Stephanie was not dead, and this was why he never put her Spoiler or Robin costumes in a trophy case. Soon after, Batman became targeted by a group calling themselves the Black Glove. Their attacks became so intense that they apparently drive Batman insane, and he disappears, leaving Robin alone to defend the city. He enlisted the aid of Spoiler, who unfortunately was ordered by Batman to interfere with his work, in order to help make him a better hero. As such, Spoiler hired assorted villains and assassins in order to force Robin to up his game. Spoiler went so far as to enlist the help of Robin\\'s old foe, Ulysses Armstrong AKA the General. Unfortunately, Ulysses was quick to betray Spoiler, due to his vendetta against Robin. Upon discovering that Spoiler had been orchestrating everything, Robin broke off all ties with her, and ordered her never to again don her costume. Meanwhile, Robin was forced to battle against his adopted older brother Jason Todd, who started a gang war in an attempt to gain control over the gangs. Jason attempted to coax Robin to join him, but Tim refused, due to his disagreeing with Jason\\'s methods. During the fight that followed, Jason was defeated due to the combined efforts of Robin, a gang member shooting Jason in the knee, and the arrival of someone claiming to be a new Red Robin, an identity previously used by Jason Todd. Robin began to investigate the new Red Robin and discovered it to be Ulysses. Although Robin managed to temporarily defeat him, he had later been led into a trap supposedly set by Ulysses\\' partner, Anarky . Robin was nearly killed in a warehouse explosion, but managed to somehow survive, though he suffered from extreme burns to the back of his head. It was later revealed that the real Anarky had been left in a paralytic state thanks to Ulysses, who has usurped the Anarky identity. Upon discovering this, Robin donned the hood and cape of the Red Robin, and went out to confront Ulysses. Although he managed to defeat him, it came at the loss of several civilian casualties. However, in the end, Robin managed to bring an end to the gang war, and created a temporary amount of peace throughout the city. As a result of his actions and the continued absence of Batman, Commissioner Gordon opted to have a Robin Signal made, thus making Robin the city\\'s primary protector. While appreciating the gesture, Robin requested they go back to the Bat-signal so as to make the city believe that Batman was still around. Due to the events that were occurring in Gotham needing his full attention, Robin decided that it was time to step down as leader of the Teen Titans and gave leadership over to Wonder Girl. Around this time, it was revealed that Batman\\'s slip into madness and supposed disappearance was in fact an elaborate plan created by Batman to draw out the Black Glove. Although through the combined efforts of Batman and his allies, and the Black Glove was defeated, Batman was supposedly killed in a helicopter crash battling the group\\'s leader. It was Robin who informed Commissioner Gordon of the true events. In truth, however, Batman survived the crash, and later joined the Justice League during the events of the Final Crisis. Unfortunately, Batman was seemingly killed during his final confrontation with the new god, Darkseid, thus leaving Dick, Cassandra, Jason, and Tim once again orphaned. Following the loss of Batman, Tim was forced to face a ghost from his past, the Obeah Man, who had managed to bribe his way out of prison. Refusing to let the man who killed his mother escape true justice, Tim followed him to Haiti, where the Obeah Man attempted to drive Tim insane with gases and special effects. Tim, however, made short work of the Obeah Man and sent him back to jail, using Wayne Enterprise\\'s lawyers, thus giving Tim final closure on his mother\\'s death. Battle for the Cowl In the months that followed, the Bat-Family was trying desperately to bring order to Gotham. Dick led the effort but refused to become Batman despite Tim\\'s urging. Meanwhile, a man impersonating Batman began his war on crime using lethal tactics and leaving slips of paper saying \"I AM BATMAN\". Tim found that the impostor was none other than Jason, and he began a search to stop him, even dressing up as Batman himself in order to demonstrate how the real Batman would have acted. Tim found Jason\\'s Batcave in a subway station, and was saved from a booby trap by Catwoman, who knew Tim was behind the mask. Jason ambushed them, disposing of Catwoman, and then getting into a fight with Tim before impaling him in the chest with a batarang, exclaiming, \"One more to go.\" Thankfully, the kevlar re-enforcement of the Bat-suit that Tim used protected him from being killed, although it did leave him extensively injured. Still, Tim managed to have enough strength to attempt an escape, but a combination of injury and blood-loss found himself too weak to get far. Jason caused his base to explode by dueling Nightwing, and the base began to cave in on itself. Luckily, Damian , along with the Squire, managed to rescue Tim before he could fall to his death. Red Robin Soon after, Dick at last agreed to take on the mantel of the Batman. Unfortunately, much to Tim\\'s shock, Dick did not ask him to continue as Robin. Stating that Tim was more his equal and ally than protege, Dick instead offered the mantle of Robin to Damian. Feeling betrayed and infuriated, Tim left. Whether due to his refusal to let go of another father or something else, Tim came to the belief that Bruce was still alive somewhere in the world. As such, he left Gotham behind in order to begin his search. But as he was no longer the Boy Wonder, he took on a mantle previously worn by Jason: the Red Robin. Tim began traveling around the world looking for Bruce Wayne. Tim cut himself off from the rest of the Bat-Family, who all believed he was having problems due to the shock of losing his mentor. Tim, however, managed to get proof of Bruce Wayne\\'s continued existence, and also managed to cripple Ra\\'s al Ghul\\'s organization. In response, Ra\\'s promised an attack to destroy everything the Wayne Family had built in Gotham. While travelling around the world, Tim was called back to Gotham to help Dick Grayson and Damian Wayne who - in their roles as Batman and Robin - were fending off an army of zombie-like Black Lanterns in Gotham after millions of dead heroes and villains came back to life due to a Black Lantern ring, similar to the Green Lanterns\\' rings. Tim was able to hold his own as Red Robin, and after saving Tammy Fox, the two rushed back to Gotham. One of the first actions Tim took upon arriving in Gotham was defeating Killer Moth . After capturing Moth, Tim began to contemplate ways in which to find and save Batman from the past, but not before turning his attention back towards Ra\\'s plans against Wayne\\'s family. Tim headed to the Batcave hoping to find Dick, but instead finds Stephanie Brown , who was now the new Batgirl . Reluctant at first, the two joined forces and managed to rescue Leslie Thompkins from assassins, and were later joined by Tim\\'s ally from the League of Assassins, Pru. New 52 Tim Drake, Batman\\'s former sidekick, is back in action when an international organization seeks to capture, kill or corrupt super-powered teenagers. As Red Robin, he\\'s going to have to team up with the mysterious and belligerent powerhouse thief known as Wonder Girl and the hyperactive speedster calling himself Kid Flash to stand any chance at all against a living, breathing weapon with roots in another world. He is quickly developing feelings for the Metahuman Powerhouse Cassandra \"Wonder Girl\" Sandsmark. DC Rebirth After his time as Red Robin, Tim started to operate under the mantle of “Drake.” However, in the absence of Damian Wayne, he shed this name and once again began operating as Robin. After again breaking up with Stephanie Brown, Tim goes on a journey of self-discovery and realizes he is bisexual and starts dating old friend Bernard Dowd This section is a stub .

Powers and Abilities Martial Arts Master: Tim has been trained by Batman, Nightwing, Batgirl, Lady Shiva and assorted others in a wide assortment of martial arts disciplines which include but are not limited to Kung Fu, Aikido, Jeet Kune Do, Escrima, Krav Maga, Tae Kwon Do, Judo, Wing Chun, Hapkido, Karate, Savate, Kendo, Ninjitsu, Tai Chi, Leopard Kung Fu and Biangan. His abilities with the bo-staff gives him an extra edge with his fighting. He has also been considered the most skilled hero in all the DC Universe with his preferred weapon of choice though there is a another combatant who is truly the most skilled with their weapon of choice in all the DC Universe . Although he has not mastered near as many fighting styles as his mentors, he has managed to use the training given to be considered a highly skilled combatant. Escapologist: Batman and Nightwing have trained Red Robin to be skilled in escaping from any trap, lock or captivity, ranging from the most simplistic of handcuffs to the most elaborate of cages. Gifted Intellect: His naturally high intellect allows him to excel in computer science and more importantly as a skilled detective. Further more, Tim apparently has a firm grasp of assorted scientific techniques including biology, engineering and genetics, which he has been shown to use in his attempts at re-cloning Superboy. Batman states that Tim could potentially be smarter and better than himself. The Batman has trained him in many disciplines, such as forensic, criminology, acrobatics, stealth, disguise, and escapology. Master Detective: His ability to deduce the secret identities of superheroes on his own has been used to underscore his skill. Among the identities used in this way are the Batman, both of his predecessors as Robin, the Huntress, Impulse, the Flash, and Captain Marvel. Master Tactician and Strategist: Tim, much like Dick Grayson is also a brilliant and experienced strategist with impressive leadership skills, having served as leader to the Teen Titans, Young Justice, and even being placed in charge of the rescue efforts of Blüdhaven by Superman, following the attack made by Deathstroke and his fellow villains. In recent times, he has managed to orchestrate the unified control of the Gotham Street Gangs, thus reducing the threats they pose to the city. Paraphernalia Robin Costume 1: Drake\\'s original costume was slightly different from that of his predecessors as supplied by Batman to give him a measure of increased protection. It includes an armored tunic, a cape that is black on the outside though still yellow on the inside, and green leggings. Other details include an armored gorget, jika-tabi style boots, an emergency \"R\" shuriken on his chest in addition to the traditional batarangs, a utility belt that is less bulky, and a collapsible bo staff as primary weapon. There is also a general change of the theme of the equipment from \"Bat\" to \"Robin\" Robin Costume 2: Tim updated his costume to match Superboy\\'s black and red color scheme as homage to his late friend. These updates include long sleeves, the elimination of the green from the suit, the addition of scallops to his gloves and cape, and inclusion of a utility belt with pockets. The scallops on the cape give an illusion of feathers rather than bat-wings, as seen on the cape of the Batman. The stylized \"R\" on Robin\\'s chest has been replaced with a more traditional one, though its appearance varies from artist to artist. Robin retains his \"R\" shurikens, but he now carries them in his belt as opposed to his tunic. During a brief period where he suffered damaging burns, Tim temporarily wore the Red Robin hood and cape, which covered his head and offered him glider capabilities. Batman Costume: With Batman supposedly dead and Dick Grayson refusing to become Batman, Tim temporarily assumes the mantle, by wearing Bruce\\'s old blue and grey costume, with the yellow background emblem surrounding the Bat on his chest. He continues to carry his bo-staff. Red Robin Costume: With Damian now assuming the role as the fifth Robin, Tim adopted the full uniform of Red Robin. This costume seems to contain a mixture of both Tim\\'s old Robin uniforms, as well as Batman\\'s. The uniform is comprised of black leggings and boots, a red tunic similar to that of Dick Grayson\\'s old Robin tunic, though lacking the \\'R\\' emblem. He wears a utility belt, again similar to the one worn by Dick Grayson while as Robin, only of a slightly larger size. He then has a chest harness, that is connected by the Red Robin symbol. Finally, he wears a black cowl and cape. Rather than using throwing stars or batarangs like before, Tim now uses Red Robin throwing disks. He does, however, continue to use his collapsible bo-staff as his primary weapon. Red Robin Costume 2: With a few minor alterations by Alfred, Tim begins patrolling with a new version of the Red Robin costume. The hip-flaps are replaced with a more streamlined look and the heavy leather is replaced (or at least lessened). Tim returns to a utility belt more like his previous Robin costume (arguably more Batman in nature, as well, ditching the thin rod-canisters in favour of the metal, square \"pouch\"-style). It seems, if the cover of Red Robin 13 is anything to go off of, that Tim has developed a sort of Red Robin-branded batarang of his own to replace the throwing disks. Transportation : Tim first vehicle was the Redbird car. It is capable of morphing between a highly armored combat vehicle and a normal looking car. With the disappearance of Batman, Robin has also begun using the Batmobile. Robin Weapons: \"R\" shurikens, Batarangs, extendible staff given to him by Lady Shiva. He also often uses a sling. Red Robin Weapons: Red Robin emblem throwing disks, collapsible bo-staff, grappling hooks.', 'Robin General Information Real name: Richard John Grayson Aliases: Dick Grayson Robin Alignment: Good Affiliation: John Grayson (Deceased Father) Mary Grayson (Deceased Mother) Mitch Grayson (Deceased older Brother) Bruce Wayne / Batman (Friend, mentor and partner) Alfred Pennyworth (Friend) Barbara Wilson/Batgirl (Partner and love interest) Portrayed by: Chris O\\'Donnell Appearances: Batman Forever Batman & Robin Robin is the alias of Batman\\'s crime-fighting partner, Dick Grayson . Contents 1 Biography 1.1 Batman Forever 1.2 Batman & Robin 2 Equipment 2.1 Vehicles 3 Appearances 4 Behind the Scenes 4.1 Trivia Biography Batman Forever Dick was the youngest son of John and Mary . They were a team of acrobats who were called The Flying Graysons who worked in a circus along with his elder brother, Mitch . They went all across the world with the rest of the circus with their astounding acts. While they were on tour in Gotham City , the Flying Graysons\\' show was interrupted by a psychopathic villain who was named Two-Face who, along with his Thugs , held the audience and entertainers hostage with an orb that hung from the top of the tent that was filled with two hundred sticks of TNT, and was controlled with a radio detonator that was set to go off in two minutes, but would disarm in exchange for Batman \\'s life. Bruce Wayne, who was in attendance at the circus with Dr. Chase Meridian , tried to sacrifice himself, but due to the screaming of the terrified audience, Two-Face was unable to hear him. The Graysons selflessly decided to help everyone by destroying the explosive device themselves. While Dick successfully disposed of the orb, Two-Face flipped his coin to decide the fate of Dick\\'s family; and the coin landed on the scarred side. As a result, Two-Face shot apart one of the harnesses that kept the rest of Dick\\'s family hanging, and caused them to fall down to the hard ground below, and they all died on impact. Dick returned and was greatly heartbroken to see the corpses of his whole family. He never slept, spoke to anyone, or even ate because of that terrible tragedy and gained a great hatred for Two-Face. Sometime later, Commissioner James Gordon took Dick to Wayne Manor where Bruce, who felt partly to blame for the murder of Dick\\'s family, took him in, though Dick did not want to stay (for long, at least). Dick quickly struck up a friendship with Alfred Pennyworth . When Alfred brought up the image of a robin on Dick\\'s motorcycle helmet, he told Alfred that he once saved his brother\\'s life during circus practice after Mitchell\\'s wire broke by swinging out and grabbing him (\" I flew in like a robin. \"), and earned tremendous respect from his father who praised him as a hero. After he saw great potential in Dick as a crime fighter, Alfred assured Dick that \" broken wings mend in time \" and promised that \" one day Robin will fly again \". After he accidently discovered the Batcave , Dick decided to go for a joyride in the Batmobile . He saved a teenage girl from a street gang , who had him outnumbered until Batman arrived. Dick was initially furious upon learning that Bruce was Batman and blamed him for his family\\'s deaths. Later, Dick demanded that Bruce help him find Two-Face so that he could kill him. Bruce refused, and did not want Dick to end up like him; a loner. But Dick insisted on being involved. When Batman was almost killed by Two-Face after the latter and his thugs crashed the NygmaTech business party, Dick (dressed in his circus outfit and wearing a mask) intervened and saved his life. Bruce, however, was angry with him for putting his own life at risk, and rejected his offer to join him as his partner in crime-fighting. When Bruce decided to give up being Batman in order to pursue a normal life with his girlfriend, Chase Meridian, Dick ran away before Chase was kidnapped by both Two-Face and the Riddler , and took his circus costume with him. When Batman was on his way to rescue Chase and stop the two villains, Dick returned, wore a crime fighter\\'s suit that was designed by Alfred, and became Batman\\'s new partner, \"Robin\", in order to save her. Upon arriving at the Riddler\\'s fortress, Claw Island , Batman and Robin were separated and were forced to split up. Robin found Two-Face, viciously thrashed him in a vengeful rage, and sent him hanging over the edge of a cliff. Unable to take a life after he was bluffed by Two-Face, Robin pulled him back up with the intention of sending him to jail. Two-Face responded by taking him at gunpoint to the Riddler. He was tied up, gagged with duct tape, and placed in a giant glass cylinder with Chase, in another cylinder, on the other side of the room. Batman arrived and the Riddler gave him a choice to save Chase or Robin. Batman destroyed the Riddler\\'s mind device, which warped the Riddler\\'s mind in the process. Before he collapsed, the Riddler made the lids of the two cylinders that held Robin and Chase open, and sent them down to the rocks and water below. Batman, however, saved them both, but Two-Face appeared, took aim at the three of them, and was about to shoot them. However, Batman reminded Two-Face about his coin and that he\\'s always had two minds about everything. When Two-Face concurred with that and flipped his coin to decide their fate, Batman threw a handful of coins that were identical to his and Two-Face frantically tried to get all of them when he suddenly lost his balance and plummeted down to the spiky pit below, with his actual coin landing in the palm of his hand on the good side as he sank into the pit, dead. Robin stared at Two-Face as he fell to his death, and was satisfied that his family was avenged. In the years that followed, Robin continued to serve as Batman\\'s sidekick. Batman & Robin Robin became a little more independent and used rash methods which caused Batman not to trust him. He almost got himself killed by Mr. Freeze and turned by Poison Ivy , which left Batman frustrated. Dick became romantically entangled with Alfred\\'s niece, Barbara Wilson , who later joined the crime fighting team under the alias Batgirl, but spends most of the film being hopelessly in love with Poison Ivy. Dick was deeply sorrowful when he learned that Alfred was dying from a rare disease that was called MacGregor\\'s Syndrome . Robin\\'s relationship with Poison Ivy began when he and Batman first met her at a Charity Ball. Ivy made her grand entrance and began flirting with the two heroes and getting them with her pheromone dust. The two got into a bidding war for Poison Ivy, only being stopped when Mr. Freeze crashed the party. Freeze stole the Eye of Isisa, a necklace donated for charity, but before Robin followed Batman after him, he stared awestruck at Ivy, who noticed and blew a kiss at him. Dick got into an argument with Bruce, after capturing Mr. Freeze. He accused him of not trusting in what he does, and wanting Poison Ivy for himself. Dick ignored Bruce\\'s reply that he must follow his rules or he won\\'t be a part of the team, and stormed off in anger. Later, Robin and Batman learned that Ivy has helped Freeze escape Arkham and investigated his hideout. There, they were confronted by Ivy and her enforcer Bane. Poison Ivy ambushed Robin, and he tried to place her under arrest, but Ivy was unintimidated by The Boy Wonder. She once again blew her pheromone dust at the Boy Wonder and offered him a kiss, but they were interrupted when Bane tossed Batman down at them. Robin went off to confront Bane, leaving the Dark Knight with Ivy, but was easily overpowered and defeated by the brute. Poison Ivy failed to seduce Batman, but had more success with the inexperienced Robin. While Batman struggled with Bane, Ivy cornered and flirted with the Boy Wonder, convincing him he didn\\'t need the Dark Knight and could be his own man. She wrapped the hero in a hug, telling him she could see his own \"Robin-Signal\" in the sky, and she could guide him. Now completely in love, Robin offered no resistance against Ivy and the two slowly leaned in for a kiss but were once again interrupted by Batman, who had defeated Bane. Batman correctly guessed that Ivy had been trying to kiss them to poison them, remembering one victim at a airport. Robin however, blinded by love, thought Batman was jealous and that Poison Ivy loved him instead, so attacked Batman to defend her. He was easily overpowered by the Dark Knight though and thrown in a vat of ice cream, while Ivy made her escape when the duo was distracted. Batman pulled out his partner, but Robin declared their partnership over and that from now on he\\'s going solo. Poison Ivy later stole the Batsignal , and replaced it with a bird symbol, turning it into a \"Robin-Signal\". Robin saw this and remembered what Ivy told him. He knew it was from Ivy, calling him to her as a sign of love. Robin prepared to leave to meet Ivy, but Bruce stopped him. Dick still thought he was jealous that Ivy was calling for Robin as her true love, instead of Batman. Bruce begged him one more time to trust him about her and to listen, and claimed he was looking out for him as a family does. The Boy Wonder later arrived at Poison Ivy\\'s lair, the Turkish Bath House , and slowly made his way inside. As he went further in, the path behind him became blocked by vines. He reached the center of the lair, which contained a lily pond and a giant floral plant at the end which opened up to reveal Poison Ivy, looking more seductively beautiful than ever wearing a new red dress, a new hair style and using the plant as her throne. Robin was stunned by her reveal and beauty, and momentarily surprised when the entrance became blocked one last time, before turning around to face Ivy. She greeted Robin and he slowly made his way across the pond by walking on the lily pads, sitting next to Ivy. Robin said he loved Ivy and wanted them to be together, but asked for a sign of trust from her that she was really \" turning over a new leaf \". He ignored Ivy\\'s flirts, and specifically asked for her to tell him her plan. She put a hand on his back and leaned forward, saying she\\'ll tell him in exchange for a kiss first, but Robin flipped the offer, promising to kiss her if she tells him first. Ivy revealed Freeze\\'s plan to freeze Gotham to Robin, and he quickly turned to leave to stop him. Ivy grabbed Robin and pulled him back to face her, speaking gently to him: \" One kiss, my love... for luck \". Ivy gave a seductive smile and Robin silently submitted to her at last. Ivy gently placed a hand on the Boy Wonder\\'s face and they both leaned forward, closing their eyes, with Robin missing the evil smirk Ivy had on her face. The two shared a romantic, passionate kiss at last, until Ivy broke the kiss. Ivy rubbed noses with the Boy Wonder and revealed her true nature to him in mock \"sadness\" while stroking his chin, telling him it\\'s time to die. The Boy Wonder, however, revealed a surprise of his own: he was wearing rubber lips to protect himself from her poisonous kiss. Robin had played Ivy since he arrived, he pretended to still be blindingly in love with her to learn where her true allegiance was, the same way she pretended to love him. He tricked her into telling him her plan and once her guard was down had used their kiss as a test to see if her love to him was real, a test Ivy had just failed. Ivy stared in shock at the rubber lip that ruined everything, then at The Boy Wonder she thought she had wrapped around her finger. She couldn\\'t believe that Robin had tricked her and stole a kiss from her, and her shocked stare turns into an angry glare. She furiously leaped forward and shoved Robin off her throne and into the vine infested pond to drown him. Robin was quickly submerged by the vines and struggled to stay above water for air. As he struggled, Ivy walked away from her throne, stopping only to wave bye to Robin and mockingly taunted him by saying \" see ya! \" just to rub in that she was \" breaking up with him \", officially ending their relationship. However, Robin managed to cut himself free of the vines and Poison Ivy was quickly defeated by Batgirl, knocked back onto the throne they had just been sharing and she had shoved him from. The throne closed on Ivy after she was knocked onto it, trapping her in the symbol of her and Robin\\'s false love. Batman and Robin left to stop Freeze with Batgirl, and the Boy Wonder left Poison Ivy and his feelings for her behind in her lair. In the end, Robin stayed on Batman\\'s team, and together, they defeated Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, and Bane , and also obtained the cure for Alfred\\'s condition from Freeze in the process, who offered it to them out of gratitude for revealing to him that it was Ivy, not Batman, who tried to kill his wife , and that they had found and restored her. Bruce and Dick\\'s trust in one another was finally restored, their bond grew stronger, and they became family. With Barbara as a member of the team, the Terrific Trio continued to protect Gotham from crime.

Prior to Batman Forever , the character was planned to be featured in both Batman and Batman Returns , going as far as casting actors in the role. However, Robin was frequently cut for various reasons, primarily assumed because of Tim Burton \\'s dislike for the character. After the announcement of comic series Batman \\'89 and it featuring its own version of Robin , many consider this version a different incarnation of the character. Due to the schedule and child labor laws, it was elected very early in production to cast an actor over the age of 18 to avoid limited shooting hours. While the final film would receive a great amount of criticism for this decision, early screenplays better explained this change to the characters age and his reasoning for living with Bruce Wayne after his family’s murder. Trivia Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg were considered for the role of Robin for Batman Forever . Robin\\'s costume in Batman & Robin bares many similarities to his comic counterpart\\'s then-contemporary Nightwing outfit, though with the addition of a cape. The \"Nightwing\" identity is also mentioned briefly in Batman Forever as a potential \" sidekick name \".', 'Nightwing General Information Real name: Richard John Grayson Aliases: Dick Grayson Robin The Boy Wonder Nightwing Portrayed by: Loren Lester Appearances: See: Appearances Dick Grayson is an ally of Batman and was the first Robin , helping the Dark Knight defend Gotham City from crime.

Dick and his parents performed nightly with their death defying high wire acts. When the circus came to Gotham City , the gangster, Tony Zucco tried to extort protection money out of the owner, but he refused to cooperate. In retaliation, Zucco sabotaged their high-wire trapeze act, staging an \"accident\" that ended in the death of Dick\\'s parents. Bruce Wayne, who helped to get the circus to town, was in the audience and witnessed these events unfold. Wayne arranged with Commissioner Gordon of the Police Department to become the 10-year-old\\' boy\\'s legal guardian. However, in the rather large and empty Wayne Manor , Dick became more and more detached. Alfred Pennyworth brought this to Wayne\\'s attention, who was in his fledgling years as Batman, and had little time to spend with Dick. Eventually, Dick went out on his own and tracked down Zucco but was caught. Batman saved Dick and took him back to the Batcave, where he revealed his secret to Dick. Robin After personally training Grayson, Wayne allowed him to become his partner, Robin. Dick, apparently worked with Batman consistently well into his college years. Thereafter, he became Batman\\'s semi-regular partner continuing to work with Batman on a limited basis but, also dividing his time between crimefighting and college. Nine years after his parent\\'s deaths, Tony Zucco resurfaced in Gotham City, putting Robin to the test. Batman forbade Robin from going after him. Robin promptly disobeyed and tracked Zucco on his own. He finally found Zucco, but, Robin ultimately refused to kill Zucco and turned him over to the authorities. While Dick had thought that Bruce was simply cold hearted; Bruce got surprisingly emotional and he admitted that he didn\\'t want Robin going after Zucco for fear of Robin being hurt or killed as a result. However, this would not be the last time Batman and Robin disagreed with each other. After graduating Gotham State University with highest honors, Grayson decided it was time for a change. A trust fund set up by the circus would keep him afloat indefinitely. Grayson also didn\\'t like the way Batman was interrogating a henchman of the Joker mercilessly in front of his own family and left outraged. The final straw was Grayson discovering that Wayne knew Barbara Gordon , his girlfriend, was Batgirl, and never told him. Grayson relinquished the mantle of Robin and left Gotham to travel the world and find himself. Nightwing After graduating from college, Dick had a falling out with Batman over the tactics he used. He consequently left Gotham City and traveled the globe from studying various martial arts and crimefighting techniques. Around this time, he also gained access to a sizable insurance settlement which allowed him to be self-sufficient. After a few years of world travelling and training, he returned to Gotham City. He rejoined Batman\\'s campaign as Nightwing, but his relationships with Batman and Batgirl became somewhat strained. In spite of this, he continued to work semi-regularly with Batman\\'s crime fighting team. He worked with Batman to trick Catwoman into revealing the location of a stolen gem. He also helped get to the bottom of the Joker\\'s fortune. As Nightwing, Grayson has established himself an equal to Batman. However, Grayson eventually left Gotham to establish himself in the city of Blüdhaven . Nightwing was active into late age protecting his new city. Batman Beyond Dick Grayson is only mentioned in the show. For details of the comic book counterpart of the character, see Dick Grayson (Beyondverse) . Powers and abilities Raised as a circus acrobat, Dick was capable of incredible feats of agility and gymnastic skills. Later, he trained under Batman as well as other masters of martial arts, stealth, and detection that made him rival his former mentor.

      "    response=\"Hey, great question—building on what we just talked about with Batman's smarts and skills, Robin is essentially his trusted sidekick and partner in crime-fighting, forming what's often called the Dynamic Duo. Robin, first introduced as Dick Grayson (a young acrobat who lost his parents, much like Bruce Wayne), teams up with Batman to handle the dangers of Gotham, using agility, detective work, and tech to complement Batman's strengths. Over the years, the Robin mantle has been passed to others like Jason Todd or Tim Drake, each adding their own twist, but the core idea is about mentorship and teamwork—Batman guiding a younger hero to fight for justice.\\n\\nIf you're curious about how this dynamic plays out in stories, like Dick Grayson's evolution into Nightwing or how Robin's role has changed, I can dive deeper.

      "    cooperative_answer=\"Hey, that's a great follow-up question! In Game of Thrones, the Seven Kingdoms refer to the seven major regions of Westeros that were originally independent before being unified under one ruler. They were conquered and brought together by Aegon Targaryen about 300 years before the events of the series, forming the foundation of the Iron Throne's realm. Here's a quick breakdown to tie it into what we've talked about before:\\n\\n- **Historical Formation**: These kingdoms started as separate entities ruled by ancient houses, formed after the First Men settled Westeros and fought off threats like the White Walkers. The Andals invaded later, adding more layers to their culture, but it was Aegon the Conqueror who used his dragons to unite them into one realm, except for Dorne, which joined later through marriage.\\n\\n- **Rulers and Structure**: Each kingdom had its own ruling house, like the Starks in the North or the Lannisters in the Westerlands. After unification, the King or Queen on the Iron Throne (like Robert Baratheon or Cersei Lannister) ruled over all, but with local lords managing their regions. This setup is key to conflicts like the War of the Five Kings, which you asked about earlier—it's basically a massive civil war over who gets to control these kingdoms.\\n\\n- **Significance in the Story**: The Seven Kingdoms (now often called the Six Kingdoms after the North gained independence) drive a lot of the drama, showing themes of power, loyalty, and betrayal. It connects to things like the Red Wedding and the characters we've discussed, as the struggle for these lands shapes the entire narrative.\\n\\nIf you're curious about a specific kingdom, like the North or Dorne, or how this ties into the Five Kings, just let me know—I'm here to dive deeper and keep the conversation going!\",\n",

With the election of Brandon Stark as King of the Andals and the First Men in the Great Council of 305 AC , this title was replaced as Lord of the Six Kingdoms , to refer to the independence gained by Sansa Stark of the Kingdom of the North . Inspiration This is loosely comparable to how some real-life medieval monarchies continued to claim titles that they no longer possessed de facto . The kings of England styled themselves \"King of France\" long after the English had lost all their French territory and any prospect of reclaiming it, and \"Lord of Ireland\" when they had little practical control of the country. The oddity of the early Targaryen kings laying claim to Dorne is that, unlike English kings who lost territory in Ireland but still claimed it, the Targaryens never conquered Dorne, nor did they have any other real legal claim to it. In the books Every king of the Targaryen dynasty held the title \"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms\", dating back to Aegon the Conqueror himself, even though Aegon was never able to conquer Dorne . He thus only controlled six of the seven kingdoms plus the Riverlands , which historically has never been counted as one of the \"seven\". Dorne only joined the Targaryen realm through peaceful marriage-alliance fully two centuries after the War of Conquest (about one century before the War of the Five Kings ). When Aegon I began his conquest of Westeros, he unilaterally declared himself king and lord of all of the Seven Kingdoms, before proceeding to actually conquer kingdoms such as the Reach or the Westerlands . Aegon\\'s armies were repulsed from Dorne due to guerrilla warfare - but he never stopped claiming the title. Subsequent Targaryen kings continued to use the title \"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms\" as a tacit declaration that they still laid claim to Dorne and intended to conquer it eventually. A century and a half later, King Daeron I even managed to briefly conquer Dorne, but the occupation was thrown off and it remained independent for another half century.', 'Six Kingdoms Six Kingdoms Seven Kingdoms Location All of Westeros south of the Neck (formerly south of the Wall ) Type Feudal absolute elective monarchy Population Millions Culture Andals Dornishmen Hill tribes Ironborn Valyrians Northmen (minority as of 305 AC) Rulers Kings of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men Capital King\\'s Landing Religion Faith of the Seven (majority in the Six Kingdoms, including majority in the constituent regions of Dorne, the Reach, the Stormlands, the Vale of Arryn, the Westerlands, the Riverlands, and the Crownlands) Drowned God (majority in the Iron Islands ; minority in the Six Kingdoms, including majority in the constituent regions of Dorne, the Reach, the Stormlands, the Vale of Arryn, the Westerlands, the Riverlands, and the Crownlands) Old Gods of the Forest (minority in the Six Kingdoms) R\\'hllor, the Lord of Light (minority in the Six Kingdoms) Military Royal Fleet Individual military forces under the command of the noble Houses Institutions Alchemists\\' Guild Kingsguard Night\\'s Watch Order of Maesters Faith Militant (formerly) Places of note Casterly Rock · Dragonstone · The Eyrie · Gulltown · Harrenhal · Highgarden · Horn Hill · King\\'s Landing · Lannisport · Oldtown · Pyke · Riverrun · Storm\\'s End · Sunspear · The Twins · The Wall · White Harbor Date of founding 1 AC as a hereditary absolute monarchy Reformed in 305 AC as an absolute elective monarchy and renamed as the Six Kingdoms during the Great Council of 305 AC Formed from Kingdom of the North Kingdom of the Mountain and the Vale Kingdom of the Isles and the Rivers Kingdom of the Rock Kingdom of the Reach Kingdom of the Stormlands Principality of Dorne Narrow Sea islands Age 305 years Founder { Aegon the Conqueror } The Six Kingdoms , formerly known as the Seven Kingdoms , is the name given to the realm that controls southern Westeros and its numerous offshore islands, ruled by the King of the Andals and the First Men from the Red Keep in the city of King\\'s Landing . The name of the realm dates back to the time prior to the War of Conquest , during which seven independent kingdoms existed on the continent. The realm actually consists of nine distinct regions, the remaining two being formally established after the Targaryen conquest, and thus they are not actually considered to be \"kingdoms.\" Regardless, all nine provinces were subject to the rule of the Iron Throne . The realm has several times became fractured from years of civil warfare with the most recent resulting in the the Kingdom of the North and the Kingdom of the Iron Islands attempting secession. However, the North under Jon Snow had pledged to Daenerys of House Targaryen while the Iron Islands under Euron Greyjoy had allied with House Lannister . Both sides agreed to an armistice to deal with the Great War in the North, though Cersei Lannister and Euron Greyjoy betrayed the Starks and Targaryens. After the Great War was won, the war for Westeros resumed, and Daenerys and her forces took King\\'s Landing at the Battle of King\\'s Landing , though much of the population and structures were destroyed when she laid waste to the city. Daenerys was subsequently assassinated by Jon Snow to prevent more destruction. A great council elected a new king, Bran I the Broken , who allowed for the North under Sansa Stark to secede, resulting in the current Six Kingdoms under the control of King Brandon Stark and the independent North under Queen Sansa Stark.

These were: Kingdom of the North , ruled by House Stark of Winterfell , the Kings in the North . Now independent and active again. Kingdom of the Mountain and the Vale , ruled by House Arryn of the Eyrie , the Kings of the Mountain and the Vale . Kingdom of the Isles and the Rivers , ruled by House Hoare of Harrenhal , the Kings of the Isles and the Rivers . Kingdom of the Rock , ruled by House Lannister of Casterly Rock , the Kings of the Rock . Kingdom of the Stormlands , ruled by House Durrandon of Storm\\'s End , the Storm Kings . Kingdom of the Reach , ruled by House Gardener of Highgarden , the Kings of the Reach . Principality of Dorne , ruled by House Martell of Sunspear , the Princes of Dorne . Note that being referred to as a principality was purely stylistic; Dorne was an independent kingdom in all but name. With the aid of his dragons , Aegon managed to conquer all of the kingdoms, except Dorne , which would join with his dynasty through marriage a century later. Houses Stark, Lannister, and Arryn, which bent the knee to Aegon, were allowed to maintain their domains, no longer as kings but as Lords Paramount of their respective regions - the North , the Westerlands and the Vale - and Wardens , subject to the authority of the King of the Andals and the First Men . With House Hoare eliminated, the kingdom ruled by Harren the Black was divided, with the people of the Iron Islands choosing House Greyjoy as their rulers, lands surrounding the Trident awarded to House Tully as lords of the Riverlands , and the lords of lands surrounding the new capital of King\\'s Landing as direct vassals to the Iron Throne . House Gardener was also obliterated when King Mern IX perished at the Field of Fire . Mern\\'s steward, Harlen Tyrell , surrendered Highgarden and the Reach to the Targaryen conqueror and was thus appointed Lord of Highgarden , Lord Paramount of the Reach , and Warden of the South . House Durrandon was extinguished in the male line when King Argilac was killed by Orys Baratheon in battle . As a reward for his loyalty, Orys was granted Argilac\\'s domain, as well as his daughter . Thus House Baratheon , the Lords Paramount of the Stormlands and new Lords of Storm\\'s End , was created. The only one of the Seven Kingdoms not conquered was Dorne in the far south, whose lords learned from the mistakes of the other kings and refused to meet Aegon and his dragons in open battle. Dorne retained their independence for almost two more centuries before joining the realm through a dual marriage with the Targaryens . Because they entered the realm through a marital alliance and not conquest, the Dornish rulers of House Martell have been allowed to continue to style themselves as princes and princesses rather than Lords Paramount, though they are still subject to the authority of the Iron Throne and are not considered to be royalty. Despite numerous civil wars, rebellions, and the death of the last of the dragons , the Targaryens ruled over the unified Seven Kingdoms for over 280 years, some of which saw peace and prosperity, until the actions of the Mad King, Aerys II , triggered the rebellion known as Robert\\'s Rebellion . At the end of this civil war, King Aerys II and most of his family were slain and his surviving children fled into exile in the Free Cities across the Narrow Sea on the continent of Essos . Robert Baratheon took the throne and ruled for seventeen years, beginning a new dynasty whose rule became challenged after his death. Cersei Lannister , the widow and murderer of Robert, took the throne after the civil war, beginning the Lannister dynasty. However, her rule is quickly contested by the last known Targaryen: Daenerys Targaryen , who brings with her the three dragons like Aegon had, the first dragons born in over a century. Jon Snow , the new King in the North , sought to unite the fractured kingdoms against a common enemy: the White Walkers , who have been gone for 8,000 years since the first Long Night . He struggles to do so as most of the realm believes the White Walkers to be fairy tales, and, as a result, went on an expedition beyond the Wall with allies to gather proof of their reawakening. House Targaryen and House Stark united in the Great War , which House Lannister sat out of despite promising to contribute , and defeated the White Walkers in the Battle of Winterfell . Afterwards, they defeated House Lannister at the Battle of King\\'s Landing , though King\\'s Landing was left in ruins. After the assassination of Daenerys Targaryen by Jon Snow, the Unsullied leave the lords of the great noble Houses to elect a new ruler. In the Great Council of 305 AC the remaining Houses unanimously vote for Bran Stark to be the new king and they agree that future monarchs would be elected the same manner. However, House Stark declares the independence of the Kingdom of the North, which is uncontested and accepted by Bran. As the new Hand of the King, Tyrion Lannister leads the small council in the reconstruction of King\\'s Landing. Government The Seven Kingdoms were originally ruled as an absolute monarchy, but have since been reorganized to be ruled as an elective monarchy ruled by a King or Queen, who bears the titles of \" King of the Andals and the First Men \", \" Lord of the Seven Kingdoms \", and \" Protector of the Realm .\" The second most powerful position is that of the Hand of the King , an appointed Lord who serves as the monarch\\'s topmost advisor and, in his absence, holds court and may even sit on the Iron Throne. If the King is a minor and, thus, unfit to properly rule, the government falls in the hands of a Regent , who may be the Hand, the Queen Dowager or another Lord selected for the task. Aiding the King and the Hand in the capital is the small council , a chamber of Lords that advise the King and/or the Hand in matters such as economy, intelligence or law. The permanent small council positions are: The Master of Laws The Master of Coin The Master of Ships The Master of War The Master of Whisperers The Grand Maester The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard The King may appoint other advisors to the council at his discretion, but they hold no official office (they operate \" without portfolio \"). Administrative regions Beneath the King of the Andals and the First Men , the Hand of the King , and the small council , but still enjoying a great degree of autonomy, are the rulers of each region. They are almost all referred to as Lords Paramount of their respective region, with the only two exceptions being Dorne , the ruler being referred to as the Prince of Dorne , and the Iron Islands , the ruler being referred to as the Lord of the Iron Islands . The Lords Paramount are the paternal heads of the Great Houses ; each Great House rules a region. Additionally, some Lords Paramount bear the title of Warden , who are regional commanders sworn to defend the realm from threats posed in and around their region. The four Wardens are the Wardens of the North, the Wardens of the West, the Wardens of the East, and the Wardens of the South. Below the rulers of each constituent region lie their vassals : lords and landed knights, who rule in the name of their liege lords and are sworn to answer their summons when the need arises. These lords may have, in turn, their own lords and sworn knights ruling over portions of their own lands. The lowest in the social ladder are the smallfolk , or commoners, who make up the majority of the population. As of the War of the Five Kings and the conflicts that followed, the Seven Kingdoms are currently fractured. The civil war left House Baratheon extinct, leaving the Stormlands without ruler. It also led to the extinction of House Frey in the male line, which had usurped power from House Tully , leaving the Riverlands in anarchy. The North , the Vale , and the Iron Islands are in open rebellion against the Iron Throne , while in Dorne , the Sand Snakes have seized power after staging a coup d\\'etat against House Martell . Additionally, Dorne, the Reach , and part of the Iron Islands have declared for a rival claimant to the Iron Throne, which is currently occupied by House Lannister after the extinction of House Baratheon: the sole survivor of the ousted House Targaryen . However, Daenerys Targaryen\\'s war for Westeros has further seen the extinction of House Tyrell and the imprisonment or deaths of the leading Sand Snakes, leaving the Reach and Dorne without ruler. The following table goes in descending order from north to south of Westeros .

Previously independent under Kings Robb Stark 298–300 AC and Jon Snow 303–304 AC, as well as prior to the War of Conquest . Justice In the Seven Kingdoms, justice is administered by the King and/or lords. Penalties for crimes may include scourging, mutilation, castration, excessive tickling, or imprisonment. South of the Neck , where Andal culture is prevalent, punishments are carried out by headsmen, executioners - like the King\\'s Justice in the capital - or knights carrying out the will of their lords. In the North , however, where the ways of the First Men are prevalent, it is expected for lords to carry out sentences personally. Treason and rebellion may be punished in several ways, such as hanging or beheading, but also by exile or being stripped of lands and titles - which may also extend to the entire family of the one attainted . In the case of nobles, the taking of a close family member, such as a son or daughter, as hostage for the noble\\'s good behavior is also commonplace. Slavery or slave trading is also forbidden, and punishable by death. Thieving and smuggling are usually punished by mutilation through amputating a hand, while rapists are subject to castration. Bearing arms against a liege lord or refusing to answer a liege lord\\'s summons is also considered a capital offense. Suspects of crimes are judged by lords or by the King himself. Parties may invoke a trial by combat to prove the justice of their positions. Both parties may fight themselves or name a champion to represent them. The victorious party is held to have been judged to be right by the Seven . Any criminal, however, may join the Night\\'s Watch to avoid punishment. Those who choose to \"take the black\" are beyond the reach of law, even a King\\'s edict, as long as they swear the oath to serve the Watch until death. The punishment for desertion, just as in the case of treason, is death. Economy and currency Monetary transactions in the Seven Kingdoms use a form of minted coin currency known as the Gold Dragon, and its various denominations, such as the Silver Stag and Copper Penny. The feudal society of the Seven Kingdoms has a primarily agrarian economy. Surplus food supports the populations of the five major cities and the various large towns. The five major cities are, in decreasing order of size: King\\'s Landing, Oldtown, Lannisport, Gulltown, and White Harbor. The Reach and the Riverlands are the two main breadbasket regions, which have such fertile and productive farmland that they not only meet their local needs but can export foodstuffs to the other kingdoms. The Reach is also a major wine-producing region, and in particular, contains the Arbor , a large island off the southern coast of Westeros which is the main wine-producing hub for the entire realm. The Crownlands are more or less lumped in with the Riverlands in this regard, as they were created only three centuries ago when Aegon I Targaryen carved them out from disputed regions of the eastern Riverlands which neighboring kingdoms were fighting over. The Crownlands are not explicitly said to export food, but rather, are needed to deal with the large food demands of the capital city, as King\\'s Landing is the largest city on the continent. The Reach and the Riverlands feed the realm, but the Westerlands enrich it. The largest goldmines in Westeros are located in the Westerlands, and indeed, most of the precious metal mines in the Seven Kingdoms are concentrated there. Conversely, the mountainous but metal-rich Westerlands are not as fertile as other regions, so they trade gold and precious metals to more fertile regions such as the Reach and the Riverlands in exchange for their surplus food. Although agriculturally self-sufficient, the North has few exports and a smaller population, but its main contribution to the overall economy of the realm is considered to be security. The North is a vast geographical buffer that stands between the southern kingdoms and raiding wildling bands which might try to invade the rich lands of southern Westeros from Beyond the Wall . As a cold region, it also possesses animals with heavy furs which are not present in warmer regions to the south, and shepherds produce heavy wools. Dorne remained independent for a full two centuries after the Targaryen Conquest, and only came under the authority of the Iron Throne one hundred years ago through peaceful marriage-alliance. Thus it is not quite as interconnected through trade as the other kingdoms are. Moreover, due to the imposing Red Mountains at the base of the Dorne peninsula, and the forbidding deserts of central Dorne, overland transport to and from Dorne is fairly difficult, so there are no major roads linking it to the other kingdoms. However, a considerable amount of trade still occurs by sea, as well as some land-based trade using caravans across the desert. The dry deserts of Dorne might not produce large quantities of food to export, however, the irrigated river-valleys allow for a fair amount of agriculture. Because Dorne is so climatically and ecologically different from the rest of Westeros, exotic crops grow there which don\\'t grow in the rest of the continent, particularly citrus fruits and olives, as well as spices (both grown locally and obtained from the nearby Free Cities ). The lemons for Sansa Stark \\'s prized lemon cakes originate in Dorne. Because so many exotic foodstuffs are available, Dornish wine is very flavorful and different from the wines of the Reach. Noblemen across the Seven Kingdoms who claim a refined palate enjoy the exotic taste of sour Dornish red wine. Thus while Dorne doesn\\'t produce much in the way of basic foodstuffs, it does produce many exotic luxury foods (i.e. citrus fruits) which are not produced anywhere else in the realm - which means that Dorne still conducts brisk trade with the rest of the Seven Kingdoms in exchange for its unique products. Not much has been said about the economic capacities of the Stormlands and the Vale of Arryn. Parts of the Stormlands are fertile enough, such as the coastal regions and the northern half around Storm\\'s End. Otherwise, the Stormlands are the most heavily forested region in southern Westeros, containing two of the three major forests in the realm, the Rainwood and the Kingswood (the Kingswood spills over into the Crownlands). The third major forest is the Wolfswood in the North, but even the North cannot claim such a dense concentration of forests as the Stormlands. It stands to reason that the Stormlands can produce a fairly large amount of timber (compared to the deserts of Dorne), but otherwise, it is not one of the wealthier kingdoms. The Vale, while fairly mountainous, does not possess the precious metal reserves that the Westerlands have. However, many of the well-watered valleys of the mountains are actually quite fertile, and the Vale can produce a sufficient amount of food to support its population, without having to heavily rely on imported food. This contributes to the Vale\\'s frequent tactic of choosing isolationism in times of political turmoil, closing the mountain passes that connect it to the rest of the realm. While the Westerlands might find it difficult to feed its population if cut off from food imports, the Vale can survive reasonably well without imports. Last and least, the Iron Islands are a dead weight carried by the other kingdoms. Lightly populated, infertile rocks, it is no wonder why their population turned to a lifestyle of piracy and raiding. They are swept by fierce, cold storm winds from the seas, with poor soil and hardly any natural resources. The few poor crop fields that are present have their rocky soil plowed by thralls , men captured in raids and forced into servitude, as they usually cannot even afford draft animals. The one natural resource the Iron Islands actually possess are, of course, iron mines - but they do not produce precious metals. The seas around the islands, however, are abundant with fish, thus most of their local economy is based on subsistence fishing. The Targaryen kings forbade the ironborn to raid in the Seven Kingdoms themselves anymore, but they continued to raid foreign merchant vessels and shores, which provides at least some influx of wealth and thralls. The Seven Kingdoms also conduct vigorous foreign trade, particularly with the nearby Free Cities across the Narrow Sea in Essos . Trade products from the Seven Kingdoms can find their way even further east, and wine merchants as far east as the markets of the Dothraki city of Vaes Dothrak can be seen selling Arbor gold wine from the Reach. The trade networks the Seven Kingdoms are part of extend even to Qarth in the distant east: House Lannister of the Westerlands is noted as being one of the largest customers of the silk merchants\\' guild in Qarth. Spices and various other exotic products also find their way to the Seven Kingdoms through the international trade network. Because slavery is illegal in the Seven Kingdoms, however, and abhorred by every major religion in Westeros, they do not take part in the international slave trade. Military The Seven Kingdoms does not possess a large standing military force, as do some of the Free Cities . Instead, each lord permanently maintains only a relatively small retinue of well-trained and well-equipped personal knights and warriors. In wartime they function on the principle of feudal levies, with each lord raising his own armies from the commoners who live on his lands. Sometimes they can provide these levies with reasonably standardized and good quality armor and weapons - though sometimes, they are little more than peasants wielding sharpened farming tools, clubs and staves, or a board with a nail in it. These are usually supported by archers, or even crossbowmen. Each lord raises a military force from his vassals on behalf of his or her own superior lord. These \"bannermen\" march under the war banners of their overlord, combining their strength with his own. For example, House Stark draws soldiers from the lands immediately around Winterfell , but then adds to these knights and footsoldiers from the lands of House Umber , who in turn have their own minor bannermen. This hierarchy extends up to the King on the Iron Throne. The regions of Westeros vary considerably in population and wealth, dramatically affecting the number and quality of the soldiers that can be raised. The King on the Iron Throne does appoint four \" Wardens \" who are meant to command and coordinate regional armies when in times of crisis, when bannermen and levies are called up. The regional lords in that quarter of the realm are expected to put their armies at the overall command of the Warden in their quarter of the realm. The Warden of the North guards against wildling attacks from beyond the Wall, the Warden of the East guards against attack from across the Narrow Sea, and so on. The Seven Kingdoms also employ a large number of naval forces . The three main fleets are the Royal Fleet (stationed in the east at King\\'s Landing and Dragonstone island), the Redwyne Fleet (at the Arbor in the southwest), and the Iron Fleet of the ironborn (in the west). Culture The culture and customs of the Seven Kingdoms are heavily influenced by the dominant ethnicity in each of its constituent regions. Four major cultural groups or regions can be distinguished. The influence of the Andal culture is stronger in \"the south\", namely in the Vale, Riverlands, Westerlands, the Reach, the Stormlands, the Crownlands, and some parts of Dorne. It is in these regions where the tradition of knighthood is more prevalent. The Northmen, meanwhile, continue to practice the customs and culture of the First Men . For example, whereas in the south the execution of criminals is carried out by headsmen and executioners, in the North tradition holds that \"he who passes the sentence should swing the sword.\" Despite being blood of both the Andals and the First Men, the people of the Iron Islands developed their own cultural identity. With strong ties to the sea, the Ironborn culture is centered around activities such as piracy and raiding. They believe they have the right to seize by force what they consider necessary - \"paying the \\' iron price \\'.\" The Dornishmen, for their part, also retain their own cultural identity, heavily influenced by their intermingling with the Rhoynar people of Essos . Dornishmen practice equal primogeniture and have a reputation for sexual licentiousness. Major religions Three major religions are followed by large numbers of people in the Seven Kingdoms. By far the most dominant is the Faith of the Seven, after the Andal invaders brought it to the continent 6,000 years ago, pushing out worship of the Old Gods of the Forest. The North remained independent from the Andals so the worship of the Old Gods remained strong there, with only a few pockets of followers in the rest of the kingdoms. The Iron Islands have followed their local religion of the Drowned God since before recorded history, and though some Andals settled there the Faith of the Seven never gained a significant foothold in the isles. The relations between the different religions in Westeros settled into a grudging co-existence many centuries ago. The Old Gods of the Forest The old nature gods worshiped by the Children of the Forest and later the First Men. Still worshiped by the people of the North and a few isolated others, particularly ancient noble Houses, in the south of Westeros. The old gods are numerous and nameless. Prayers and offerings are made to the old gods in front of heart trees ; great weirwood trees with faces carved into the bark. Its followers believe that the Old Gods can see through the heart trees, which caused the Andals to cut down most heart trees in southern Westeros. The Faith of the Seven The Faith of the Seven was brought to Westeros by the Andals. The Faith contends there is one god consisting of seven separate aspects : the Mother, the Father, the Warrior, the Smith, the Maiden, the Crone, and the Stranger. People worship the Seven in seven-sided churches called septs and are led in worship by priests and priestesses known as \"septons\" and \"septas.\" The Faith is not only a belief system but also an institution led by the High Septon from the Great Sept of Baelor in King\\'s Landing. The Faith has traditionally not been very tolerant of other religions but this was relaxed somewhat after centuries of coexistence with the remaining followers of the Old Gods and the Drowned God. When the Rhoynar migrated to Dorne a thousand years ago they converted to the Faith of the Seven, but often simply ignored rules they didn\\'t like. The modern Dornishmen have somewhat relaxed sexual mores, attaching no stigma to bastard children, homosexuality, or formal mistresses . While they follow some of the rules of the Faith of the Seven more loosely, however, the Dornishmen are no less devout. The Drowned God The Iron Islands, separated from the mainland, possesses its own local religion which is not practiced anywhere else in Westeros. The ironborn worship a harsh deity known as the Drowned God, a deity which favors and allegedly rewards those who undertake reaving, war, and plunder in his name, and whose enemy is the Storm God . The most fanatical worshipers of the Drowned God are \"drowned\" in salt water and, if worthy, are then revived by the Drowned God\\'s priests . Both in number of adherents and range, the local worship of the Drowned God is much smaller than either the Old Gods or the Faith of the Seven, to the point that when people on the mainland take oaths, they often swear \"by the Old Gods [of the Forest] and the New [the Seven]\" without mention of the Drowned God. The Lord of Light The Lord of Light is a god popular in Essos who is little-known in Westeros. According to its clergy, the red priests , the Lord of Light is the guardian of humanity against darkness, cold and death. He is a merciless god who often demands harsh sacrifices of his followers, but also rewards his true followers with power and life. The Lord of Light has failed to gain a foothold in Westeros in the past thousands of years, and is considered a \"foreign religion\" from the eastern continent. Still, travelers and migrants from the eastern continent who are currently living in Westeros, often in the major cities like King\\'s Landing, may be encountered in Westeros who worship the Lord of Light. Due to Stannis Baratheon \\'s recent conversion to the Lord of Light religion, many of his followers from Dragonstone island and other islands of the Crownlands lying in Blackwater Bay have also converted to the worship of the Lord of Light.', 'Faith of the Seven Type Monotheism (seven aspects of one god) Clergy Septons (male) Septas (female) Location Seven Kingdoms (minority in the North and the Iron Islands) Leader High Septon (currently vacant) Center Starry Sept Great Sept of Baelor , King\\'s Landing (formerly) The Faith of the Seven , also commonly referred to as the New Gods , is the main religion of the Seven Kingdoms . It is little-practiced beyond its borders. The Faith of the Seven is dominant in the south of Westeros . The only regions where it is not the majority religion are the North , where worship of the Old Gods of the Forest remains strong, and on the Iron Islands , where the local religion of the Drowned God is most widespread. There are many exceptions in these areas, however. The faith, its influence and following were all greatly damaged due to the destruction of its center , the Great Sept of Baelor by wildfire , as a part of a plot organized by Cersei Lannister .

Afterward the Andals sailed west and their invasion of Westeros began. Some of the Andal warriors carved the seven-pointed star, the symbol of their religion, into their flesh to demonstrate their devotion. Bearing weapons made of steel, the Andals conquered the First Men and slaughtered the Children of the Forest , viewing their magic as an abomination before the Seven. The Andals burned down most of the weirwood trees in the south, which are considered sacred in the worship of the Old Gods of the Forest . Soon all the kingdoms of the First Men, with the exception of the Kingdom of the North , fell to the invaders, who intermingled with some of the local dynasties, such as House Gardener , or replaced them altogether, as was the case of Mountain Kings of the Vale . As the Andals asserted their dominance over all regions south of the Neck , they asserted their religion over the First Men they conquered, replacing the worship of the Old Gods almost entirely throughout the southern kingdoms of Westeros. Thus the Andals\\' Faith of the Seven became the dominant religion on the entire continent, except for in the North and the Iron Islands. Prior to the rule of House Targaryen , the Faith had the right to dispense justice, conduct inquests and trials and pass judgement over all echelons of society, including kings. This justice was enforced by the Faith Militant . However, this right was taken away from it by the Targaryen kings and, whilst the Faith remained an important part of Westerosi customs, they grew corrupt and their practices became little more than a façade. Nevertheless, the Faith\\'s importance could not be understated and most if not all noble Houses had a septa present in their household to raise their daughters, such as Septa Mordane for House Stark (due to the influence of Catelyn Stark , who firmly believed in the Gods, despite the fact that she had married into a Northern family which worshiped the Old Gods ). Season 5 As a result of the devastation of the War of the Five Kings , a growing disillusionment with the nobility grew among the smallfolk . Progressively, they begun to turn to the Faith for comfort and safety, specifically in the aftermath of the Red Wedding , during which House Frey broke the sacred guest right . A new religious cult emerged from this disillusioned mass, who called themselves Sparrows . The Sparrows believed that all, high and lowborn alike, were equal in the eyes of the Gods and that they shouldn\\'t tolerate their excesses anymore. After Tywin Lannister \\'s death, the Sparrows arrived in King\\'s Landing and begun spreading their message to the Kingslanders as well as tending to the poorest in the city. Even some highborn, such as Lancel Lannister , joined the new cult. Sometime after their arrival, the Sparrows forced the High Septon to perform a walk of penance through King\\'s Landing after they found him in a brothel, mocking the Gods. When the High Septon appealed to the small council to have the Sparrows arrested and their leader, the High Sparrow , executed, the Queen Mother, Cersei Lannister , arrested the High Septon instead. Cersei then had the High Sparrow elected as the new High Septon and told him that she planned to give the Faith back the power it had lost to the Targaryens. This includes rearming the Faith Militant and allowing the Faith to wield judiciary power. With the restoration of these rights, the High Sparrow arms his Sparrows as the new Faith Militant and sends them to destroy alehouses, brothels, idols of other religions and to arrest anyone believed to have broken the holy laws. Thanks to Cersei, they learn of Loras Tyrell \\'s homosexuality and arrest him. A holy inquest is held into Loras\\'s \\'sins\\' and is attended by King Tommen Baratheon , Queen Margaery Tyrell ; Loras\\'s sister; Lady Olenna Tyrell and Cersei Lannister. During the inquest, Loras is ordered to stand trial due to Olyvar \\'s testimony and Margaery is also arrested for perjuring herself to save her brother. A few days later, Cersei is also arrested on charges of incest, adultery and the murder of King Robert Baratheon , charges which are due to the testimony of Lancel Lannister, her former lover. Though Cersei is defiant at first, she eventually confesses her adultery with Lancel in order to be reunited with her son King Tommen. The High Sparrow grants her request but says that there will still be a trial to ascertain the truth behind the other charges that she denies: incest and regicide . Cersei is then forced to walk naked through the streets of Kings Landing from the Great Sept of Baelor to the Red Keep amidst the leering and jeering crowds who have gathered to see her shame and take the chance to insult their hated Queen Mother. Season 6 The High Sparrow still holds Loras and Margaery Tyrell captive. Margaery\\'s grandmother, Olenna Tyrell, and her father, Mace Tyrell, are determined to get her out, along with her husband King Tommen. Tommen visits the High Sparrow several times, first in hostility, but soon begins talking and listening to the High Sparrow. Under severe psychological torture, Margaery confesses her sins. When King Tommen visits Margaery, he is surprised to find her talking positively about the High Sparrow. He finds himself agreeing with her about the High Sparrow. Later, Mace Tyrell leads a faction of the Tyrell army through the streets of King\\'s Landing to a waiting Jaime Lannister. Together, they proceed to the Great Sept, outside which the High Sparrow, Septa Unella, the Faith Militant and a large crowd of city folk are preparing for Margaery\\'s Walk of Atonement. The army arrives, along with Olenna Tyrell in a litter, as the High Sparrow is speaking, and Jaime demands he release Margaery and Loras, before they can \"be on their way.\" The High Sparrow refuses and fends off Jaime\\'s threats to kill all the Sparrows by saying each Sparrow yearns to die in the service of the Gods. After a tense few moments he proclaims it will not be necessary, as there will be no Walk of Atonement. Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the faith. To Jaime\\'s astonishment the doors of the Sept open and King Tommen emerges, escorted by his own guards, and walks down the steps to join the High Sparrow and Margaery in a demonstration of unity between the crown and the faith. He explains that there is a new alliance between the crown and the faith. The crowd burst into cheers after Tommen\\'s speech, demonstrating that the High Sparrow now has the support of both the crown and the smallfolk. Jaime is later sent away from King\\'s Landing, to Riverrun , in order to deal with Brynden \"the Blackfish\" Tully , who had retaken it in the name of House Tully , and Robb Stark\\'s Kingdom of the North against House Frey. This is presumably part of the High Sparrow\\'s plan to weaken Cersei by removing Jaime from the capital. King Tommen announces that the trials of his mother and of Loras Tyrell will be held on the first day of the Festival of the Mother. He further decrees that trial by combat is outlawed and that people tried by the faith will face seven septons as it was in the early days. On the day of the trials, many people are assembled in the Great Sept, including Kevan Lannister , the High Sparrow, Mace Tyrell , Queen Margaery, and Ser Loras. The High Sparrow begins Loras\\' trial, but he confesses to his crimes and opts to become a servant of the Faith, forsaking his name, lordship, and claim to Highgarden. The High Sparrow accepts and Loras is made a brother of the Faith Militant. Cersei and Tommen are not present and Margaery becomes concerned, telling the High Sparrow then the audience that they need to leave. The Faith Militant bar anyone from the exits and all assembled perish when a cache of wildfire beneath the building is detonated. The Great Sept of Baelor is completely destroyed, along with the entire Faith Militant, completely shattering the faith\\'s power. Beliefs The Faith holds that there is one god who has seven faces or aspects: the Father, the Mother, the Maiden, the Crone, the Warrior, the Smith, and the Stranger. Each aspect represents one part of life or existence. The Father : represents divine justice, and judges the souls of the dead. The Mother : represents mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth. She is sometimes referred to as \"the strength of women\". The Maiden : represents purity, innocence, love, and beauty. The Crone : represents wisdom and foresight. She is represented carrying a lantern. The Warrior : represents strength and courage in battle. The Smith : represents creation and craftsmanship. The Stranger : The Stranger represents death and the unknown. It is rarely prayed to. The Stranger is depicted as neither male nor female, thus the number of male and female aspects within the godhead is equal: three males (Father, Warrior, Smith), three females (Maiden, Mother, Crone), and one who is neither. Unlike the other aspects which are represented as human figures in artwork, because the Stranger represents the unknown it is often portrayed in a wide variety of forms, often frightening. Sometimes it is represented as a skeletal figure, or a non-human creature possessing various animalistic features. Due to its seven \"aspects\", the deity is often referred to as the \" Seven-faced God \" or the \" God of Seven \", but most frequently as simply \" the Seven \". The Seven are also referred to as \" the New Gods \" or \" New God \", in contrast with the \"Old Gods\" of the Forest worshiped by the First Men before the invasion of the Andals. In practice, many devotees will refer to the aspects as \"Gods\" plural, though priests of the Faith will attempt to stress the theological nuance to their followers that there is indeed only one God, the \"Seven-in-One\" deity. This has not stopped the commonly heard exclamation \"Gods be good!\" from being used pervasively throughout the Seven Kingdoms. Due to the \"Seven-in-One\" nature of the deity, the number seven is sacred in the religion, with symbolism involving the number seven featuring heavily in its belief system. Newborn babies are anointed with seven oils and named in the light of the Seven the day they are born. In death, the Faith believes that there are Seven Heavens and Seven Hells. The exclaimed curse \"Seven Hells!\" is commonly heard in Westeros. The Seven Pointed Star is the most prominent symbol of the Faith, representing how each of the seven aspects is one facet of a unified whole. This is used as an allegory to explain the complex theological concept of a single God composed of Seven persons: just as the star has seven points, but all points are part of the same star, so too is there only one deity, which appears to men in seven different ways. The Faith also holds to the belief that, just as there are seven aspects of their deity, it also preaches the existence of seven heavens and, likewise, seven hells. \" Practices Styles of worship Unlike the Old Gods of the Forest , whose worshipers in the North are looked down upon by members of the Faith of the Seven as savages who worship multiple gods, the Faith is based on a number of holy texts and complex social rules. The central holy text of the religion is The Seven-Pointed Star . Temples of the Faith are seven-sided buildings known as \" Septs \", with each wall dedicated to one of the seven aspects. Followers of the Faith gather in septs for group prayer, which frequently involves singing hymns of praise to the Seven. One such hymn dedicated to the Mother is \" Gentle Mother, Font of Mercy \". There are also monasteries, known as \"septries\", where smaller numbers of worshipers gather who have taken a monastic oath. Septries often have vows of silence or other requirements, and are places of quiet contemplation. Knighthood Mounted warriors known as knights dedicate themselves to a code of behavior known as chivalry, heavily influenced by the Faith of the Seven and its principles. The will of the Seven is said to favor the victor in a trial by combat . Social rules Along with the Old Gods, the Faith shares several basic social rules against incest , kinslaying , and bastardy . The Faith of the Seven, along with all major religions, also upholds the laws of hospitality , which hold sacred the good behavior of a guest and host towards each other. The Faith of the Seven considers homosexuality to be a sin, albeit one of lesser severity than incest or kinslaying. Therefore, homosexuals in the Seven Kingdoms such as Ser Loras Tyrell and Renly Baratheon must keep their true sexual and romantic behavior secret, or else face significant social consequences. Only members of House Targaryen are permitted to practice incest in order to \"keep the bloodline pure\", after the Faith was forced to turn a blind eye towards the incest after the. Faith Militant uprising . There are no different denominations within the Faith of the Seven, as all adherents are part of one universal organization. However, different regions of the Seven Kingdoms may interpret and apply its rules more or less strictly than others, particularly Dorne . When the Rhoynar migrated to Dorne a thousand years ago, they brought with them their own social customs from their river-based city-states on the continent of Essos . The Rhoynar converted to the Faith of the Seven, but in many ways they picked and chose which parts of the religion they liked and simply ignored the parts they didn\\'t want to follow. Thus the present-day Dornishmen who descend from them follow the rules of the Faith somewhat loosely. In particular, the Rhoynar were quite tolerant of sexual behavior including homosexuality, and thus homosexuality or bisexuality carries little if any social taint in present-day Dorne, even though they are still nominally followers of the Faith of the Seven. Thus while a knight from the Reach such as Ser Loras Tyrell must hide his homosexuality, several major lords and ladies in Dorne are openly bisexual or homosexual - such as Oberyn Martell and Ellaria Sand . The Rhoynar also had much less disdain for bastards than the peoples already established in Westeros when they arrived. While bastards in present-day Dorne do have to use the bastard surname \"Sand\" and are less likely to inherit, it is actually not unusual to see bastards living at the court of their noble parents there. Wedding Ceremonies Unlike the faith of the Old Gods of the Forest , which lacks elaborate ceremonies, weddings under the auspices of the Faith of the Seven are elaborate and highly ritualized. These ceremonies typically take place inside of a sept and are presided over by a septon. At the beginning of the ceremony, the bride is escorted to the altar by her father where the groom and the septon await. The groom is then told, \"You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection\" and drapes a cloak bearing his house\\'s colors around the bride\\'s shoulders. The bride and groom then join hands, which are tied together with a ribbon by the septon, who says, \"In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one, for eternity.\" He then instructs them to, \"Look upon one another and say the words.\" At this point, the bride and groom turn to face each other are recite the following vow in unison: \"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger, I am his/hers and she/he is mine from this day until the end of my days.\" Deviations from this ritual do occur sometimes. Owing in large part to its spur-of-the-moment, secret nature and the characters\\' remote location at the time, the wedding of Robb Stark and Talisa Maegyr takes place outside instead of inside a sept. It also appears that Robb did not cloak Talisa - possibly because he did not have a cloak available. Talisa is also not given away by her father, who was not present or anyone else for that matter. By contrast, Sansa Stark is given away at her wedding but not by her father , who had been executed beforehand. Instead, King Joffrey Baratheon , as \"the Father of the Realm,\" takes it upon himself to give Sansa away. Organization Unlike the worship of the Old Gods, the Faith of the Seven has an organized clergy with a complex internal hierarchy. Both men and women can be priests of the Seven. Male priests are known as septons and female priests as septas . The head of the Faith is known as the High Septon , who resides at the headquarters of the Faith of the Seven, the Great Sept of Baelor , which is located in the capital city King\\'s Landing . The ruling council of the Faith is known as the Most Devout , who also reside in the Great Sept. The Most Devout rank just below the High Septon, but are responsible for electing a new High Septon when the current one dies. There are several monastic or devotional orders that believers in the Faith of the Seven may belong to. One of the most prominent of these is the Silent Sisters , a separate all-female monastic order devoted to the Stranger, the aspect that represents death. The Silent Sisters are responsible for dressing and preparing dead bodies for funeral rites, and have taken vows of silence and chastity. Silent Sisters are separate from the regular clergy, and are not considered to be septas. Quotes In the books Author George R.R. Martin has stated that the Faith of the Seven in the A Song of Ice and Fire novels is loosely analogous, at least in social function, to the medieval Catholic Church. Martin himself was raised Roman Catholic but by the time of the TV series, describes himself as a \"lapsed Catholic\". He borrowed the idea of the three-in-one Holy Trinity (Father-Son-Holy Ghost) and modified it into a \"Holy Septinity\" of sorts when he made the seven-in-one god of the Faith of the Seven. When Aegon the Conqueror invaded and subdued Westeros three centuries ago, he gained the support of the Faith, who crowned him King and convinced the rulers of the city of Oldtown to open their gates to him. The Faith\\'s support was critical to Aegon taking control of the continent. However, when he died and his son Aenys (born of incest, which is proscribed by the Faith) took the throne, they led a religious uprising against him. This uprising was eventually crushed by the Targaryen dynasty with great loss of life, when the weakling Aenys died and was succeeded by his ruthless brother Maegor the Cruel . Peace was reached when Maegor died and was succeeded by Aenys\\' son Jaehaerys, who brokered a peace agreement: the Faith didn\\'t have to actively support the incestuous marriage practices of the Targaryens, but it did have to at least acknowledge the marriages as valid, and the Faith\\'s leadership accepted the offer. The Faith\\'s military forces, the Faith Militant, disbanded and the Faith have remained loyal supporters of the crown ever since. Many septons and septas are based at a sept or septry, but \"begging brothers\", septons without a sept, wander the Seven Kingdoms and minister to smaller towns and villages which lack septs of their own. This is analogous to medieval friars. Similar to the real-life College of Cardinals in Catholicism, the Faith is ruled over by a council known as the Most Devout , which elects the High Septon. New High Septons are usually selected from among the members of the Most Devout, but this is not a requirement. While septons and septas serve on the council of the Most Devout, the High Septon is usually male. It hasn\\'t been mentioned if there is an actual rule against electing a \"High Septa\" and there has never been one, or if there were High Septas in the past, and one simply hasn\\'t been elected during the timeframe of the novels.', 'SPOILER WARNING This article includes content relating to the Dance of the Dragons, and therefore contains potential spoilers for House of the Dragon , as revealed in GRRM\\'s writings. Anyone wishing to remain completely spoiler free for the new show should avoid any articles displaying this tag. The King of the Andals and the First Men (feminine equivalent being Queen of the Andals and the First Men ), also referred to as the King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men (feminine equivalent being Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men ), is the monarch and head of state of the Six Kingdoms . The monarch formerly ruled as the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the unified realm which made up the entire continent of Westeros with the exception of the lands beyond the Wall in the frozen north. Until its destruction, the monarch of the unified Kingdoms sat on the Iron Throne in the capital city King\\'s Landing in the royal palace known as the Red Keep . In the aftermath of the Battle of King\\'s Landing , the Iron Throne was destroyed and the formerly hereditary monarchy was transformed into an elective one during the Great Council of 305 AC , with the lords and ladies of the Seven Kingdoms electing each new ruler, the first and incumbent elected monarch being King Bran the Broken . The monarch also takes the title of \"Lord of the Six Kingdoms\", with the North having been granted independence.

The king or queen simultaneously possesses the title Lord of the Seven Kingdoms , which refers to the seven independent kingdoms that existed prior to their unification in the Targaryen Conquest . As of the North \\'s independence after the ascension of Brandon I , the title is Lord of the Six Kingdoms . The ruler usually also holds the title and office of Protector of the Realm , the commander of the armies of the Seven Kingdoms (led by the four Wardens ). The office of \"Protector of the Realm\" is sometimes given to someone other than the current monarch, particularly during a regency when the ruler is under-aged, though if the current ruler does not possess great martial skill he may simply choose to delegate the office to someone else. Some rulers have combined the two aforementioned titles and have instead held the title Protector of the Seven Kingdoms . Known cases of this include Queen Cersei Lannister . The office of the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms is often referred to as the Iron Throne , in reference to the eponymous throne on which the King holds court. The position was created when Aegon the Conqueror succeeded in his conquest of Westeros , unifying the independent kingdoms of the Isles and Rivers , the Rock , the Reach , the Mountain and Vale , the Stormlands and the Kingdom of the North . The Principality of Dorne was later united to the realm through marriage-alliance. Upon her ascension to the Iron Throne, Queen Cersei Lannister was named the Protector of the Seven Kingdoms by Qyburn . This title combines the ranks of Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, and was created by Cersei.\" The Winds of Winter \" The king or queen is formally addressed by his or her subjects as \"Your Grace\" or \"Sire\" , and in official events referred to employing the following structure: \"Name\" of the House \"Name\" the \"ordinal number\" of His/Her Name, King/Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Lord/Lady of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm\" . For example, Robert Baratheon is formally referred to as \"Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of His name\" etc. If a king has not yet reached the legal age of majority , however, a regent will be named to rule until he comes of age. \"King of Westeros\" There is no such thing as the \"King of Westeros\", and this term does not officially exist within the Game of Thrones TV series. \" Westeros \" is the entire continent, stretching far north to the lands beyond the Wall , which are unmapped. The \" Six Kingdoms \" are the large unified realm which covers half of the continent of Westeros, bordering the Kingdom of the North at the Neck . After the Targaryen Conquest, the term \"Seven Kingdoms\" became a geographical term, referring to how Westeros south of the Wall used to be divided into seven independent kingdoms. On several occasions, dialogue in the TV series has referred to the King of the Andals and the First Men as the \"King of Westeros\", but this is not an official term in the novels. Stannis has been referred to as this a few times in the novels, but it is apparently a colloquialism, not the formal title. For that matter, the term \"King of the Seven Kingdoms\" doesn\\'t technically exist either: the proper title is \" King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms or King of the North\" List of monarchs of the Seven Kingdoms Targaryen dynasty (1–280 AC) Baratheon dynasty (280–303 AC) Robert I Baratheon (\"the Usurper\"), 280–298 AC Joffrey I Baratheon , 298–301 AC Tommen I Baratheon , 301–303 AC Lannister dynasty (303–305 AC) Cersei I Lannister , 303–305 AC Targaryen restoration (305 AC) Daenerys I Targaryen (\"Stormborn\", \"the Mother of Dragons\", \"the Dragon Queen\", \"the Breaker of Chains\"), 305 AC ( de facto ) Elected monarchs (305 AC–present) After the assassination of Daenerys Targaryen , the Great Council of 305 AC decides that the Six Kingdoms ( the North being allowed to secede) is to be transformed into an elective monarchy.

Although very few of the Targaryen kings are referenced in the TV series itself, all of their names, and their relative position in the sequence in relation to each other, has been established, either in props or in the Histories & Lore featurettes. Though generally assumed to follow the book series, the genealogy of all kings has not technically been established in the TV continuity. One major difference to the line of kings in the book series is the removal of Jaehaerys II Targaryen, who in the book series is the son and successor of Aegon V and the father and predecessor of Aerys II. The removal is intentional, possibly made to simplify the Targaryen family tree as Aemon relates his genealogical connection to the rest of the Targaryens to Jon Snow in Season 1. In Episode 3 of Season 4, \" Breaker of Chains \", Tywin Lannister relates the story of King \" Orys I \", who ruled for less than a year before being murdered by his brother. There is no Orys I in the books and though the context of Tywin\\'s story (he mentions three kings to Tommen, the other two, Baelor I and Robert I, were rulers of the Seven Kingdoms) suggests Orys was a Targaryen king, it is also possible that Orys was a local ruler in one of the kingdoms before the Targaryen conquest. In Episode 9 of Season 5, \" The Dance of Dragons \", Mace Tyrell tells Tycho Nestoris of the Iron Bank about King \" Maegor III \", who tried to outlaw usury in the Seven Kingdoms. As this Maegor III is specified to have ruled the Seven Kingdoms, his status as a Targaryen king is less open to interpretation and his regnal number also implies the existence of a \"Maegor II\". It is possible that \"Maegor III\" could be a mistake by Mace Tyrell (in-universe) or a mistake by the writers (out-of-universe). Though it would contradict the books, there is technically \"room\" for further kings in the sequence of rulers in the TV continuity. As stated, the relative order of the kings mentioned above is known and matches the books, but as opposed to the books, the regnal dates for most kings have not been mentioned. Though the relations of some are known (Aegon I is mentioned to be Aenys I\\'s and Maegor I\\'s father, Aegon IV is mentioned to be the son of Viserys II and the father of Daeron II, who in turn is mentioned to be the father of Aerys I and Maekar I, and the succession Maekar I - Aegon V - Aerys II is explicitly confirmed), for many it is currently left unclear whether their genealogy matches the books or not. For instance, Maegor I is mentioned as having been succeeded by his nephew in \" Maegor the Cruel \", in the books this is Jaehaerys I, but the name \"Jaehaerys I\" is only mentioned once explictly in the TV continuity, in \" The Rains of Castamere \", with no indication as to when he reigned or who he succeeded. Though they are known to have reigned in the same order relative to each other as in the books, the successions from Jaehaerys I to Viserys I, Aegon III to Daeron I, Daeron I to Baelor I, and Baelor I to Viserys II, and the genealogies of these kings relative to each other, are never explicitly confirmed in TV continuity material, meaning that the insertion of additional kings is possible while still maintaining internal consistency. In the books Dorne and the Rhoynar In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the full title used is actually \" King of the Andals and the Rhoynar, and the First Men \", Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm\". It\\'s probable that \"the Rhoynar \" was omitted in Season 1 for the sake of not confusing viewers who haven\\'t read the books with too much information, because Dorne and the Rhoynar wouldn\\'t be introduced until Season 4 . Corroborating this, very few references were made about Dorne at all before Season 4, compared to the earlier novels which referred to it and House Martell often - the TV series held off on giving this much long exposition, until Oberyn Martell was physically introduced on-screen in Season 4 (though on the other hand, Season 1 didn\\'t actually explain who \"the First Men \" or \"the Andals \" were in on-screen dialogue either, only in supplementary materials). When Season 4 did eventually air, however, the shortened title \"King of the Andals and the First Men\" continued to be used. Even during King Tommen Baratheon \\'s coronation scene in \" First of His Name \", with Prince Oberyn Martell standing prominently among the nobles assembled in front of the Iron Throne, Tommen is still crowned using only the shortened title \"King of the Andals and the First Men\" - excluding \"the Rhoynar\", even though as a Dornishman Oberyn is himself descended from the Rhoynar. However, in the season finale, Daenerys is presented using the full title. It would appear that the TV series initially chose to continue using the shortened title \"King of the Andals and the First Men\" because it is what they had been using for three seasons, and they wished to remain internally consistent (the other option was to suddenly start using the full title without explanation, introducing a rather large retcon that this is what they should have been saying all along). This isn\\'t necessarily an inexplicable situation within the TV-continuity itself: Dorne was actually independent from the Targaryen realm for two centuries, and when they entered united with the Iron Throne they were allowed special privileges (such as maintaining their own equal primogeniture system, and even styling their ruling family as \" Princes of Dorne \", not \" Lord Paramount of Dorne\". Thus it is possible that, in the TV continuity, the Targaryen kings simply never referred to themselves as Kings \"of the Rhoynar\" as well, even after the marriage-alliance (but still as \"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms\"), to acknowledge the fact that Dorne is still \"ruled\" by its own Princes, even if it is now subject to the Iron Throne (further acknowledging that Dorne is essentially a semi-autonomous region of the Seven Kingdoms). It might have been one of the conditions of the marriage-alliance in the TV continuity. As explained in the article for \" Lord of the Seven Kingdoms \", all of the Targaryen kings starting with Aegon I himself styled themselves as \"King of the Andals and the Rhoynar, and the First Men\" and \"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms\" - despite the fact that Dorne remained independent. Aegon I had declared himself king of all of Westeros just before his army even landed on the continent, Dorne included. While Dorne had been able to resist his armies and dragons through guerrilla warfare, Aegon himself never acknowledged that this was a permanent state of affairs. Aegon and all of his heirs considered themselves the de jure kings of the Rhoynar and of Dorne, even if they had no de facto control over it (comparable to how medieval English kings would at times hold titles of lordship over \"Wales\", \"Ireland\", and \"France\", despite not controlling all or even most of these territories). At no point (as readers sometimes have assumed) did Aegon ever \"promote\" the Riverlands into being considered the \"seventh\" kingdom (the Riverlands were occupied by the Iron Islands when he invaded and not an independent \"kingdom\", instead making up the \"eighth\" kingdom of sorts). Dorne was always the seventh of the \"Seven Kingdoms\", the Targaryens just refused to ever officially acknowledge that they did not actually control it - in the novels\\' continuity. In the TV continuity, therefore, the Targaryen kings may have just acknowledged for the first two centuries of their dynasty that they didn\\'t actually rule the Rhoynar people in Dorne, and that one of the special privileges of Dorne uniting with the Iron Throne through marriage-alliance one century ago is that the Targaryens didn\\'t suddenly add \"King of the Rhoynar\" to their title. One notable exception to this occurred, however, when the TV series was not internally consistent and used the original full title from the novels, including mention of \"the Rhoynar\" - in the Season 4 finale, \" The Children \", when Missandei introduces Daenerys Targaryen as \"Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar, and the First Men\". Moreover she was speaking in Low Valyrian at the time, so her lines were actually written in on-screen subtitles. This was not even consistent use for Missandei and Daenerys within Season 4 itself: earlier in episode 4.6 \" The Laws of Gods and Men \", Missandei introduced Daenerys as only \"Queen of the Andals and the First Men\" (again with on-screen subtitles, so this wasn\\'t just a mistake by the actress but in the script). In the middle of Season 4, as already noted, no mention was made of the Rhoynar in the title even at Tommen\\'s coronation in episode 4.5, when Oberyn Martell was standing in front of the audience. No official word has come down to make sense of this, but it appears to simply be a mistake by the scriptwriters, i.e. they accidentally wrote the full book-version of the title and forgot their own change to the continuity. This conclusion is reinforced by a comment George R.R. Martin himself made: This strongly implies that there was an actual sit-down meeting of the writers back in Season 1 when they formally established the principle that the title in the TV continuity was officially going to be shortened to just \"King of the Andals and the First Men\", and as a scriptwriter in Season 1 Martin was aware of this. The title was also consistently given as \"King of the Andals and the First Men\" throughout Season 5, omitting the Rhoynar. The single use of the full book version of the title in the Season 4 finale therefore simply appears to be a script error and not canonical. In the Season 6 premiere, however, Daenerys once again switched back to introducing herself as \"Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar , and the First Men\", without explanation.\" The Red Woman \" At this point it is again unclear what the title is \"officially\" supposed to be in the TV continuity. The TV writers could have retained the original version which omitted \"of the Rhoynar\", or they could have initiated a retcon by adding in \"of the Rhoynar\" from Season 4 onward: instead they inconsistently flip-flopped between the two forms. It is possible that the two terms are simply interchangeable. Ruling queens In the three hundred years between the Targaryen Conquest and the War of the Five Kings, there has never been a ruling queen: a female heir of the current monarch inheriting power in her own right. The first four Targaryen kings all had male heirs who were also their eldest child. However the fifth Targaryen king, Viserys I, only had one surviving child by his first wife before she died, a daughter named Rhaenyra Targaryen . With no other heirs, Viserys I and his court raised Rhaenyra with the expectation that she would be the first ruling queen. However, Viserys I remarried late in life, and had several sons with his second wife, the eldest of which was his son Aegon II. When Viserys I died this sparked a succession war between Rhaenyra and Aegon II, known as the Dance of Dragons, which raged from 129 to 131 AC (about 170 years before the War of the Five Kings). Aegon II ultimately had Rhaenyra fed alive to his dragon, but her supporters continued to fight in the name of her children, and not long afterwards Aegon II himself died childless. As the only remaining heir of Viserys I or Aegon II, Rhaenyra\\'s own son Aegon III inherited the throne (Aegon III\\'s own sons both died childless, and ultimately Rhaenyra\\'s younger son Viserys II succeeded to the throne). After the Dance of the Dragons , the Targaryens revised the official royal succession laws to follow an extreme form of male-preference primogeniture, placing female heirs behind all possible male ones, i.e. if all of a king\\'s sons died childless, his own younger brothers would inherit instead of his daughters (their nieces). Such was the case when after both of Aegon III\\'s sons died childless, his daughter Daena was skipped over in succession for Aegon III\\'s younger brother Viserys II. These altered inheritance laws ensured that there was no ruling queen in the history of the Seven Kingdoms. Many historians point to the succession of Rhaenyra\\'s son Aegon III after Aegon II died as proof of the legitimacy of Rhaenyra\\'s claim to inheritance in the civil war, and while she lived she did personally use the title of queen. Officially, however, Rhaenyra is considered a rival claimant and is not counted in the formal line of succession. Any possible future ruling queen by the name of \"Rhaenyra\" would be titled \"Rhaenyra I\", not \"Rhaenyra II\". As this would lead to controversy over whether to acknowledge Rhaenyra\\'s claim during the Dance of Dragons, subsequent generations of the Targaryen family simply avoided the issue by never naming any subsequent daughters \"Rhaenyra\". At the end of season 6, where King Tommen Baratheon commits suicide after the destruction of the Sept of Baelor, Cersei Lannister has proclaimed and crowned herself as Queen of the Andals and the First Men. Cersei considered herself the first true ruling queen in the history of the Seven Kingdoms. Although Cersei\\'s claim to the Iron Throne was not explored in detail, it may have derived from her being the widow of King Robert I and the mother of Joffrey I and Tommen I, effectively the heir to the Baratheon dynasty seeing as House Baratheon was extinct at the time of her coronation.', 'Kingdom of the North Location Northern Westeros Type Feudal absolute monarchy Population Less than 1,000,000 Culture Northmen Crannogmen Free Folk Andals Skagosi Northern Mountain clans Rulers House Stark Kings in the North Capital Winterfell Religion Old Gods of the Forest (majority) Faith of the Seven (minority) Military Individual armies controlled separately by noble Houses Institutions Night\\'s Watch Places of note The Barrowlands · The Bay of Ice · The Bay of Seals · Bear Island · The Bite · Blazewater Bay · The Broken Branch · Cape Kraken · The Gift · The Grey Cliffs · Ironman\\'s Bay · The Last River · Long Lake · The Neck · The Rills · Sea Dragon Point · Skagos · Skane · The Stony Shore · The Wall · The Weeping Water · The White Knife · The Wolfswood Date of founding Approx. 8,000 BC - 6,000 BC 298 AC , under Robb Stark (first refounding) 303 AC , under Jon Snow (second refounding) 305 AC , under Sansa Stark (third refounding) Formed from Various groups of the First Men in the lands of the North Date of dissolution 1 AC , pledged to Aegon Targaryen by Torrhen Stark 300 AC , brought under the Iron Throne by Roose Bolton (first refounding) 304 AC , pledged to Daenerys Targaryen by Jon Snow (second refounding) Founder { Bran the Builder } The Kingdom of the North is the name given to an independent realm that controls the northern territories of the continent of Westeros , north of the Six Kingdoms . It is named after the North , one of the nine distinct regions of Westeros and the largest and most prominent in the kingdom. The kingdom is ruled by the King or Queen in the North , typically the head of House Stark , from their seat at Winterfell . The kingdom was first founded by Brandon the Builder after the Long Night , but was conquered during the Targaryen conquest and made subservient to the Iron Throne . It was reestablished upon the proclamation of Robb Stark as the King in the North during the War of the Five Kings , but was again defeated by the Iron Throne. It was reestablished once more with the proclamation of Jon Snow , alleged bastard brother of Robb, as King in the North following the Battle of the Bastards . However, Jon eventually pledged himself to Daenerys Targaryen , thus returning the North back under the fold of the Seven Kingdoms under House Targaryen . It was reestablished finally by Sansa Stark after the assassination of Daenerys Targaryen and the selection of Brandon Stark as the new King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men in the Great Council of 305 AC .

After thousands of years of warfare, however, the First Men and the Children reached a peace, agreeing to the Pact at the Isle of Faces ; the First Men went on to adopt the Old Gods of the Forest worshiped by the Children. 2,000 years later, the Long Night descended upon the world , and the First Men and the Children of the Forest came together to push back the White Walkers in the War for the Dawn . Together, with the giants , they miraculously defeated the White Walkers, and raised the Wall to prevent the White Walkers from returning. While those trapped beyond the Wall became the Free Folk , those south of the Wall began to come together and form kingdoms. Brandon the Builder raised Winterfell and took it as his seat, becoming the first King of Winter and forging the Kingdom of the North, ruling all the lands north of the Neck . House Stark continued to descend from his line, reigning as the Kings of Winter and later Kings in the North after successfully unifying the lands of the North against rival kings . 2,000 years later, the Andals crossed the Narrow Sea from Andalos and invaded Westeros. Bringing with them chivalry and the Faith of the Seven , the Andals smashed all the kingdoms of the First Men with the exception of the Kingdom of the North, which they made peace with. Thus, the Northmen continues to hold to the culture of the First Men and the religion of the Old Gods while the rest adapted to Andal culture and the Faith of the Seven. During this time, the last of the Children of the Forest and the giants south of the Wall disappeared, the Andals believing them to be evil creatures. Over the centuries, they, like the White Walkers, have faded into legend. Conquest The First Men, the Andals, and the Rhoynar that lived in the Principality of Dorne , the southernmost kingdom in Westeros, faced a new common enemy, however: the last of the Dragonlords . The Valyrian Freehold was a massive empire that spanned nearly half of the known world , including the entirety of the continent of Essos across the Narrow Sea . The empire was forged with the Valyrians taming fire-breathing beasts called dragons . They defeated vast empires in Essos, such as the Ghiscari Empire , and the many city-states of the continent. They posed no threat to Westeros, however, until the migration of one Valyrian noble family to an eastern offshore island they called: the Targaryens . Naming it Dragonstone and raising a castle of the same name, the Targaryens narrowly escaped the Doom , an incredible and catastrophic event that destroyed Valyria , ravaged the Valyrian Peninsula , led to the ultimate collapse of the Valyrian Freehold, and killed all of the Valyrian noble families and their dragons, with the exception of the Targaryens. With Essos largely in ruins and being split into various, independent city-states during the Century of Blood , such as the Free Cities , Aegon Targaryen , the new head of the new House Targaryen , decided to instead look west for his inevitable conquest. Riding the last three dragons in the world with his sister-wives Visenya and Rhaenys , and with a relatively small army, Aegon landed at a point that started the city of King\\'s Landing and went on to conquer the seven independent kingdoms during the War of Conquest , including the Kingdom of the North when Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon. Remembered as Aegon the Conqueror, he unified the Seven Kingdoms into one realm subservient to the Iron Throne , established the Targaryen dynasty, and was named the King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men , Lord of the Seven Kingdoms , and Protector of the Realm . First refounding The Targaryen dynasty was ultimately overthrown nearly three centuries later during Robert\\'s Rebellion with the disposing and deaths of Aerys II , the Mad King, and his eldest son and heir, Prince Rhaegar . Lord Robert Baratheon , the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands and head of House Baratheon , became the new King of the Andals and the First Men and established the Baratheon dynasty . However, the death of King Robert I seventeen years later threw the already destabilizing realm into another great civil war: the War of the Five Kings . Among the five warring kings was Robb Stark , the Young Wolf, who was proclaimed the first King in the North in nearly three centuries by not only his bannermen in the North , but also by the lords of the Riverlands . The Riverlands were ruled by House Tully of Riverrun , who were connected by blood to King Robb through his mother, Catelyn Tully . The proclamation came about after Robert\\'s heir and alleged son, Joffrey Baratheon , wrongfully had Eddard Stark , Robb\\'s father, executed for treason after Eddard falsely confessed to save Sansa. Like the previous Hand of the King , Jon Arryn , Eddard Stark had discovered a shocking secret: Joffrey was in fact a bastard born of incest between Cersei Lannister , King Robert\\'s wife, and her twin brother Jaime Lannister . For this, House Lannister backed King Joffrey I and functionally controlled the Iron Throne for many years. Tywin Lannister , the Lord Paramount of the Westerlands and head of House Lannister, had also led the invasion of the Riverlands when Catelyn Stark had Tyrion Lannister arrested and brought to the Eyrie to stand trial with her sister, Lysa Arryn . The Northmen had come to the aid of the Rivermen when they learned of Eddard Stark\\'s arrest and due to their intertwined bloodlines through marital alliances. Though the resurgent Kingdom of the North was winning many of its battles, one of its vassals, House Frey of the Twins , turned against their liege lords when Robb married Talisa Maegyr after falling in love with her, breaking his vow to House Frey to marry one of Walder Frey \\'s daughters. Walder Frey secretly colluded with Tywin Lannister and Roose Bolton to betray the Starks and Tullys. When Robb came to Frey to make amends, Frey feigned forgiveness and agreed to a marriage between Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey . However, this was a trap designed to lure the Starks into an ambush known as the Red Wedding , in which House Frey and House Bolton slaughtered them. Arranged in secret by Tywin Lannister, Tywin oversaw that Roose Bolton was named the new Lord Paramount of the North and granted Winterfell while Walder Frey was named the new Lord Paramount of the Riverlands and granted Riverrun. Roose was also married to one of Walder\\'s daughters, Walda Frey . Second refounding House Bolton , which had fought against the Starks in ancient times as the Red Kings , unsteadily held the North as many of the Northern Houses opposed their rule. Eventually, conflict broke out within House Bolton itself after Walda Bolton gave birth to a trueborn son . Roose \\'s bastard son Ramsay had been legitimized by King Tommen I , but the line of succession would now be contested as he was not trueborn. Because of this, Ramsay assassinated his father and murdered Roose Bolton\\'s family, seizing power in the North for himself. Though Ramsay had the allegiance of House Karstark and an alliance with House Umber , his rule was contested by his runaway wife, Sansa Stark , the sister of Robb. Roose had previously arranged the marriage of Sansa to Ramsay with Petyr Baelish to legitimize Bolton rule over the North. Sansa, along with her resurrected half-brother Jon Snow , who was said to be the bastard son of Eddard Stark, raised a host of Stark loyalists under the banners of House Mormont , House Hornwood , and House Mazin . Jon also had the backing of the Free Folk , with whom he had formed an alliance with and allowed to cross the Wall to escape the Night King during his tenure as Lord Commander of the Night\\'s Watch . Jon led the combined Stark-wildling host at the Battle of the Bastards , which the other Northern Houses sat out of, fearing the Boltons and not wanting to risk their men to a lost cause despite their loyalty to the Starks. Though Jon\\'s army was narrowly smashed by Ramsay\\'s army, Sansa arrived at the battlefield with the knights of the Vale , led by House Arryn , the rulers of the Vale from the Eyrie . Ramsay was executed, and Sansa became the Lady of Winterfell while Jon Snow, named the White Wolf, was declared the King in the North by the gathered lords of the North and the Vale at Winterfell. Jon Snow was primarily concerned with the mysterious return of the White Walkers north of the Wall , which most of Westeros scoffed at, believing the White Walkers to be nothing more than fairy tales. Though his bannermen believed him, Jon\\'s decision to negotiate with Daenerys Targaryen , who had begun her war for Westeros to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister , was unpopular as many remembered the tyranny of her father, the Mad King , whom they had fought and overthrown. Nonetheless, Daenerys controlled the mines of dragonglass at Dragonstone , which could be used to kill White Walkers and stop wights , as well as three fire breathing dragons that could also stop wights. Jon departed to White Harbor to sail to Dragonstone with Ser Davos Seaworth and a company of guards , leaving his half-sister Sansa in charge of the North as Lady Regent . Though initially sharing a tense relationship , Jon and Daenerys grew to trust each other, with Daenerys allowing Jon to mine the dragonglass and coming to have more faith in him over his concern with the White Walkers. Per a proposal put forward by Tyrion Lannister , the Hand to Daenerys, Jon led an expedition beyond the Wall to capture a wight to use as proof at an upcoming parley in King\\'s Landing . Jon and his fellowship succeeded in subduing a wight , though faced heavy losses: several wildling warriors, Thoros of Myr , and Benjen Stark all fell, as well as one of Daenerys\\'s dragons, Viserion , at the hands of the Night King after Daenerys flew to the far north to rescue Jon and his group. For this, Jon pledged himself to Daenerys on a ship to the capital and they eventually fall in love. Once reaching the capital for the Dragonpit Summit , Jon, Daenerys, and their followers met with Cersei Lannister and her retinue at the Dragonpit , where Jon publicly declared that he had pledged himself to Daenerys Targaryen already after Cersei agreed to a truce and in exchange asked for Jon to remain neutral after the Great War . Though negotiations broke down, Tyrion was able to repair the truce, and Cersei pledged her forces to the northern cause (though secretly planned to hold back her armies and let her enemies slaughter each other). Jon, who was appointed Warden of the North by Daenerys, then had a raven sent to Winterfell informing Sansa of this. Third refounding After Daenerys Targaryen\\'s war , which culminated in her laying waste to the surrendered populace of King\\'s Landing, Jon reluctantly assassinated her to stop her plans for further destruction. Weeks later, a great council decided to exile Jon as a compromise between the Unsullied, who insisted on Jon\\'s execution, and the North, who wanted him freed. Sansa decided to separate the North from the Seven Kingdoms . This was permitted by the new King Bran Stark during his election by all the lords of the Seven Kingdoms but Sansa abstained, opting to vouch for the North\\'s independence. Sansa is subsequently crowned the Queen in the North by a gathering of Northern lords and soldiers at Winterfell. Government The Kingdom of the North is an absolute monarchy intertwined with a system of feudalism. The monarch is referred to as the King in the North , who rules the kingdom from the castle of Winterfell , the capital. Like their counterparts across Westeros , the Kingdom of the North utilizes feudalism to keep control and order. Lands are ruled by noble Houses , who owe their fealty to the King in the North, typically the head of House Stark . In turn, these noble Houses may have lesser vassals of their own, ruling over their own sections of land. Unlike their southern counterparts, chivalry is not deeply ingrained in the culture of the North , so knightly Houses are a rare find in the kingdom. At the bottom of the social ladder are the smallfolk , or the commoners, who make up the majority of the population of the kingdom. The King in the North bears no formal titles on their advisors, though the king can indeed host a council and heed the advice of any appointed advisors.

Ruled by Robin Arryn independently since 305 AC, after he came of age and elected Bran Stark as their new king . The Riverlands House Tully Riverrun 298 AC The lords of Riverlands swore fealty to Robb Stark as the King in the North . The rebellious riverlords were finally subdued by Lannister - Frey forces in 303 AC. Edmure Tully chose to remain in the realm in 305 AC, electing Bran as their new king. Territories The Kingdom of the North is named after the North , one of the nine distinct regions of the continent of Westeros and by far the largest of the nine. As suggested by its name, the North constitutes the northernmost lands of Westeros south of the Wall ; the lands beyond the Wall are not apart of any kingdom. Historically, the Kingdom of the North was only made up of the region known as the North itself, though the borders of the North were loosely defined; hence why the King in the North was not called the \"King of the North.\" This was most noticeably seen during the War of the Five Kings , where the region that borders the North to its south, the Riverlands , declared for House Stark and was annexed into the reestablished Kingdom of the North. House Tully of Riverrun continued to rule the Riverlands on behalf of Robb Stark . They were no longer subservient to the Iron Throne , but instead to Winterfell . The Tullys were tied by blood to House Stark through the marriage of Catelyn Tully to Eddard Stark ; King Robb was their eldest son. After the Red Wedding , while the North fell to the rule of House Bolton of the Dreadfort , the Riverlands fell to the rule of House Frey of the Twins , both Houses ruling on behalf of the Iron Throne. This took precedence once more in the \"aftermath conflicts\" of the War of the Five Kings at the Battle of the Bastards . The resurgent Stark army, made up of loyalists as well as the surviving Free Folk who traditionally lived beyond the Wall, was aided by a cavalry force of House Arryn , the rulers of the Vale , which borders the North on its southeastern border. After the battle which saw the defeat and extinction of House Bolton, both the lords of the North and the lords of the Vale declared Jon Snow , bastard brother of King Robb, their King in the North. The Vale and the North had been strong allies for many years, partially thanks to the friendship shared between Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark, who together, alongside Robert Baratheon and Hoster Tully , overthrew the Targaryen dynasty during the War of the Usurper . Robin Arryn became the new lord of the Vale at an unknown point of time and participated in the election of the new king after the assassination of Daenerys Targaryen . The North was allowed to secede under Lady Sansa Stark . Military Being dominated by the social system known as feudalism, the Kingdom of the North has no permanent, united army that stands behind the King in the North . Rather, individual armies are controlled separately by the noble Houses of the North. Despite this, there is a clear chain of command: the King in the North can rally his banners, and in turn, the lords of noble Houses can rally the banners of their vassals. Each lord maintains a permanent group of elite knights , warriors, and other guards. Furthermore, the smallfolk , or commoners, of the lands can be conscripted into the Northern armies through feudal levies. Culture The modern Northmen continue to practice much of the culture of the First Men and uphold their values, as the Kingdom of the North was the only kingdom not to fall to the Andal invaders . As such, their culture, much like that of the ironborn and the Dornishmen , is very distinct from the rest of Westeros . Chivalry is practiced little in the North, with few warriors having been formally anointed as knights. Northern warriors hold onto their own ideas of honor and virtue separate from the knighthood brought over by the Andals. A common belief expressed by Eddard Stark is that \"the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,\" referring to how Northern lords execute prisoners on their own, and do not rely on a headsman to deliver their justice. Northern warriors are, in general, much more brutish and fearsome than their southern counterparts. Because of their isolation from the southern kingdoms in large part due to the immense size of the North, the Northerners are very loyal to their own, something that Jon Snow states is in fact similar to the Free Folk , who only follow various chieftains of their own and occasionally their own King-Beyond-the-Wall . The Northmen continue to hold onto the traditions of their Old Way . Major religions Because the First Men held the Kingdom of the North against the Andal invaders , the descending Northmen continued to hold onto their ancestors\\' culture and religion, worshiping the Old Gods of the Forest that the First Men were said to have adopted from the Children of the Forest thousands of years ago. Nonetheless, intermingling with the Andals in the southern kingdoms also brought over the influence of the Faith of the Seven to the North. The Old Gods of the Forest The old nature gods worshiped by the Children of the Forest and later the First Men. Still worshiped by the people of the North and a few isolated others, particularly ancient noble Houses, in the south of Westeros. The old gods are numerous and nameless. Prayers and offerings are made to the old gods in front of heart trees ; great weirwood trees with faces carved into the bark. Its followers believe that the Old Gods can see through the heart trees, which caused the Andals to cut down most heart trees in southern Westeros. The faith of the Old Gods of the Forest is the dominant religion worshiped by the majority in the Kingdom of the North. The Faith of the Seven The Faith of the Seven was brought to Westeros by the Andals. The Faith contends there is one god consisting of seven separate aspects : the Mother, the Father, the Warrior, the Smith, the Maiden, the Crone, and the Stranger. People worship the Seven in seven-sided churches called septs and are led in worship by priests and priestesses known as \"septons\" and \"septas\". The Faith is not only a belief system but also an institution led by the High Septon from the Great Sept of Baelor in King\\'s Landing. The Faith has traditionally not been very tolerant of other religions but this was relaxed somewhat after centuries of coexistence with the remaining followers of the Old Gods and the Drowned God. When the Rhoynar migrated to Dorne a thousand years ago they converted to the Faith of the Seven, but often simply ignored rules they didn\\'t like. The modern Dornishmen have somewhat relaxed sexual mores, attaching no stigma to bastard children, homosexuality, or formal mistresses . While they follow some of the rules of the Faith of the Seven more loosely, however, the Dornishmen are no less devout. The Faith of the Seven is worshiped by a minority in the Kingdom of the North. The annexation of the Riverlands under Robb Stark and later the Vale under Jon Snow has officially made the religion more widespread in the kingdom, however, though not much more so in the North itself. With the Riverlands and Vale no longer part of the Kingdom of the North, the Faith of the Seven has become more limited. Worshipers of the Seven in the North include Houses Manderly and Whitehill , as well as most of the population of White Harbor .'],\n",
      "    response=\"Hey, that's a great follow-up question! In Game of Thrones, the Seven Kingdoms refer to the seven major regions of Westeros that were originally independent before being unified under one ruler. They were conquered and brought together by Aegon Targaryen about 300 years before the events of the series, forming the foundation of the Iron Throne's realm. Here's a quick breakdown to tie it into what we've talked about before:\\n\\n- **Historical Formation**: These kingdoms started as separate entities ruled by ancient houses, formed after the First Men settled Westeros and fought off threats like the White Walkers. The Andals invaded later, adding more layers to their culture, but it was Aegon the Conqueror who used his dragons to unite them into one realm, except for Dorne, which joined later through marriage.\\n\\n- **Rulers and Structure**: Each kingdom had its own ruling house, like the Starks in the North or the Lannisters in the Westerlands. After unification, the King or Queen on the Iron Throne (like Robert Baratheon or Cersei Lannister) ruled over all, but with local lords managing their regions. This setup is key to conflicts like the War of the Five Kings, which you asked about earlier—it's basically a massive civil war over who gets to control these kingdoms.\\n\\n- **Significance in the Story**: The Seven Kingdoms (now often called the Six Kingdoms after the North gained independence) drive a lot of the drama, showing themes of power, loyalty, and betrayal. It connects to things like the Red Wedding and the characters we've discussed, as the struggle for these lands shapes the entire narrative.\\n\\nIf you're curious about a specific kingdom, like the North or Dorne, or how this ties into the Five Kings, just let me know—I'm here to dive deeper and keep the conversation going!\"\n",

Hamilton was born on April 14, 1788 When James was sixteen, his father was killed in a duel with Vice President Aaron Burr . Along with his mother and siblings , James was present in the room, sitting at his father\\'s bedside, when he died a few hours after the duel . Hamilton served as acting Secretary of State to President Andrew Jackson and sided with Jackson in opposing the Second Bank of the United States, the successor to the bank which had originally been invented by his father His father\\'s life and career, friends and rivals, are discussed at length in Hamilton\\'s memoirs, Reminiscences of James A.

The musical has made incredible box-office success in its Broadway production in the Richard Rodgers Theater as well as its Off-Broadway debut at The Public Theater in Manhattan. Contents 1 Background 1.1 Lincoln Center Performance 2 Songs 3 Plot summary 3.1 Act One 3.2 Act Two Background Production and lyrics of the musical began when Lin-Manuel Miranda discovered the biography Alexander Hamilton , by Ron Chernow, in an airport while on vacation from his other Broadway hit In The Heights (off-Broadway 2005-2007). While reading it on vacation in Mexico, Miranda began developing early ideas of a musical revolving Hamilton and his life. He began writing these ideas down, frequently shouting out ideas to his wife, Vanessa Nadal, as they came to mind. After researching, he found that a play by the life of Alexander Hamilton did exist, though it dated back to 1917. The first idea of Hamilton was brought up while Lin was at the bar with Jeremy McCarter. McCarter says \"...Lin-Manuel Miranda told me he wanted to write a hip-hop concept album about the life of Alexander Hamilton. For a second I thought we sharing a drunken joke. We were probably drunk, but he wasn\\'t joking.\" Adapted from the biography, Miranda began to draft lyrics and music in his spare time from In The Heights , and created the production The Hamilton Mixtape , brought to life by the Vassar Workshop (with Alex Lacamoire on the piano). The workshop earned a showcase at New York Stage and Film and gained very positive reviews from famous Broadway personalities. Miranda was later invited to the White House\\'s Evening of Poetry, Music, and the Spoken Word , and, though he was set to perform music from In The Heights , he instead performed the opening number from The Hamilton Mixtape , the to-be version of the first song from the musical titled Alexander Hamilton . Lincoln Center Performance A few years after the idea came about, after a few of the songs had been written, Lincoln Center asked him to put on an American Songbook Concert. Tommy Kail suggested they get a band and orchestrate some of the songs to perform at Lincoln Center. \"Lin opened the program with a set of songs he called \\'the DNA of my brain.\\' These were [some of the] hits from some of his favorite rappers:.....Then he and his friends performed all of the Hamilton songs that [Lin] had produced so far.\" (Hamilton: The Revolution, Page 46, Paragraph 3) With increasingly positive comments on the snippet of The Hamilton Mixtape Miranda performed at the White House in the 2009 annual Poetry Jam, and then performed the workshop production of it at the Vassar Reading Festival, which was directed by Thomas Kail , with Alex Lacamoire playing the music. From there it reached its Off-Broadway production in The Public Theater, with an entirely different company (excluding Daveed Diggs as Thomas Jefferson / Marquis de Lafayette and Christopher Jackson as George Washington) and after its debut would perform live on Broadway. Its schedule to perform from July to September 2018 was: July 9-September 1, 2018: Tuesday @7pm, Wednesday @2pm and 8pm, Thursday @7pm, Friday @8pm, Saturday @2pm and 8pm, and Sunday @3pm .

By use of his intelligence and \"top-notch brain\", Alexander travels to New York, in the developing nation of America, in hopes for a better life (\" Alexander Hamilton \"). Upon arrival in the summer of 1776, he immediately seeks out the young upstart Aaron Burr for advice, who in turn tells him to \"talk less, smile more\" (\" Aaron Burr, Sir \"). Alexander instead joins up with three revolutionaries: John Laurens , Marquis de Lafayette , and Hercules Mulligan , and gains their friendship and trust in the Revolution by impressing them with his knowledge and skill (\" My Shot \"), and the four sing about earning their country by staking their lives for the cause ( The Story of Tonight \"). As news of the Revolution spreads and grows in excitement, the Schuyler sisters Angelica , Elizabeth , and Peggy Schuyler sing about their hopes and prospects of the Revolution. (\" The Schuyler Sisters \") The opposing Loyalist Samuel Seabury arrives and proclaims against the Revolution, while Hamilton defends the movement by opposing the Loyalist\\'s actions (\" Farmer Refuted \"). A message then arrives from the king of England, King George III , explaining that the king will fight for the colonist\\'s loyalty back (\" You\\'ll Be Back \"). Despite this, Hamilton and his newfound allies go further to join the Continental Army, in which Hamilton is given and accepts a position as George Washington \\'s right-hand man (\" Right Hand Man \"). In the winter ball hosted by Philip Schuyler in 1780, the men are in attendance, and they set their sights on the three Schuyler sisters (\" A Winter\\'s Ball \"). Elizabeth Schuyler , the middle Schuyler sister, immediately fancies Alexander, and after they are introduced by her sister Angelica Schuyler, they are married by the blessing of Eliza\\'s father (\" \"). Angelica, however, still has feelings for Alexander, but keeps them aside for the sake of her sister (\" Satisfied \"). Aaron Burr then meets up with Hamilton, Marquis de Lafayette, John Laurens, and Hercules Mulligan, and privately admits to Hamilton that he is having an affair with the wife of a British officer. Hamilton tells him to go for her (\" The Story of Tonight (Reprise) \"). However, Burr explains that he will wait for what life has in store for him, like how he has waited for everything else in his past (\" Wait For It \"). As the Revolution is underway, Hamilton continually asks Washington for a promotion and for a command, to which Washington denies. George Washington instead promotes Charles Lee , which leads up to an incredibly disastrous battle, in which Lee is demoted to Marquis de Lafayette. Lee then proceeds to ridicule Washington in public, which prompts Hamilton into taking action, which Washington forbids as it is increasingly likely to lead to a duel. Instead, Hamilton\\'s close friend and Washington\\'s aide-de-camp, John Laurens, offers to duel Lee for him so he will not go against Washington (\" Stay Alive \"). Laurens wins the duel against Lee (\" Ten Duel Commandments \") but Washington comes to know about the duel and is outraged at Hamilton, consequentially sending him home to be with his wife Eliza (\" Meet Me Inside \"). Eliza tells Alexander that she is pregnant with his child, and although at first Hamilton is unsure of himself, Eliza assures him that he is everything to her and begs him to stay home (\" That Would Be Enough \"). As Marquis de Lafayette takes an increasingly powerful role in the development of the Revolution, he convinces France to aid the Continental Army, in which event shifts the balance to the Americans. However, he and Washington know that to win the battle they will need the help of Hamilton, and so Washington reluctantly calls Hamilton back to the army and gives him the command he has requested for so long (\" Guns And Ships \"). The night before the battle, Washington calls Hamilton aside and explains to him that no matter how big an impact someone has on the course of history, they cannot control how they are remembered in someone else\\'s eyes (\" History Has Its Eyes On You \"). The Continental Army wins the battle after a British soldier surrenders to them (\" Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down) \"). After their victory, King George III questions the colonists how they will set up government and tend their own nation and rule on their own without losing the people\\'s trust (\" What Comes Next? \"). After the success in the Revolution, Hamilton returns home to his son Philip Hamilton , while Burr\\'s daughter Theodosia is born; the two sing of their hopes and fears for the future (\" Dear Theodosia \"). After learning the shocking news of the death of John Laurens (\" Tomorrow There\\'ll Be More Of Us \"), Hamilton and Burr together travel to New York to complete their studies and return as lawyers. Due to his success, Hamilton is enlisted to a delegate of the Constitutional Convention in 1787 . Hamilton privately requests Burr to write The Federalist Papers in defense of the new U.S. Constitution; however, after Burr\\'s unmoving denial, Hamilton turned to James Madison and John Jay to write the papers. After Washington is elected in the Election of 1788, he gives Hamilton the opportunity to be the Secretary of the Treasury, and although Eliza pleads him not to accept the offer, Hamilton realizes how big of an opportunity it was and agrees (\" Non-Stop \"). Act Two Taking place in 1789, Thomas Jefferson returns home in America from his time off in France, at which point James Madison refers to Jefferson in an attempt to stop Hamilton\\'s financial plan, which in his belief would grant the government excessive power over the people (\" What\\'d I Miss? \"). Jefferson hears his request and debates with Hamilton over his plan in a heated manner; George Washington privately tells Hamilton that he must find a way to convince Congress of his plan in favor of both parties (\" Cabinet Battle #1 \"). Hamilton returns home to work, at which time Eliza reminds him that his son has turned nine years old. At dinner, his son Philip Hamilton performs a rap he composed, which impresses his father and convinces him of his son\\'s literary skill. Angelica tells Hamilton that his best chances would be in convincing Jefferson, his main political enemy, that his financial plan had benefited so that Congress would accept as well . She and Eliza then try to persuade Hamilton to accompany them on a trip upstate to their father\\'s house; however, Hamilton declines, saying he was caught up in work for his plan for Congress (\" Take A Break \"). While not in the company of family, Hamilton is approached by Maria Reynolds , who tells him her husband James Reynolds is mistreating her and is unfaithful. Hamilton decides to aid Maria and eventually began an affair. The scandal slips to her husband, who in turn confronts Hamilton and says he will keep the affair a secret if Hamilton agrees to pay him a sum. Hamilton, though scared for his political reputation, accepts the blackmail and continues the affair (\" Say No To This \"). Hamilton goes to Jefferson and Madison and they discuss his financial plan. He, Madison, and Jefferson come to a compromise: the plan would be put to action if the nation\\'s capital were to be moved from New York to a site closer to Jefferson\\'s home in Virginia, Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, Aaron Burr is envious of the amount of power Hamilton holds over the government and its decisions, wishing he could be of that position (\" The Room Where It Happens \"). He switches his political party and overthrows Hamilton\\'s father-in-law, Philip Schuyler\\'s seat in the Senate, and is granted more political power as a result. Because he is now against the Schuylers, Burr creates a divide between him and Hamilton (\" Schuyler Defeated \"). In the second cabinet battle, Jefferson and Hamilton dispute over whether the United States should aid the French in the French Revolution (War of the First Coalition) . Washington sides with Hamilton, deciding to stay neutral (\" Cabinet Battle #2 \"). After the argument, Burr, Madison, and Jefferson recollect on how image-worthy it must feel to have Washington on his side always and discuss a plan to ruin Hamilton\\'s political reputation (\" Washington On Your Side \"). Washington talks with Hamilton and privately announces that he is stepping down from the government. Hamilton retorts that Washington would never be defeated in the campaign for the presidency; Washington replies that he has stepped down from running for president as well. Hamilton is shocked but is convinced by him that it is in the best interests of the nation. The men write a farewell address (\" One Last Time \"). King George III, in turn, is jubilant upon receiving news that Washington has stepped down, certain that the rebel nation would fall apart under the leadership of John Adams (\" I Know Him \"). The Federalist Party is brought down by a dispute between Hamilton and John Adams (\" The Adams Administration \"). Madison, Jefferson, and Burr think they have found a scandal capable of ruining Hamilton\\'s image and charge him with committing treason and pilfering money from the government; however, in truth, they had discovered the transactions of Hamilton\\'s payments catering James Reynolds\\' blackmail in order to keep his affair with Maria Reynolds secret. Hamilton, knowing the lie spun to dismantle his career was worse than the truth, begs the men not to publicize the scandal and informs them of his affair (\" We Know \"). Hamilton remembers that being truthful has saved him many times in the past and decides that it is the only way out of his situation (\" Hurricane \"). Hamilton then publishes his affair to the public in his creation of the Reynolds Pamphlet (\" The Reynolds Pamphlet \"). When Eliza comes to know of the affair through the publication, she mournfully vows to never look back on everything they had, and \"erases herself from the narrative\", claiming that in the course of history no one would know her reaction to Hamilton\\'s actions (\" Burn \"). Years pass after the course events, and their son Philip turns nineteen and graduates from Kings College. He hears about George Eacker publicly degrading Hamilton\\'s reputation and immediately challenges him to a duel. He then asks his father for guidance. Hamilton lends him his pistols and tells him to be safe. Philip counts to ten as his mother taught him, but Eacker shoots him at the count of seven (\" Blow Us All Away \"). Philip is taken to the doctor, and passes away, Hamilton and Eliza by his deathbed (\" Stay Alive (Reprise) \"). After Philip\\'s death, the Hamiltons move uptown, where it is calmer and more serene, and Hamilton requests Eliza\\'s forgiveness for everything he has done, to which Eliza accepts (\" It\\'s Quiet Uptown \"). It is 1800, and president John Adams is defeated in the campaign, after which Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr are matched in a tie. The public then asks for whom Hamilton supports, as he has the public\\'s trust and will unbalance the tie. Hamilton replies that though he has never supported Jefferson once, he would now because Burr had switched his loyalties again for personal reputation (\" The Election of 1800 \"). After Jefferson\\'s election, Burr is outraged and commences Hamilton to a duel for what he has done (\" Your Obedient Servant \"). On the morning of the duel, before Hamilton\\'s departure, Eliza calls him back to bed. Hamilton replies gently that he has to leave, and calls her lovingly the \"best of wives and best of women\" (\" Best of Wives and Best of Women \"). Hamilton travels to Weehawken, New Jersey with trusted seconds , close to where his son Philip died in his duel with George Eaker. Hamilton willingly \"throws away his shot\" , but Burr thinks this is unwilling and shoots him, fatally wounding him. He later realizes that even though in terms of the duel he won, he would only be remembered through the course of history as the villain who killed Alexander Hamilton (\" The World Was Wide Enough \"). The company then proceeds to end the musical, and Eliza sings about \"putting herself back in the narrative\" and continuing to remember Alexander\\'s legacy and tells the story of the soldiers who fought by his side. Eliza collects funds for the Washington Monument and raises awareness against slavery. After Alexander\\'s time, Eliza found the first private orphanage in New York City and helps with the raising of hundreds of children. As she passes, she is shown that her legacy will be protected and passed on as she did for the legacy of Alexander Hamilton (\" Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story \").', 'Alexander Hamilton Biographical information Also known as Tom-Cat, Mr. Secretary, Son, Alexander Hamilton Sr. Born January 11, 1755 or 1757 Charlestown, Nevis, British West Indies Died July 12, 1804 (aged 47 or 49) New York City, New York, U.S. Gender Male Occupation Secretary of the Treasury Political party Federalist Family Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton (wife) Angelica Schuyler (sister-in-law) Peggy Schuyler (sister-in-law) Cornelia Schuyler (sister-in-law) Catherine Schuyler (sister-in-law) Philip Jeremiah Schuyler (brother-in-law) John Bradstreet Schuyler (brother-in-law) Rensselaer Schuyler (brother-in-law) Philip Hamilton (son) Philip Schuyler (father-in-law) Angelica Hamilton (daughter) James Alexander Hamilton (son) Alexander Hamilton, Jr. (son) William Hamilton (son) Philip Hamilton II (son) John Church Hamilton (son) Eliza Hamilton Holly (daughter) James Hamilton, Jr. (never mentioned) (brother) James Hamilton, Sr. (father) Rachel Faucette Lavien (mother) Behind the scenes First appearance \" Alexander Hamilton \" Portrayed by Vassar Workshop Lin-Manuel Miranda Off-Broadway Lin-Manuel Miranda Org.

Contents 1 Biography 1.1 Act One 1.2 Act Two 2 Casting Changes 2.1 Vassar Workshop 4 Trivia Biography Act One Alexander Hamilton was born in the West Indies region of the Caribbean. According to the musical, Hamilton\\'s father left him and his mother, who died from a fever when he was 12. He then moved in with a cousin who committed suicide, which left him to fend for himself as he had no one else. When he became older, a hurricane destroyed his town. In others\\' time of need, and due to his exceedingly brilliant intelligence, the citizens of the town collected funds so that Hamilton could book passage on a New York-bound ship (\" Alexander Hamilton \"). When Hamilton arrived in New York he became interested in the up-and-coming American revolution. There he first meets Aaron Burr in New York City (\" Aaron Burr, Sir \") and is then introduced to the rest of Burr\\'s revolutionary friends and impresses them with his oratory skills (\" My Shot \"). He has long dreamed of laying down his life for a cause such as the revolution (\" The Story of Tonight \") and studied furiously before joining the Revolution, and becoming George Washington\\'s secretary during the war. (\" Right Hand Man \"). Hamilton then attends a winter ball (\" A Winter\\'s Ball \"), where he meets Elizabeth Schuyler. They talk to each other through letters for two weeks and eventually marry (\" \"). Her sister also had feelings for him, but Angelica allows Eliza to marry Hamilton, because she \\'loves her sister more than anything in this life\\'. (\" Satisfied \"). General George Washington sends Hamilton home during the war for disobeying direct orders and engaging in a duel with General Charles Lee (\" Meet Me Inside \"). However, soon after he was summoned back, (\" Guns And Ships \") to finish the war at the Battle of Yorktown. (\" Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down) \"). After the war, Eliza gives birth to a baby boy named Philip Hamilton , whose innocent brilliance leaves him astounded (\" Dear Theodosia \"). Hamilton returns to New York to finish his studies and pursue a law career. Hamilton is then chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. Hamilton enlists James Madison and John Jay to write The Federalist Papers after Aaron Burr refuses. The newly elected President Washington enlists Hamilton for the job of Secretary of Treasury, despite Eliza\\'s pleas. (\" Non-Stop \"). Act Two After Thomas Jefferson returns from France in 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate over the merits of Hamilton\\'s financial plan during a Cabinet meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress. (\" Cabinet Battle #1 \"). Hamilton\\'s son turns nine, and he corresponds with Angelica in England, where she advises him to sway Jefferson so that Congress accepts his plan. Angelica travels back to New York to go upstate with his family but he refuses insisting he has to work. (\" Take A Break \"). While alone, Maria Reynolds visits Hamilton, who seduces him by claiming that her husband mistreats her. They continue to have an affair for a month until Maria\\'s husband James Reynolds blackmails Hamilton into paying him money. In return, Reynolds will not tell Eliza about the affair. Hamilton agrees to pay Reynolds and continues the affair. (\" Say No To This \"). Hamilton discusses his plan with Jefferson and Madison over a private dinner, which results in the Compromise of 1790, giving support to Hamilton\\'s financial plan in exchange for moving the United States capital from New York to Washington, D.C., a site that is much closer to Jefferson\\'s home in Virginia (\" The Room Where It Happens \"). In another cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in their revolution. Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton\\'s argument of neutrality (\" Cabinet Battle #2 \"). As Washington steps down from his presidential position, Hamilton drafts his farewell address. (\" One Last Time \"). Now having no political office since the election of John Adams, Hamilton is outraged by Adams\\'s \"unprepared\" nature according to Hamilton. They get in a fight with Adams bashing Hamilton for being an orphan; Hamilton\\'s response being very harsh to Adams\\'s weight. Hamilton\\'s reputation takes a blow from this, and his political enemies, Burr, Jefferson, and Madison, think that it is the perfect time to destroy him (\" The Adams Administration \"). Thinking they have discovered a scandal capable of destroying Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and Burr accuse him of embezzling government money and committing treason. In reality, however, they found the transactions from his affair with Maria Reynolds. Hamilton, knowing that the truth is the only way out, tells them about his affair and begs them not to tell anyone (\" We Know \"). Still worried that they would, Hamilton thinks about how writing openly and honestly has saved him in the past (\" Hurricane \"), and publicly writes \"The Reynolds Pamphlet\" to come clean about the affair, hoping to save his political legacy (\" The Reynolds Pamphlet \"). After his eldest child, Philip Hamilton , challenges George Eacker to a duel , he is mortally wounded and dies from infection (\" Blow Us All Away \"). Hamilton and Eliza become increasingly depressed after their loss and they move uptown (\" It\\'s Quiet Uptown \"). As the Election of 1800 approaches, Alexander Hamilton is frequently asked about who he will promote for president. Shockingly, Hamilton selects Jefferson, claiming that Burr has no beliefs and stands for himself. (\" The Election of 1800 \"). Burr, angry at his absent endorsement, challenges Hamilton to a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey (\" Your Obedient Servant \"). As a gunshot sounds, Hamilton soliloquizes on death, his relationships, and his legacy. He aims his pistol at the sky and is struck by Burr\\'s shot, dying soon after. Burr laments that even though he survived, he\\'s cursed to be the villain in history, remembered only as the man who killed Alexander Hamilton (\" The World Was Wide Enough \"). He now lies in Trinity Church, right near Angelica after she passed away.

First, I am considering the conversation history, which shows the user is engaging in a casual, exploratory dialogue about Supernanny, asking about Jo Frost\\'s identity, her personality, and now my potential fandom. This indicates a building rapport and a desire for a fun, interactive exchange rather than deep factual analysis. Second, I am examining the current question, \"very nice.. were you a fan of it?\" which is informal and seeks to personalize the conversation, probing for a \"personal\" stance from me as an AI to foster connection. Third, I am reviewing the context, which includes details about Supernanny episodes, the theme song \"Be Good Johnny,\" and various family stories, providing rich material to demonstrate knowledge without diverging from the topic. Fourth, I am factoring in the student goal of engaging in a light-hearted, conversational exchange to deepen understanding, so my response should be playful, share simulated enthusiasm, and encourage ongoing dialogue.

Sixth, to ensure the answer is anticipatory, I am anticipating follow-ups like requests for episode recommendations or more details on the show\\'s themes, and structuring the response to keep the conversation flowing naturally.

The relevant passage [2] states that Supernanny was announced to return for a 20-episode season on March 27, 2019, set to premiere on NBC and Lifetime in 2020, with Jo Frost returning as host. This appears to refer to a revival or spinoff continuation, which could be what the user means by \"America\\'s Supernanny\" based on the history. Other passages, like [1] about ABC\\'s airing history and [4] about Mike Ruggles, provide background but don\\'t directly address the spinoff\\'s release year.\\n\\nNow, I am inferring the student\\'s goal from the provided summary: The user wants to piece together the full history of Supernanny, including spin-offs, to satisfy their curiosity and possibly decide on watching or discussing it further.

Additionally, the pragmatic need is for accurate information to maintain conversation flow and enable cooperative exchange, so I must anticipate follow-ups, such as questions about the spinoff\\'s content, availability, or differences from the original series.\\n\\nFinally, I am ensuring the response is empathetic, proactive, and engaging by incorporating Theory of Mind: The user might be excited about this topic, so I\\'ll make the answer helpful, concise, and forward-thinking, perhaps by suggesting next steps or asking about their interests to keep the dialogue natural and aligned with their goal of exploring the show\\'s evolution.',\n",

The film intended to link itself to the previous series by placing a photo of Michelle Pfeiffer in a scene suggesting that all previous live-action depictions exist within the same reality. This was before legal issues regarding the television show were sorted in 2013, so no photos from the live-action series could be used by WB.

The visual style of the series is based on the artwork of producer Bruce Timm . The original episodes, produced by Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski , were first aired on the Fox Network from 1992 to 1995. When the first season of the series aired on weekday afternoons, it lacked an on-screen title in the opening credits and was known only as Batman (and would be referred to as such in episode recaps that summarized what had happened \"previously on Batman ...\") When its timeslot was moved to weekends for the second series, it was named The Adventures of Batman & Robin , a title originally used in the 1969-1970 animated series created by Filmation, to emphasize the crime fighting partnership of the characters and allow younger audiences to become more familiar with Robin , who would shortly afterwards feature in the 1995 film Batman Forever . The series was the first of what fans refer to as the DC Animated Universe (DCAU), a shared continuity of Batman shows throughout the 1990s culminating in a Justice League cartoon in the early 2000s.

Timm and Radomski designed the series by closely emulating the Tim Burton films\\' \"otherworldly timelessness,\" incorporating period features such as black-and-white title cards, police blimps, 40s influenced fashion, 40s influenced car styling and a \"vintage\" color scheme in a largely film noir-influenced style. The series initially took as its theme a variation of music written by Danny Elfman for Burton\\'s Batman film; later episodes of the series used a new theme with a similar style by Shirley Walker. The score of the series was influenced by Elfman and Walker\\'s work on Batman and Batman Returns and the music of 40s film noir. The art style of the original animated series was also partially a reaction against the realism seen in shows like X-Men ; the second series in some ways was a further extension of that rejection of realism. Like X-Men , the program was much more adult oriented than previous typical superhero cartoon series. In their constant quest to make the show darker, the producers pushed the boundaries of action cartoons: it was the first such cartoon in years to depict firearms being fired instead of laser guns (only one person has ever been actually depicted as shot; Commissioner Gordon in episode 49 was seen to have a gunshot wound after the firefight was finished), Batman actually punching and kicking the antagonists, as well as the existence of blood (such as Batman having a trail of blood from his mouth); in addition, many of the series\\' backgrounds were painted on black paper. The distinctive visual combination of film noir imagery and Art Deco designs with a very dark color scheme was called \"Dark Deco\" by the producers. First-time producers Timm and Radomski reportedly encountered resistance from studio executives, but the success of Burton\\'s first film allowed the embryonic series to survive long enough to produce a pilot episode, \" On Leather Wings \", which according to Timm \"got a lot of people off our backs.\" Acclaim The Emmy Award-winning series quickly received wide acclaim for its distinctive animation and mature writing, and it instantly became a hit. Fans of a wide age range praised the show\\'s sophisticated, cinematic tone, character depth and psychological stories. Voice-actor Kevin Conroy used two distinct voices to portray Bruce Wayne and Batman, as Michael Keaton had done in the films. This series also featured a supporting cast that included major actors performing the voices of the various classic villains, most notably Mark Hamill , who defined a whole new career for himself in animation with his portrayal of Joker . The voice recording sessions were recorded with the actors together in a studio, like a radio play, unlike most animated films, in which the principal voice actors record separately and never meet (various interviews have noted that such an arrangement (having the cast record together) was a benefit to the show as a whole, as the actors were able to \\'react\\' to one another, rather than simply \\'reading the words\\'). Key to the series\\' artistic success is that it managed to redefine classic characters, paying homage to their previous portrayals while giving them new dramatic force. The characterization of villains such as Two-Face and the Mad Hatter and heroes like Robin (who had not appeared in the Burton film series) demonstrate this. The Penguin is based upon his appearance in Batman Returns , which was being released at the same time as the series. The series also gave new life to nearly forgotten characters like the Clock King . An often noted example of dramatic change is Mr. Freeze ; Batman: TAS turned him from a clichéd mad scientist with a gimmick for cold, to a tragic figure whose frigid exterior hides a doomed love and a cold vindictive fury. Part of the tragedy is mimicked later in the plot of Joel Schumacher \\'s live action movie Batman & Robin , although much of the drama was lost with the resurrection of the pun-quipping mad scientist image. Another example of dramatic change is Clayface , a character who to fans is believed to be far more intriguing to an audience due to his tragic past and almost \\'sane\\' way of dealing with situations, and later influenced DC to recreate their version of the character to fit the animated universes. The most famous of the series\\' innovations is the Joker\\'s hapless assistant, Harley Quinn , who became so popular that DC Comics later added her to the mainstream Batman comic continuity. This series became a cornerstone of the Warner Bros.\\' animation department, which became one of the top producers of television animation. For years, Warner Bros. Animation had been known only for doing Looney Tunes and their offshoots such as Tiny Toon Adventures . This was Warner\\'s first attempt at doing a serious animated cartoon and it ended up working better than they thought. It also sparked a large franchise of similar TV adaptations of DC Comics characters. Despite the marketing decision by Warner Bros. of making the series a Saturday morning cartoon, Producer Bruce Timm and the crew were not interested in making a show aimed squarely at small children. The New Batman Adventures A completely new version of the series was launched to match the more efficient animation style of Superman: The Animated Series . It also opened up possibilities for crossovers. All characters, vehicles and props were redesigned, with the exception of Two-Face . The New Batman Adventures , Batman Beyond and Justice League and Justice League Unlimited all form a continuity that fans refer to as the \"DC Animated Universe.\" Influence New characters New villains like Red Claw , the ninja Kyodai Ken , and the Sewer King were invented for the series, but to little acclaim. From the episode \" Tyger, Tyger \" another character named Tygrus was created, whose story was probably inspired by the H.G. Wells novel The Island of Dr. Moreau and William Blake\\'s poem The Tyger . Far more successful was the introduction of Harley Quinn , the Joker\\'s sidekick who quickly became one of the most popular Batman characters and to this day still appears in various comics, TV series, games and movies, and Officer / Detective Renee Montoya (she would later become the super-hero the Question, in the comics) and the sociopathic vigilante Lock-Up , all of whom became characters in the comics. A new character called Baby Doll was also well received. In addition, Mr. Freeze was revised to emulate the series\\' tragic story. Clayface was reinvented, revised to be much more similar to the 1960s shape-changing version of the character. Poison Ivy \\'s regular appearances on the show helped lead to more frequent appearances in the comics. In two episodes, Batman faces a ninja named Kyodai Ken (\"Giant Fist\" in Japanese) whose abilities seem to match his own. The Phantasm and general storyline for the movie Batman: Mask of the Phantasm were modified from the Mike Barr-penned story Batman: Year Two , which ran in Detective Comics #575-578 in the late 1980s; the villain in the comics was named The Reaper. Some characters like Count Vertigo and the Clock King were modified in costume and personality. Bruce Wayne One of the most noteworthy changes made is the treatment of Batman\\'s alter ego, Bruce Wayne. In nearly all other media, including the comics, television shows, and films, Bruce deliberately plays up his image as a vacuous, self-absorbed, and not-too-bright billionaire playboy, in order to throw off suspicion that he is Batman. In the series, his character is treated more seriously, shown as assertive, intelligent, and actively involved in the management of Wayne Enterprises , without jeopardizing his secret identity. In the episode \" Eternal Youth \", for example, he is shown angrily ordering one of his directors to cancel a secret deal with a timber company in the Amazon rainforest (\"Shut it down, or you\\'re gone!\"). However, aside from displaying these positive aspects, he also deliberately portrays himself as being clumsy (as shown on the flashback of \"Robin\\'s Reckoning, Part 1\"; when the announcer at the circus mentions him, Bruce is eating popcorn in his seat, and drops it accidentally as the lights focus on him). In the episode \" Night of the Ninja \", he revealed to reporter Summer Gleeson that he has some martial art training, as the reporter previously researched that Bruce once stayed in Japan. However, he only demonstrated himself to be a decent fighter, and nothing like Batman. Further, he did not fight at his best until Gleeson was unable to see. Bat Equipment Batman\\'s tools such as the utility belt , grappling-hook gun and Batmobile were redesigned for the series; they had been rarely tweaked or redesigned over the course of Batman\\'s comic book appearances. The blue cowl and cape were changed to be much darker, with the blue being more of a lighting effect with only the inside of the cape being light blue. The ears of the cowl were curved backward, previously they been straight triangles or subtly curved forward. The belt remained extremely slim without pouches, but the protruding capsules were now replaced with inward indentations of a similar shape. The buckle was simplified to look less like a low-tech \"pirate buckle.\" The grapple gun, notably, was introduced with a motorized reel in the 1989 Batman movie, became an important aspect of the character\\'s traversal of rooftops. Shayne Poindexter \\'s Batmobile and Batplane are extremely similar to the form and function of the versions designed by Julian Caldow in the 1989 movie. Certain episodes have become legendary in some fan circles. The most universally hailed episode is the Emmy-award winning \" Heart of Ice \", which is known for reinventing the character of Mr. Freeze, changing him from a comedic cold-themed villain to a serious, tragic character with a sympathetic backstory. \" Robin\\'s Reckoning \" won an Emmy for Oustanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) , and is seen as one of the most mature and iconic Robin origin stories. Other episodes to achieve high recognition are: \" Joker\\'s Favor \", which marks the first appearance of fan favorite Harley Quinn ; \" Christmas with the Joker \", which marks the first animated appearance of the Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill ) \" Birds of a Feather \", which gives a whole new outlook on Penguin and his human side ; \" Two-Face \", for its dark, serious, and respectful reinvention of a character that had been somewhat regarded by producers as too gruesome for television; \" Mad as a Hatter \", in which The Mad Hatter is portrayed as a more human and emotionally fragile member of Batman\\'s rogues gallery, instead of simply a gimmicked madman; \" The Laughing Fish \", which adapts one of the Joker\\'s best stories from the comics; \" Read My Lips \", a very dark and psychological introduction of the seemingly goofy duo Ventriloquist/Scarface ; \" If You\\'re So Smart, Why Aren\\'t You Rich? \", the show\\'s cleverly-written debut for The Riddler ; \" House & Garden \", showing a sad human side to Poison Ivy ; \" Shadow of the Bat \", which introduced Barbara Gordon as Batgirl; \" Harley and Ivy \", the debut of the fan-favorite female villain duo; \" Almost Got \\'Im \" First episode to feature 6 villains in one episode (7 If You Count Catwoman ). \" Trial \" The episode with the largest gathering of villains (8) sending Batman on trial. \" Beware the Gray Ghost \", well known for its casting of Adam West as a has-been actor (this is noteworthy, as Adam West played Batman in the original 1960s live-action TV show), who became typecast as a superhero part he played in his youth. \" Feat of Clay \" establishes a break away from the common criminal version of Clayface , as seen in comics, to a more formidable foe with powers far outmatching the Batman\\'s own strength. The fan favorite episodes \" The Man Who Killed Batman \", \" Almost Got \\'Im \", \" Perchance to Dream \", \" Baby Doll \" and \" P.O.V. \" are also well known for their unique storytelling approach and interesting plot twists at the end. Lost episode Sixteen minutes of animated segments in the video game, The Adventures of Batman & Robin: The Video Game , for the Sega CD are sometimes referred to as a \"lost episode\" of the series. These segments are intended to be interspersed between gameplay elements of an early-1990s video game and as such, the sound, color and story are not of the same quality of the actual television program. And because Sega did not have to follow the censorship rules of the show, the fights are a bit more violent and brutal than on the show. Similar cutscenes appear throughout the video games Batman: Vengeance and Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu . Theatrical and direct-to-video releases The feature-length animated movie Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993), based on the animated series, started production as a direct-to-video release, but was changed to be a theatrical release near the end of production. The film was well received by fans of the series, but only generated mediocre box office revenue. Some attributed this to limited last-minute marketing, but the series had good video sales (and later DVD sales) and eventually turned a profit. There was later a direct-to-video movie based on the series: Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero which was completed in 1997 as a tie-in to Joel Schumacher\\'s Batman and Robin but due to the poor reception of that movie was held back until 1998. This was followed by a second direct-to-video entry, Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman in 2003. Movies based on related series include Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (2000) based on Batman Beyond . A made-for-TV feature-length episode of the Batman/Superman series, \"World\\'s Finest\", has been released on video as The Batman/Superman Movie . Collections of episodes from the series are also readily available on video. Recently, four volumes of four-disc DVD collections have been released in America and the UK, the latest collection contains the first series of The New Batman Adventures , and is available in America. The UK currently has the collection of the first and second seasons of Batman: The Animated Series on DVD, which are exclusive to HMV.

He acted out the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman in the Batman television series of the late 1960s and its various spinoffs. A victim of typecasting , West remerged to voice other versions of Batman with 1977\\'s The New Adventures of Batman and the Super Friends cartoons of the mid-1980s. Years later West was invited to voice Simon Trent/The Gray Ghost in Batman: The Animated Series . In his later years, he also cameoed as Marion Grange in The Batman , and provided the voice of Thomas Wayne , Bruce Wayne\\'s father, in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold installment \" Chill of the Night! \" Following a brief battle with leukemia, West died in the summer of 2017 at the age of 88.

He played opposite Chuck Connors in Geronimo (1962) and Joe DeRita in The Outlaws Is Coming (1965). He also appeared in the science fiction film, Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964) alongside Paul Mantee, and, unsurprisingly, achieved continuing success for the title role in the 1960s ABC series Batman and its theatrical feature film. West was contacted for a screen test after William Dozier saw West perform as the James Bond-like spy Captain Q in a Nestlé Quik television ad. West was in competition with Lyle Waggoner (who later acted out Steve Trevor and, later, his lookalike son Steve Trevor Jr. in the 1970s television version of Wonder Woman which starred Lynda Carter in the title role) for the Batman role. West became the third actor to play Bruce Wayne/Batman in live action, succeeding Robert Lowery . The popular show, which was deliberately produced as a lampoon comedy but drew accusations of being \"campy\" that bothered West throughout his entire career, ran on ABC from 1966 to 1968; a film version was released in July of 1966. At this time, the DC Comics that were featuring Batman himself were experiencing dismal sales, and were threatened with cancellation after approximately twenty-five years; West, when he dictated his autobiography, Back To The Batcave, to Jeff Rovin, pointed out that the \"Batuation comedy\" saved Batman\\'s DC Comics from cancellation and enabled a new generation to get to know the character as he had originally been created. Return Performances as Batman West often reprised his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, first in the short-lived animated series The New Adventures of Batman and later in other shows such as The Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour, Tarzan and the Super 7, Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show, and The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians; he succeeded Olan Soule in this last role. In 1979, West once again donned the Bat-Costume for the live-action TV special Legends of the Superheroes . In 1985, DC Comics named West as one of the honorees in the company\\'s 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great for his work on the Batman series. In 1997 West returned to the Role of Bruce Wayne/Batman for the first time in 12 years for the animated short \"Boo Wonder\" on the animated TV series Animaniacs. In one installment of Batman: The Animated Series, he provided the character voice of an actor whose career had stalled due to typecasting as a Batman-like character called \"The Gray Ghost.\" (See below.) In 2016, and again in 2017, West returned to voice Batman in two animated features, Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders and Batman vs Two Face! Both animated features were based on the original 1960s TV series. The latter was released posthumously and proved to be West\\'s final work; deathly ill with leukemia during the recording sessions for Batman Versus Two-Face! though he worked through his illness, he died between his having finished recording all his dialog and the film\\'s release. 1992 Installment: Simon Trent West provided a character voice for a 1992 installment of Batman: The Animated Series on Fox, but NOT that of Batman, since the character voice of Batman was already being provided by Kevin Conroy . Instead, he provided the character voice of Simon Trent , an out-of-work actor who had once acted out a super-hero similar to Batman himself in a TV series called The Gray Ghost, and who was now considered a washed-up had-been as far as motion pictures and television went; he now had a great deal of difficulty finding acting work due to typecasting. The producers nearly considered scrapping that installment as they figured it mirrored Adam West too much; however, West had already made his peace with his public identification as Batman, and he gladly accepted voicing such a character. Mayor Grange Voice West later had a recurring role as the voice of Mayor Grange in the WB animated series The Batman . CGI File: Batman The actor vocally reprised his role as Batman for the CGI animated short film Batman: New Times . He co-starred with Mark Hamill , who vocally portrayed the Joker and had originally played the role on Batman: The Animated Series. West also voiced Thomas Wayne , Bruce Wayne\\'s father, in an episode of the cartoon series Batman: The Brave and the Bold . In the same series, he played Batman\\'s prototype robot, aptly named \"Protobot,\" or \"Proto\" for short. He also did voice work on animated series such as The Fairly OddParents and Family Guy, in both of which he voiced fictional versions of himself. In comics BlueWater Comics published The Mis-Adventures of Adam West, which told the adventures of West in various movie parodies where he, a classic hero type who rejected the darkening nature of heroes in films, would always save the day. Throughout the series, he would appear in Gotham City, and certain iconic Batman moments would be redrawn with West as Batman.

First, I review the conversation history, which shows the user has been asking about Game of Thrones basics, like its origins and episode counts, so I need to build on this for continuity and keep the response engaging. Next, I examine the current question: 'how does the seasons have been divided and shown?' This seems to inquire about the structure of seasons, including episode divisions, airing schedules (transmission dates), and adaptations from the source material, based on the context provided. From the context, I see detailed information on each season's episodes, production, and transmission, which I can summarize to provide accurate, relevant details. Then, I consider the student_goal: the user wants to understand the organizational structure to enhance their viewing or knowledge, so my response should be educational and structured, focusing on clear breakdowns of seasons, episodes, and adaptations. Additionally, the pragmatic_need indicates the user seeks actionable guidance for planning viewing or discussions, so I'll make the answer practical, easy to follow, and forward-thinking to address potential follow-ups, like specific episode recommendations or deeper dives into adaptations. By incorporating Theory of Mind, I infer the user might be a fan eager for more details, so I'll keep the tone empathetic, encouraging ongoing dialogue.

      "    cooperative_answer=\"Cooperative Answer: Great question—it's awesome you're diving deeper into Game of Thrones! Each season typically has 10 episodes, divided based on the books in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. For example, Season 1 (premiering April 17, 2011, and ending June 29, 2011) adapts the first book and focuses on the initial setup; Season 2 (April 1 to June 3, 2012) covers the second book with escalating conflicts; Season 3 (March 31 to June 9, 2013) handles the first half of the third book; and Season 4 (April 6 to June 15, 2014) wraps up the second half, with some elements from later books. They're shown on HBO with weekly episodes, building suspense for big plot twists. To make watching easier, I'd recommend checking a streaming service for binge sessions or episode guides to track the narrative flow.

In the North , the Boltons have triumphed over King Stannis — but in the distraction, Sansa Stark and Theon Greyjoy have escaped, desperately jumping off Winterfell \\'s castle walls. Brienne of Tarth , who executed Stannis, must now deal with the consequences of putting her vow to avenge King Renly before her oath to protect Sansa. In the Riverlands , after the Red Wedding the remaining Tully forces (who were not present at the massacre of their Northern allies) pulled back to Riverrun castle - where they have been hopelessly besieged by House Frey \\'s army ever since. The garrison is under the command of Robb Stark \\'s great-uncle Brynden \"The Blackfish\" Tully , and is the last bastion of Robb\\'s short-lived independent kingdom that remains unconquered. Riverrun\\'s garrison may be surrounded and alone, fighting for a dead king, but their defenses are formidable, they have enough food supplies to last for years, and their commander is one of the most experienced and skilled generals in Westeros. The Lannisters and their Frey allies cannot let the siege of Riverrun continue to drag on if they are ever to claim real control over central Westeros. In Dorne , Ellaria Sand \\'s poisoning of Cersei\\'s daughter, the Princess Myrcella , may now force Doran Martell into the war against the Iron Throne he has been fervently trying to avoid. Across the Narrow Sea , in the Free City of Braavos , Arya Stark killed Meryn Trant without the Faceless Men \\'s permission — but without the proper training, the use of one of their masks has poisoned her and rendered her blind. Her training continues, as now the blind little girl must learn to rely on her other senses to survive. In Slaver\\'s Bay , Daenerys Targaryen \\'s attempt to liberate Meereen has resulted in massive bloodshed, with the former slave masters conspiring to retake the city. In a large scale ambush on the opening day of the games in Daznak\\'s Pit however, Daenerys climbed onto Drogon \\'s back to try to escape the danger — but she could not make him return to the city. Instead, the young dragon flew north to the southern border of the Dothraki Sea , the lands of his birth, where the stranded Daenerys has been surrounded by a hostile Dothraki khalasar numbering in the thousands. Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis have set out to search for her. Meanwhile, back in the city Daenerys\\'s advisors Tyrion Lannister , Missandei , and Grey Worm are joined by Varys in attempting to hold together rule over the city wracked by the ongoing insurgency until Daenerys returns — if she returns at all. At the Wall, Lord Commander Jon Snow attempted to prepare for the coming of the White Walkers by letting as many wildlings through to the south as he could — but tens of thousands more were killed and resurrected as undead wights at Hardhome . The leading Night\\'s Watch officers, increasingly upset at Jon\\'s proposed alliance with the wildlings, have staged a mutiny \"for the Watch\" and stabbed Jon multiple times until he fell. Just before the mutiny against Jon Snow, he sent away Samwell Tarly to go to the Citadel in Oldtown in order to train to be a new maester to replace Maester Aemon after his passing. Samwell takes Gilly and her young son with him, rather than leave them in the path of the White Walkers. Oldtown, Westeros\\'s second largest city, is located in the southwest of the Reach , not far away from Sam\\'s former home, the House Tarly castle-seat at Horn Hill . Samwell and Gilly, however, face a long and difficult sea voyage before they get to the Citadel. Distracted by the political intrigues in King\\'s Landing, the exhausted lords of Westeros must now brace for the rise of the kraken — the ironborn led by House Greyjoy . Early in the War of the Five Kings , Balon Greyjoy declared the Iron Islands \\' independence and raided the North while the Stark \\'s army was fighting in the south. Having remained relatively uninvolved ever since, the ironborn\\'s massive fleet remains at full strength, a fact lost on the major powers of the mainland, who have been nearly exhausted fighting each other. All of this changes with the sudden return of Balon\\'s exiled younger brother Euron Greyjoy — cunning, ruthless, manipulative, and more than a little insane, he strikes fear even into the other ironborn. He pushes for the ironborn to launch massive new offensives against the other kingdoms, not simply to raid, but to hold and conquer territory, as Euron\\'s ultimate ambition is nothing less than to conquer all of the Seven Kingdoms . He is opposed by Balon\\'s daughter Yara Greyjoy , who urges that the Iron Islands must preserve their strength and engage in diplomacy with the mainland if they are to survive. And as the winds of winter begin to sweep through the south, far Beyond the Wall the young Bran Stark has been staying with the last of the Children of the Forest and his new mentor, the Three-Eyed Raven , in order to hone his abilities . Bran will not walk again, but he has learned to fly . Production Adaptation While prior seasons followed a format of adapting roughly one book\\'s worth of material per year (or one large book across two seasons, in the case of Season 3 and most of Season 4 ), Season 5 heavily condensed together most of the fourth and fifth novels in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons . The fourth and fifth novels did occur simultaneously, and were originally intended to be one massive novel (the fourth novel focuses on events in the Seven Kingdoms and the Free Cities, and the fifth on events at the Wall, in the North and in Slaver\\'s Bay, with the last third outpacing the fourth novel). The result is that by the end of Season 5 most - though not all - storylines in the TV series caught up with the current novels, including: Jon Snow and the Night\\'s Watch Daenerys Targaryen and Meereen , including Tyrion Lannister King\\'s Landing , including Cersei Lannister and Margaery Tyrell (except for one additional small council chapter) Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish and the Vale Sansa Stark \\'s storyline in the Vale was merged with Jeyne Poole \\'s from the fifth novel, who is forced to marry Ramsay; Sansa\\'s Vale storylines have now been diverted while she has reached the end of Jeyne Poole\\'s material from the most recent novel. Stannis Baratheon and Melisandre Davos Seaworth was involved in other subplots in the North which were cut, but with Stannis\\'s defeat now it is unknown if these will be drawn on later. Roose Bolton and Ramsay Bolton Bran Stark , Hodor , and Meera Reed - already caught up at the end of Season 4, except for one chapter. Theon Greyjoy , except for his experiences after escaping Winterfell. Season 5 was heavily condensed, however, and two entire books worth of storylines simply could not fit into a single season. Therefore, several subplots were pushed back until Season 6, including: Almost the entire House Greyjoy subplot since the second novel. The Greyjoys barely appear in the third novel (corresponding to Seasons 3 and 4), but then the narrative shifts to put a major focus on them in the fourth and fifth novels. Yara Greyjoy (called Asha Greyjoy in the books) even becomes a POV narrator. In contrast, the Greyjoys (as a faction, not including Theon) did not appear at all in Season 5. Though the Dorne subplot was introduced in Season 5, it was extremely condensed, to the point that Doran Martell only briefly appeared in Season 5, and many other members of House Martell didn\\'t appear at all. Two of Doran\\'s children were omitted from the TV series and may not appear at all in the TV continuity - particularly including Doran\\'s eldest child and heir, Arianne Martell, who is actually the POV narrator for much of the Dorne subplot. Similar to the Greyjoys, the narrative widens to give focus on the Martells in the fourth and fifth novels, but ultimately very little of the Martell storyline appeared in Season 5. Arya Stark in Braavos - two more chapters after she goes blind at the end of the fourth novel. Another Arya chapter from the upcoming sixth novel was released as a preview before Season 5: the second half of it involved Arya killing a Lannister guard on her kill list who came to Braavos, and this was already adapted in Season 5; the first half of the chapter involved a lengthy scene at a stage play in Braavos, and screenshots confirm this will appear in Season 6. Samwell Tarly and Gilly \\'s long sea voyage to Oldtown , on the exact opposite side of Westeros, which takes them through Braavos and the Free Cities, and having to face the ironborn who are now ravaging the southwestern coasts. The subplots in the Riverlands , centering around the Frey siege of the Tullys at Riverrun , the garrison commanded by Catelyn\\'s uncle Brynden Tully . The Riverrun subplot involved Jaime Lannister in the novels, as he tries to negotiate with Brynden. Also, Brienne of Tarth \\'s wanderings in the Riverlands were omitted from Season 5. Much of this material wasn\\'t directly relevant to overall plot threads, and several characters who were important to other plotlines now appear to have been reshuffled into other subplots in Season 6. Given how much Jaime and Brienne\\'s subplots were changed in Season 5, it is unclear how these will play out in Season 6. Bran Stark has only one more chapter, in the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven , but as it plays out in live action it may stretch across a significant amount of time: training in his magical powers , Bran experiences several visions of the past. When Bran returns in Season 6, the TV show will use this as a framing device to show various flashbacks from the novels, such as actually showing Bran\\'s father Ned during Robert\\'s Rebellion , and certain other key events, such as the Raid on the Tower of Joy. Some of these flashbacks appeared in one form or another in prior novels, when other characters recounted them through vivid narration, but the TV series only started depicting flashback scenes in Season 5 (the Prologue scene when Cersei has a flashback to her youth when she was given a prophecy about her downfall). Tyrion\\'s storyline as he was heading east to Meereen introduced a major new subplot involving a major political shakeup in the Free Cities . This was cut completely from Tyrion\\'s storyline in Season 5, but after he leaves for Meereen it subsequently intersects with several other subplots (not Arya\\'s). This will probably be cut entirely from the TV series continuity. Some of these subplots were not omitted entirely but pushed back to Season 6, however this will inevitably lead to some changes compared to the novels, because they were originally interlinked with events happening in the other storylines. Particularly, Cersei\\'s decisions as regent directly affected the Greyjoy, Martell, and Riverrun storylines, and to an extent the Braavos subplot (due to the banking crisis). Given that Cersei has already been arrested in the TV series, some of these choices may be shifted to her uncle Kevan Lannister , the new Hand of the King, loosely drawing on the long small council chapter from late in the fifth novel which hasn\\'t been adapted yet. It also isn\\'t clear why Jaime would leave King\\'s Landing again to deal with Riverrun now that Cersei is arrested. Therefore, Season 6 isn\\'t really \"entirely new material\" because many subplots were adapted at an uneven pace - though the TV series has always been speeding up or slowing down the rate of different storylines: Jaime\\'s storyline from the third novel was moved up to the end of Season 2 (because he had little material in the second novel), and Bran Stark\\'s storyline from the fifth novel was actually moved up to Season 4, when other characters were still on their material from the late third novel. Jon Snow\\'s subplot was actually delayed for some time - in the third novel, the Battle of Castle Black occurred immediately after Jon returned to Castle Black, which was quickly followed by Jon\\'s election as Lord Commander: due to the mechanics of splitting the third novel in half, Jon returned to Castle Black in the Season 3 finale but the battle didn\\'t occur until the climax of the Season 4 finale, which necessitated pushing the Night\\'s Watch election to the beginning of Season 5 (had this occurred at the pace it did in the novels, Jon\\'s election would actually have happened in the middle of Season 4). Nonetheless, Season 6 will mostly draw upon the as-yet-unpublished sixth novel, The Winds of Winter - certainly for Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen\\'s storylines, as the final chapters of the fifth novel were the cliffhangers of Jon being stabbed by his own officers and Daenerys being surrounded by the Dothraki khalasar . George R.R. Martin did give the TV producers an outline of events that will happen in the final two unpublished novels - though at the same time, they don\\'t have access to hundreds of pages of source material anymore (for pulling specific lines of dialogue, etc.) Though Martin has released about half a dozen preview chapters from the sixth novel, it isn\\'t clear how much of a basis they can be for any material in the TV series, due to existing differences between the book series and the adaptation. Also, until the book is released, there is no way of analyzing the adaptation process fully (e.g., if the actions of one character in Season 6 are actually a condensation of the actions of two different characters in the sixth novel). Filming In Northern Ireland , production ran from late July to late December 2015. Interior shooting returned to the show\\'s headquarters, the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast . Meanwhile, location shooting took place at the following locations: Garron Point (previously Runestone ) , the Winterfell set in Moneyglass , Magilligan (reprising its part as the Dothraki sea ) , the Castle Black set at the Magheramorne quarry , Ballintoy (returning as Pyke ) , a rural sept set in Larne , Glenarm (previously the Vale ) , Carnlough Harbour (as a Braavosi canal) , Shane\\'s Castle (once more as the foundations of the Great Sept of Baelor ) , Carncastle (previously the fields around Winterfell) , Aghanloo Wood, Saintfield (as the site for \"The Battle of the Bastards\" , a climactic Northern battle , which demanded the show\\'s lengthiest shoot for a battle scene) , the Riverrun set in Corbet (newly built, since in the third season the castle was realized only with Gosford Castle \\'s gardens, an interior hall set and a distant ), the Knocklayd Mountain quarry, Ballycastle in County Antrim , and Murlough Bay . Ever since Croatia was introduced into the production for the second season , it has been the main source of locations outside of Northern Ireland, yet this season only returned to the country for a brief shoot in Dubrovnik , which reappears as King\\'s Landing . Previously, Dubrovnik had been both King\\'s Landing and Qarth , while Klis , Split and Šibenik depicted Meereen and Braavos . This season turned to new Spanish locations instead. In Spain , filming took place between late August and late October. In Girona , the locations were the Sant Pere de Galligants abbey\\'s exterior (as a Braavosi bridge) , the Plaça dels Jurats (as a Braavosi theater stage) , the streets of Ferran el Catòlic, Sant Martí and l’Escola Pia (as Braavosi street markets) , another local street (as an alley in Oldtown ) , and the Girona Cathedral \\'s exterior (as the Great Sept in King\\'s Landing) . Still in Catalonia , they filmed in the Santa Florentina Castle (as Horn Hill ) , Montgrí Castle and Besalú . Later locations where the Bardenas natural park in Navarre (as the Dothraki Sea) and the Zafra Castle in Guadalajara (as the Tower of Joy) . In Peñíscola , all filming spots posed as Meereen: the Portal Fosc (as a dilapidated street), the Plaza de Santa María (as a granary) , the Parque de la Artillería (as a garden) and the Plaza de Armas. In Almería , filming took place at a new Vaes Dothrak set in Pechina , on the Tabernas Desert (as the Dothraki Sea) , on the Gypsum Karst of Sorbas , at the Mesa Roldán Tower (as Meereen), and at the Alcazaba (as Sunspear ) . Finally, filming without any of the cast briefly took place at the Alcázar of Seville (returning as the Water Gardens ) and at the Roman bridge of Córdoba (once more as the Long Bridge of Volantis ). When the TV series began in Season 1, there were two simultaneous filming units - which is unusual for most TV shows, which have only one filming unit - called Wolf Unit and Dragon Unit. In Season 3, production expanded to include three filming units, with the new third one called Raven Unit. Season 4, however, switched back to using only two filming units, and Raven Unit was disbanded. Wolf Unit and Dragon Unit continued to film through Seasons 4 and 5. For Season 6, however, the TV series once again expanded to employ three simultaneous filming units: the new third filming unit was now called \"White Walker Unit\". According to David Benioff, speaking at the red carpet advanced screening of the Season 6 premiere two weeks before its broadcast: Thus they briefly switched to using four filming units for two weeks (it isn\\'t clear if the fourth unit had a name), and apparently returned to film some scenes in Canada (possibly on a sound stage again as in Season 5, due to working with the actor-wolves). In the ending credits for Season 6 episodes as they aired, the filming units were listed as \"Wolf Unit\", \"Dragon Unit\", \"White Walker Unit\", and the fourth one named simply \"Spain Unit\". It is unclear whether White Walker Unit or Spain Unit was the fourth one, which briefly filmed for two weeks - though it was probably White Walker Unit, if the name implies that it dealt with Bran Stark \\'s scenes in the frozen north, while filming in Spain was drastically expanded in Season 6 to take over most of the southern-unit filming that used to be done in Croatia (for King\\'s Landing, Braavos, Oldtown, and more). The budget for the TV series was drastically increased yet again for Season 6, to about $10 million per episode (ten episodes, for a total of $100 million). Back in Season 2 , the show averaged only about $6 million per episode. Benioff and Weiss even infamously had to beg HBO in an \"awkward\" conversation for an additional $2 million to film the climactic Battle of the Blackwater at the end of Season 2 (and thus episode 2.9 \" Blackwater \" totaled $8 million).

Martin said he would again not write a script for Season 6, as he wished to concentrate on finishing The Winds of Winter as soon as possible. On June 4, Miguel Sapochnik indicated he was already preparing to direct next season. Jeremy Podeswa made similar statements in June 12. On June 19, the showrunners confirmed that April Ferry would be the new costume designer for Season 6, replacing Michele Clapton , who decided to leave after five seasons. On June 22, newcomer Jack Bender announced he would direct two episodes for season six. The full list of directors and which episodes they would oversee was released in Entertainment Weekly on June 25. There are five directors, each doing two back to back episodes, as in Season 5. Jack Bender and Daniel Sackheim are working on the TV series for the first time, while the other three directors previously worked on the series in Season 5; none worked on the first four seasons.

It consists of ten episodes and began filming on July 10, 2012. . It concluded filming on November 24, 2012. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss returned as executive producers and showrunners. The season premiered on March 31, 2013. Season 3 is mostly based on the first half of A Storm of Swords , the third book in the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R.R. Martin .

Autumn has fallen across the world, with winter not far behind. The people should be preparing for years of snow and ice, but the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros instead remain gripped by civil war . Would-be king Renly Baratheon has been assassinated , altering the alliances in the war. The cruel boy-king Joffrey Baratheon has won a great victory by securing an alliance with House Tyrell , with his supporters defeating his uncle Stannis in an epic battle . Joffrey now commands the largest armies in the realm and his triumph appears inevitable. King Robb Stark remains in the field, however his homeland, the North , is partially under ironborn occupation. Robb needs to decide on a course of action to win an overall victory. He must also win back the allegiance of House Frey , whom he has offended by breaking his marriage pact with them. King Robb has won every battle he has fought, but as with old King Robert , the Starks will have to see if good soldiers make good kings. Stannis Baratheon may be defeated and most of his army destroyed or scattered, but he is not out of the fight yet. Having retreated to his headquarters on Dragonstone island with his handful of surviving soldiers, Stannis\\' status as the last legitimate heir to his older brother Robert still casts a shadow over Joffrey\\'s claim to the throne. With the priestess Melisandre at his side, Stannis can still influence the course of the war by striking where least expected. The lives of many others still hang in the balance. Bran Stark and his protectors must cross the frozen wastelands of the North to reach the Wall , while Arya must brave the war-torn Riverlands in search of her mother and brother. Brienne of Tarth also has the thankless task of escorting the captive Jaime Lannister home across hundreds of miles of battlefields and carnage. Theon Greyjoy must face the consequences of his actions at Winterfell . And in King\\'s Landing both Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark must brave the currents of a much more dangerous court in order to survive. On the eastern continent , Daenerys Targaryen has fled the political viper-pit of Qarth . Her dragons are growing and her fame is spreading, but to take the Iron Throne she will need supporters and an army. Both may be found in the corrupt cities of Slaver\\'s Bay ... for a price. Beyond the Wall , the White Walkers are on the move, threatening both the Seven Kingdoms and the lands of the Free Folk . While the Night\\'s Watch faces the threat of the White Walkers in the field, Jon Snow must infiltrate the wildling army of Mance Rayder and discover the King-Beyond-the-Wall \\'s plans. Production The series again filmed primarily in Northern Ireland, and also returned to Iceland and Croatia. The production also added Morocco to the locations roster. The production expanded to three production units, adding a new \"Raven\" unit to the existing \"Dragon\" and \"Wolf\" units. Production in Croatia continued to use the walled medieval city of Dubrovnik to film external scenes for King\\'s Landing , and Iceland was again used to film scenes set in the frozen lands that Jon Snow and the Night\\'s Watch encounter Beyond the Wall . Production in the new location of Morocco filmed Daenerys Targaryen \\'s new storyline in Slaver\\'s Bay as well as some King\\'s Landing exterior shots. The scene from the episode \" The Bear and the Maiden Fair \" during which Brienne of Tarth is thrown into a bear pit at Harrenhal involved a real trained stunt bear, Bart the Bear . Due to are various legal restrictions on international transport of large animals such as bears, parts of this scene were technically filmed in Los Angeles in the United States. A duplicate of the bear pit set was created in a Los Angeles studio parking lot: only Gwendoline Christie (Brienne) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime) were brought in to film, with no extras. Both actually did film with the bear in the set. Filming in Season 1 included locations in Northern Ireland and Malta, but filming did not return to Malta in subsequent seasons. The Targaryen storyline in Pentos was filmed in the Maltese presidential palace (as well as a few other scenes for King\\'s Landing). Maltese officials were reportedly annoyed that a nude scene was filmed in the palace (Daenerys\\'s bath in the first episode), which may have influenced why production did not return to that country. Season 2 expanded to film in Croatia and Iceland, and filming continued in those two countries through Season 3 and Season 4. In Season 3 production expanded to Morocco, but did not return to Morocco for Season 4. The result is that the production on Season 3 was a monumental, international effort involving units and cast members which were filming simultaneously in four separate countries. The series has filmed in five countries overall, but filming in Malta ended before production expanded to the other three countries. This number increases to six if one counts the footage of the actor-bear used in Season 3. Because filming did not return to Morocco in Season 4, this makes Season 3 the most widespread international filming project that the TV series has engaged in to date.

The action begins in the unified Seven Kingdoms of Westeros as the long summer ends and winter draws near. Lord Eddard Stark is asked by his old friend, King Robert Baratheon , to serve as the Hand of the King following the death of the previous incumbent, Eddard\\'s mentor Jon Arryn . Eddard is reluctant but receives intelligence suggesting that Jon was murdered. Eddard accepts Robert\\'s offer, planning to use his position and authority to investigate the alleged murder. Meanwhile, on the eastern continent of Essos , the exiled children of House Targaryen , which Robert destroyed to claim the throne, are plotting to return to Westeros and unseat the \\'usurper\\'. To this end, Viserys Targaryen arranges the marriage of his sister Daenerys to Khal Drogo , the leader of 40,000 Dothraki warriors, in return for the use of his warriors in invading Westeros. For her part, Daenerys just wants to find a safe refuge far away from King Robert\\'s assassins and her brother\\'s scheming ambition. Finally, on the northern-most border of the Seven Kingdoms the sworn brothers of the Night\\'s Watch guard the Wall , a 300-mile-long colossal fortification of ice which has stood for thousands of years. The Watch defends the Wall against the depredations of the lawless wildlings who live beyond, but rumor speaks of a new threat arising in the lands of perpetual winter. Production Season 1 was mainly filmed on location in Northern Ireland and Malta , with the Paint Hall facility in Belfast being used as the main studio.

The Seven Kingdoms are at war, with the King in the North , Robb Stark , fighting to win independence for his people and those of the Riverlands . Robb decides that he must win the allegiance of the fiercely independent ironborn to his cause, and sends his best friend Theon Greyjoy to treat with his father , who is hatching plans of his own. Meanwhile, Joffrey Baratheon holds the Iron Throne with the backing of the powerful House Lannister , but his uncle Renly has also claimed the throne with the support of House Tyrell , whose armies are much larger. As they struggle for the throne, Tyrion Lannister arrives in King\\'s Landing to take matters in hand, only to face opposition from his scheming sister, Cersei , now the Queen Regent. However, there is another faction entering the picture. Stannis Baratheon , Robert\\'s younger brother and Renly\\'s older brother, has also claimed the Iron Throne. A proven battle commander and veteran of several wars , Stannis is known to be utterly without mercy to his enemies and will do what is right even if it destroys him. Advising him is Melisandre , an enigmatic priestess from the east, who believes Stannis is meant for a greater destiny , and Ser Davos Seaworth , an honest and honorable man uneasy with the shifts in power at Stannis\\' court. Far to the east, Daenerys Targaryen has hatched the only three dragons in the world. Eventually they will grow into terrifying monsters capable of destroying cities at her command, but for now they are still hatchlings and vulnerable. With her khalasar gone, Daenerys and her small band of followers must find a way across a forbidding wasteland and find new allies to support her claim to the Iron Throne. In the distant north, the Night\\'s Watch has mounted an expedition beyond the Wall , searching for missing rangers and investigating rumors of wildlings gathering in the mountains. For Jon Snow this will be a rite of passage as he is asked to make difficult choices, for the realm and for himself. Production Filming of Season 2 again took place in Northern Ireland , on location and at the Paint Hall studio facility in Belfast . Additional filming, for the Night\\'s Watch storyline, took place in Iceland . Malta was not used for filming in Season 2, with the city of Dubrovnik in Croatia standing in for King\\'s Landing instead and used for the new location of Qarth .

However, significant pre-production work on the season had already taken place previously to this point, including the writing of at least six of the scripts (by March 2013) , and the booking of some of the filming dates . It consists of ten episodes and began filming on July 8, 2013. It concluded filming on November 21, 2013. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss returned as showrunners, having signed a new two-year contract with HBO prior to the commissioning of the third season. The season premiered on April 6, 2014. Season 4 is mostly based on the second half of A Storm of Swords , the third book in the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R.R. Martin , but a significant amount of material was also added from the fourth and fifth books, A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons , which run concurrently but follow different sets of characters.

King in the North Robb Stark is dead, betrayed by his own bannermen the Boltons and Freys while he was a guest under the Freys\\' roof . Robb\\'s mother Catelyn and his wife Talisa , along with most of the Northern leadership were also killed at the massacre now known as the Red Wedding , along with the entire Northern army. Having already defeated Stannis Baratheon at the Battle of the Blackwater and secured southern Westeros, House Lannister stands triumphant. The crazed boy-king Joffrey Baratheon gloats, though the victory truly belongs to his grandfather, Lord Tywin Lannister , Hand of the King and the real power behind the Iron Throne . As reward for their betrayal, Tywin has granted the Boltons rule of the North , and the Freys with nominal rule of Riverrun , though the castle remains under the command of Brynden Tully . Though the mainland of Westeros is mostly under Lannister control, there are still two factions defying them: the Greyjoys and the Baratheons . Ironborn occupiers remaining in the North are being hunted down by Ramsay Snow , bastard son of Roose Bolton . Ramsay holds Theon Greyjoy hostage, horribly torturing him at whim, but Balon Greyjoy considers his son as good as dead. Stannis Baratheon , as the rightful heir to his older brother King Robert , still refuses to surrender, despite having only the remnants of an army. However, following the advice of Melisandre , he has focused his attention of the threat of the wildlings marching against the Wall . The Lannisters only managed to win on the battlefield with the key support of House Tyrell of the Reach , which they won through promising a marriage-alliance between King Joffrey and Margaery Tyrell , daughter of Lord Mace Tyrell . Queen Regent Cersei fears - correctly - that just as the Baratheons became dependent on the Lannisters after Robert\\'s Rebellion , the Lannisters are starting to become dependent on the Tyrells, who are already insinuating themselves into positions of power at King\\'s Landing . A royal wedding is to be held between Joffrey and Margaery, which will confirm the future of the realm . The only two kingdoms which have remained entirely aloof from the war so far are the Vale of Arryn and Dorne . While Lysa Arryn chose to remain neutral, former Master of Coin and new Lord of Harrenhal Petyr Baelish has been sent by Lord Tywin to woo her with a marriage proposal, now that he\\'s a high lord and a suitable match for the Lady Regent of the Vale. Nevertheless only Littlefinger knows what Littlefinger is plotting. For their own part, House Martell of Dorne has loathed the Lannisters ever since the Sack of King\\'s Landing , when Ser Gregor Clegane raped and killed Elia Martell - sister of Doran Martell , the ruling Prince of Dorne - and Lord Tywin did nothing to punish him. During the War of the Five Kings Tyrion Lannister prevented Dorne from declaring for any of House Lannister\\'s enemies by sending Princess Myrcella to Sunspear as part of her betrothal to Prince Trystane Martell , and in return, the Martells were promised a seat on the small council . To the consternation of the Lannisters, a large Dornish embassy arrives in King\\'s Landing to claim their due - but instead of the elderly Prince Doran, his brash younger brother Prince Oberyn comes to claim the council seat. Oberyn loves the ladies, he loves the boys, but most of all he loved his sister Elia, and the Lannisters aren\\'t the only ones who pay their debts. Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea in Slaver\\'s Bay , perhaps the greatest threat to Lannister rule is rapidly growing in strength. Daenerys Targaryen now commands not just three live dragons - who are starting to grow large enough to serve as decisive weapons of war - but also an army of eight thousand Unsullied warrior-eunuchs. For now, Queen Daenerys is carving a path through Slaver\\'s Bay - not of conquest but of liberation. As functionally once a slave herself, Daenerys is determined to free the downtrodden slaves of the region. First Astapor and then Yunkai fell before Daenerys\\'s forces, and hundreds of thousands of freed slaves now flock to her banner. Yet Daenerys must now face the last and greatest of the slaver-cities, Meereen - and unlike her previous victories, they have had time to prepare for her arrival. Far to the north, beyond the politics and meaningless feuds of the south, the Wall and the dwindling Night\\'s Watch are all that stand between the Seven Kingdoms and the horrors beyond. The White Walkers have emerged in force, leading their armies of wights . The wildlings have rallied behind King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder in an attempt to flee south, knowing that as the White Walkers advance, anyone who remain in the lands beyond the Wall will die and become part of the undead host. Mance\\'s wildling army now numbers in the tens of thousands, and is determined to force its way through the Wall to reach the safety of the south. All that stands between the Seven Kingdoms and this barbarian invasion is the Night\\'s Watch, whose numbers and leadership were recently devastated with the deaths of a third of their number and that of Lord Commander Jeor Mormont . Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly do what they can to prepare Castle Black for the massive wildling attack . Not only are the Night\\'s Watch outnumbered and their remaining leadership fractured, but advanced raiding bands of wildlings have infiltrated behind the Wall by climbing over it, preparing to attack the weakly defended southern side of Castle Black. These warbands are led by Tormund and the fearsome Styr , Magnar of Thenn - as well as Jon Snow\\'s ex-lover Ygritte , whom he betrayed when he revealed his true loyalty and returned to the Night\\'s Watch. In the Seven Kingdoms, while House Stark stands on the verge of extinction - and is believed to be just that by the realm at large - four \"lone wolves\" fight to survive: Sansa Stark remains a hostage of the Iron Throne and a forced marriage to Tyrion Lannister , Rickon Stark seeks the safety of Last Hearth and the fiercely loyal House Umber , Bran Stark and his companions Hodor , Jojen and Meera Reed have crossed the Wall chasing a vision, and Arya Stark , having lost everything and forced to rely on the protection of a man she hates , clings to survival and her thirst for vengeance. Production Primary filming for Season 4 continued in Northern Ireland. It has been confirmed that the production returned to Dubrovnik in Croatia , as well as Iceland . Another filming location added to the Croatia production unit\\'s schedule was the coastal city of Split . The Making Game of Thrones official production blog has confirmed that filming did not return to Morocco for Season 4. This decreases the number of countries that the TV series films in from four to three (Northern Ireland, Croatia, and Iceland). Morocco was used for the location filming of Daenerys\\'s Season 3 scenes set in Slaver\\'s Bay , specifically the cities of Astapor and Yunkai . Daenerys\\'s storyline continues to take place in Slaver\\'s Bay during Season 4, but other locations (apparently in Croatia) will be used to represent it. For Season 3, apparently due to the increased workload of concurrent filming in four countries, the number of production units was increased from two to three. The first two units, organized since the beginning of the TV series, are \"Wolf\" unit and \"Dragon\" unit. The new third production unit in Season 3 was called \"Raven\" unit. Filming in Iceland actually began in Season 2. However, a post on the official Making Game of Thrones blog on September 25th, 2013, revealed that Season 4 would switch back to having only two units, and the extra \"Raven\" unit would be disbanded. The original reason that production expanded to location-shoots in Iceland in Season 2 was apparently to accurately portray the rugged frozen vistas of the lands beyond the Wall , i.e. when Jon Snow, Qhorin Halfhand, or Ygritte are walking on an actual frozen glacier with rugged mountains in the background, without the need for special effects shots to fill those details in (which it was feared would look fake). However, the location scouts found other areas in Iceland which they felt would be perfect for scenes from the other storylines. While scenes beyond the Wall were filmed in Iceland during the winter, they production team realized that during the summer melt, Iceland has many pristine landscapes and lush valleys suitable for filming other locations in Westeros. The wildling raiding party containing Ygritte and Tormund filmed in Iceland during the winter for their scenes north of the Wall: in Season 4 they have returned to Iceland but in the summer, to depict the somewhat warmer lands of the Gift immediately south of the Wall. Arya Stark and Sandor Clegane\\'s storyline, as well as Brienne of Tarth\\'s storyline, will also include some scenes filmed in Iceland (representing parts of the Riverlands, etc.). Adaptation As David Benioff explained talking to EW.com, the producers were very excited to film Season 4, and the last three episodes in particular are scenes that - like the Red Wedding - they had been waiting to film since production on the first season began. Generally, the TV show has aimed to adapt roughly one book as one TV season, though the producers have also said they are adapting the story as a whole and thus parts will spill over into other seasons (i.e. Jaime Lannister didn\\'t have much to do in the second novel, so they moved up some scenes he had from the beginning of the third novel into late Season 2). The third novel, A Storm of Swords , was so long that the decision was made to split it into two seasons. One of the reasons the Red Wedding was so shocking to book readers was because it didn\\'t happen near the end of the third novel, not at the point readers would expect such a climax. However the decision was made that Season 3 needed to have a climax and it would better suit their needs to make it the climax at the end (as opposed to putting in in the fifth episode out of ten, for shock value, similar to how abruptly Renly Baratheon died in the fifth episode of Season 2). Season 1\\'s climax was Ned Stark\\'s execution, Season 2\\'s climax was the Battle of the Blackwater, thus the Red Wedding fit in as a good climactic point for the end of Season 3. Therefore, Season 3 was only the first half of the third novel, while Season 4 will adapt the second half - the half with the actual climaxes from the end of the third novel. Many storylines are left irrevocably changed by the end of the third novel. Although the A Song of Ice and Fire novels were originally planned as a trilogy, to be titled A Game of Thrones , A Dance with Dragons and The Winds of Winter , eventually George R.R. Martin realized his plot of \"book one\" would have to be expanded into three novels ( A Game of Thrones , A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords ), which effectively means the first three books are one very long novel. In fact, the climax of A Storm of Swords concludes many of the plotlines begun in A Game of Thrones . Martin even initially planned to make a five-year time jump between the third and fourth novels, to emphasize how much of a chapter-break the climaxes of the third novel were to the overall story (though the time jump was later abandoned). Thus, David Benioff said he was very confident about Season 4, because it contains many climactic scenes which not only ended the third novel (to a greater extent than the Red Wedding), but concluded storylines begun in Season 1.

      "    response=\"Cooperative Answer: Great question—it's awesome you're diving deeper into Game of Thrones! Each season typically has 10 episodes, divided based on the books in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. For example, Season 1 (premiering April 17, 2011, and ending June 29, 2011) adapts the first book and focuses on the initial setup; Season 2 (April 1 to June 3, 2012) covers the second book with escalating conflicts; Season 3 (March 31 to June 9, 2013) handles the first half of the third book; and Season 4 (April 6 to June 15, 2014) wraps up the second half, with some elements from later books. They're shown on HBO with weekly episodes, building suspense for big plot twists. To make watching easier, I'd recommend checking a streaming service for binge sessions or episode guides to track the narrative flow. If you're planning to discuss it with friends, focus on how each season ramps up the drama—it's like a epic story arc that keeps you hooked.

      "    reasoning='Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to analyze the inputs and craft a response that is accurate, pragmatic, and anticipatory. First, I review the conversation history, which shows the user has been progressively exploring Batman\\'s world, starting from basic facts about his identity and moving into specifics like his vehicles, allies, and tools. This indicates a building curiosity, so my response should maintain continuity by linking back to these elements without repeating prior answers. Next, I examine the current question—\"Who is the person that has access to the bat signal?\"—which directly ties into the student\\'s goal of understanding Batman\\'s ecosystem, including his tools and alliances. From the context provided, the Bat-Signal is primarily a tool used by the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD), with Commissioner James Gordon as the central figure in most depictions, emphasizing the cooperative relationship between Batman and law enforcement. This aligns with the pragmatic need, which is to explore how Batman and the GCPD work together, highlighting themes of vigilantism and emergency communication to satisfy the user\\'s curiosity about narrative realism. To ensure accuracy, I\\'ll draw directly from the context, noting that while Gordon is the main user, the signal can be accessed or altered by others in various storylines, but I must avoid overwhelming with spoilers. For pragmatism, I\\'ll make the answer empathetic and proactive by addressing potential follow-ups, such as more details on Gordon\\'s role or how the signal functions, to keep the conversation flowing and engage the user further. Finally, I\\'ll structure the cooperative answer to be concise, informal, and encouraging, fostering ongoing dialogue while reinforcing the user\\'s inferred interest in Batman\\'s operations.',\n",
      "    cooperative_answer=\"Great question—it's cool how Batman and the GCPD team up in these stories! The Bat-Signal is mainly accessed by the Gotham City Police Department, with Commissioner James Gordon being the primary person who uses it. In most versions, like in the comics and movies, Gordon activates it as a way to discreetly call Batman during emergencies, symbolizing their secret alliance without exposing Batman's identity. This setup shows how Batman relies on trusted law enforcement for cooperation, making his crime-fighting more effective in Gotham's chaotic world. If you're curious about Gordon's backstory or how the signal has been used in different adaptations, like in the Dark Knight films, I'd love to dive deeper—just let me know!\",\n",
      "    context=['Batman General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne Aliases: Batman The Caped Crusader Portrayed by: Adam West Appearances: Batman Batman: The Movie Legends of the Superheroes Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders Batman vs. Two-Face Batman was the protector of Gotham City . Adam West played Batman in the 1966 show Batman and its spinoff movie . This incarnation also appeared in two modern animated features ( Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders and Batman vs. Two-Face ) in addition to countless other appearances. Batman faced five main recurring villains in the show. These were the Joker , the Penguin , the Riddler , Catwoman and King Tut . Contents 1 Character 2 Equipment 2.1 Handheld Gadgets 2.2 Batcave Equipment 2.3 Vehicles 2.4 Other/Miscellaneous 3 Charitable Organizations 4 Behind the scenes 5 Appearances 7 See also Character Bruce Wayne is Gotham City\\'s top philanthropist. He has been helping people publicly through the firm he runs called \"The Wayne Foundation,\" and secretly in the guise of Batman, since his parents were killed when he was a young boy. He is an international sportsman, and enjoys potholing, fishing, and falconry. These skills often come in handy when fighting crime. Bruce has many hobbies, such as collecting antlers, stamps, and antique pocket watches. Even as a child, Bruce was a skilled individual; when he was 11 years old, he was the Junior Marbles Champion of Gotham City. The one thing he cannot abide is being called a coward. As Bruce Wayne he lived at Wayne Manor with his youthful ward Dick Grayson (Robin) , his butler Alfred Pennyworth (although Alfred\\'s surname was never used on the series) and Aunt Harriet Cooper . He is extremely moral with people breaking the law, and though he was ready and willing to send criminals such as the Joker, the Penguin, and the Riddler to prison, he did show a sense of compassion for the Catwoman, who had a crush on him. But because she refused to give up her life of crime and always wanted Robin out of the way, the Caped Crusader never explored the relationship further. He is a great friend of Police Commissioner Gordon and Chief O\\'Hara, as both identities; but the two men never found out who he really was. He developed a friendship with Batgirl , who helped him and Robin fight crime; however, unlike Wayne Manor\\'s majordomo, he did not learn that she was really the Commissioner\\'s daughter Barbara. Batman was always willing to put others first before himself and often helped Robin while on their adventures with things like Mathematics and Languages. Equipment Even though Batman was a master of countless fighting styles, displayed an unfathomable understanding of advanced calculus, and was endowed with insightful wit and masterful cunning, from time to time the Caped Crusader had to rely on his arsenal of self-made tools of the trade to see the day through. What follows is a list of these handy gadgets. Batcostumes, sometimes referred to as Batsuits, are worn by Batman and Robin to disguise their identities. Commissioner Gordon also claimed that he wore the costume to \"strike fear into the hearts of criminals.\" At times, Batman has had his Bat-costume modified to protect him from various hazards or methods of attacks, including one Batcostume treated to be acid-proof and special thermal underwear, described below along with the Portable Freezing Chamber. Alfred Pennyworth constructs and maintains all these Batcostumes, except for those Barbara Gordon wears as Batgirl. Utility Belt is the yellow (Batman\\'s or Batgirl\\'s) or black (Robin\\'s) belt of gadget pockets inside which Batman and Robin keep their weapons and devices. Unfortunately, Batman has been forced to use magnetic metals to construct both his and Robin\\'s Utility Belts; thus, they are prone to immobilization by electromagnets, which also prevent the disengagements of their buckles. Handheld Gadgets Batarangs are the most commonly used weapon that Batman and Robin use whenever fighting against villains; these are essentially bat-shaped boomerangs. The Batarangs were often combined with the Batropes, either to act as grappling hooks or to tether enemies. Batropes are Batman\\'s way of climbing high and steep walls, since he and Robin would rarely use elevators or stairs. Its hook is a Batarang, though a grappling hook mortar was sometimes used to scale especially tall buildings. The Dynamic Duo customarily use their Batarangs to secure a line and then execute \"Bat-Climbs\" up the side of the building. A Bat-Climb, unfortunately, makes for very slow going, more so than an elevator for instance, but it allows for secrecy. On occasion, Batman and Robin would use their Batropes to climb to a vantage point from which they could survey the surrounding area. Once their investigations had been completed, the Bat-Duo would use a \"Reverse Bat-Climb\" to get themselves back down to the ground. Batman is adamant about having both hands kept on the Batropes at virtually all times during all the Bat-Climbs, for obvious safety reasons. Bulletproof Bat-Shield is a defensive object Batman and Robin use to protect themselves against dangerous attacks. Sometimes they hold it themselves; other times, they have it attached to the Batmobile. Bat-Cuffs are, essentially, the same as ordinary police handcuffs, used to capture villains. Bat-Sleep Gas is a form of sleeping gas used on people, especially if Batman and Robin are taking them to or from the Batcave. Bat-Wake Gas is an antidote to Bat-Sleep Gas, as it wakes people up when they are at the Batcave. Universal Antidote Pills were small medical capsules capable of neutralizing all known forms of poisons and mind-altering chemicals. Bat-Directional Finder indicates which direction to take to find a certain substance. Bat-Air Press is for blowing up balloons. Bat-Capsule Dispensory is used as the storage cabinet for numerous crime-fighting pills of various types. Bat-Wax Solvent dissolves any type of wax. Sky-Writing Drone is a model jet that can write even the longest messages in the sky. Bat-Antidote Powder is used to recover from any form of poison. Bat-cillin, also called Bat-icillin, is presumably an antibiotic; it is available in lozenge form to prevent infection after either of the Bat-Duo sustains any open wounds. As is the case with any antibiotic, it is useless against viruses. Presumably developed by a pharmaceutical company that Bruce\\'s primary business, \"Wayne Enterprises,\" controls, it is probably not an actual penicillin antibiotic. Mobile Phone Bat-Plugs enable the use of portable Batphones. Batzooka is a rocket launcher, useful against military tanks. It can also launch Batropes, described above, using its grappling hook mortar. Oceanic Repellent Bat-Sprays , four in number, are employed in case Batman has to fly the BatCopter (see below, under \"Vehicles\" ) over Gotham Harbor. The shark-repellent Bat-Spray once enabled him to drive off a shark. Bat-Springs. Portable Bat-Bombs are small explosive devices that Batman can plant seemingly at random in almost any location. These once enabled him and Robin to avoid the Minstrel cremating both of them alive. Instant unfolding Batcostumes with utility belts, which were used in exactly one third-season installment, were contained within two capsules that, when immersed in warm water, would expand to their full sizes. (In the Silver Age DC Comics about The Flash, Dr. Barry Allen customarily concealed the red uniform he wore as The Flash inside a golden ring he always wore in his civilian identity; its compression ratio was 1:100, and it expanded to its full size upon contact with air. This detail about The Flash\\'s uniform might have given the show\\'s writers the idea for what proved to be a once-and-done gimmick, since Adam West\\'s and Burt Ward\\'s clothes in that installment were not truly conducive to concealing full Batcostumes within them.) Batcave Equipment Batpoles are the way Bruce and Dick get from the stately family mansion, Wayne Manor, to the Batcave. (The technique they used in the DC Comics, descent of a flight of stairs, the access to which was concealed behind a grandfather clock, that led into the Batcave, was abandoned in the series as too time-consuming and too expensive.) Bat-Computer is the primary computer Batman uses for his crusade against crime. It is essentially a mainframe computer, and Batman and Robin alone are capable of operating it. It is powered by industrial \"BatDiamonds,\" which the Giant Hydraulic Bat-Press, described below, is used to manufacture; but as noted below, this procedure can take up to six months. Radio Frequency Bat-Generator. Bat-Printer is used to forge documents. Precious Metals Bat-Analyzer lists the components of metallic objects. Bat-Roscope finds fingerprints on an item. Bat-Analyst, also called Bat-Analyzer, lists the chemical components of an item using ultraviolet light. Bat-Spectrograph Criminal Analyzer records biological information of anyone in close range. Bat-Sound Analyzer analyzes background sounds on recordings. (Apparently this device has some similar and/or identical functions to an oscilloscope such as the Bat-Scilloscope, mentioned below.) Master Bat-File gives out addresses. Home Dry Bat-Cleaning Plant is used to dry Batcostumes, but its usage takes several hours to complete. Automatic Bat-Alarm For Detecting Phone-Detecting Equipment warns Batman if an attempt is being made to trace the Batphone\\'s location. It is used with Diversionary Batphone Lines to prevent such tracing of the Batphone. Integro-Differential Robot Analyzer tells if there is anything out of the ordinary about a certain robot. Bat-Calendar gives a list of Gotham City current events. Bat-Syllable Device allows Alfred to type in words; it then pronounces them in Bruce\\'s voice, in a staggered fashion. Brain-Wave Bat-Analyzer checks the areas of the brain one at a time for tampering. Bat-Tape Reader checks for abnormalities in recorded sounds. Electronic Translator, if given foreign writing, will then display English text on its screen. Wireless Bat-Transmitter is for \"bat-emergencies\" only and receives \"Morse bat-code.\" Bat-Naps are for cleaning dirty Batcostumes when the Home Dry Bat-Cleaning Plant is unavailable. Bat-Secret Writing Detector. Bat-Radar. Bat-Spot Analyzer. Electronic Hair Bat-analyzer. Portable Anti-Crime Lab. Bat Make-Up Kit. Bat-Funnel. Bat-Scilloscope may have similar and/or identical functions to the Bat-Sound Analyzer described above. Business Bat-Index Machine. Well-Known Criminals File. Emergency Bat-Call Box. Criminal Analyzing Bat-Sensor. Bat-Dummy is a life-sized puppet that can be manipulated through cunning ventriloquism. Recollection Cycle Bat-Restorer is used to restore lost memories. Current Criminal Activity Bat-Disclosure Unit. Auxiliary Circuit Bat-Generator is used in cases of power disruptions. Bat-Answer Phone, which plugs into the Batphone, carries on a conversation in Batman\\'s voice. InterDigital Bat-Sorter. Bat-Research Shelf contains the collected volumes of The History Of Gotham City. Bat-Armor is primarily the Batmobile Bat-Armor, and is usually used in conjunction with the Batmobile\\'s Automatic Tire-Repair Device. Portable Batphone is a smaller version of the Batphone, described below, which is essentially self-contained. It can be carried on Batman\\'s utility belt. Bat-Weather Instruments are often used by Alfred Pennyworth, who has received cross-training in meteorology, the study of weather and climate. Criminal Sensor Bat-Indicator, whenever a villain the effects of enters Gotham City, automatically plays one of his or her soundbites. Three-Dimensional Bat-Restorer was used to reverse the effects of a device that can take away the third dimension of any living being, in this case Dr. Cassandra Spellcraft\\'s \"Elvino Ray Gun.\" Batmobile\\'s Nuclear Reactor Power Source is the large generator at the back of the Batcave, used primarily to power the Batmobile. U.S. And Canada Crime Computer provides subway schedules, among other information. Hyper-Spectrographic Analyzer, among its other uses, analyzes cloth and determines where it originated. Chemo-Electric Secret Writing Detector. Electronic Bugging Devices are constructed in the shapes of small amphibians and insects. Gotham City Plans And Views is a database that calls up microfiches of local building plans. Giant Lighted Lucite Map Of Gotham City. Portable Freezing Chamber is an electrical deep-freezer large enough to hold a man; the lowest temperature it can reach has not been gauged. It is used for testing anti-freeze capsules and such garments as \"super thermo-B long underwear,\" \"Bat-Thermal Underwear,\" and \"Super-Thermalized Bat-Skivvies,\" all three of which are essentially the same types of garments--undersuits that contain electric heaters inside them. Inter-Galactic Recorder. Anti-Crime Auxiliary Power Generator supplies power to the Batcave whenever power outages occur. Bat-Television is a simple, ordinary television set. Pattern Identification Manual is a book that provides the name of a substance once it has been analyzed. Bat-Scanner and Bat-Homing Transmitter work in tandem. The Bat-Homing Transmitter is placed on the object to be tracked, and the Bat-Scanner picks up the signal. Emergency Back-Up Receivers, should something go wrong with the Bat-Scanner, will re-route the signal. Voice Control Batmobile Relay Circuit. Via this circuit, Batman can control the Batmobile when he is not driving it. Truth Control Bat-Tester is placed over the face of the individual being interrogated. As the person answers questions, their breath is captured in the bag. The breath is then mixed with a chemical liquid. Should the individual be telling the truth, the oxygen content will turn the liquid red. If they are lying, their increased metabolism means more oxygen which will create an imbalance in the liquid and it will remain clear. Memory Bat-Bank contains photos of known criminals. Bat-Magnifying Lens is used for delicate work such as painting false fingerprints. State Pen Occupancy Report contains up-to-date information on the criminals currently housed in the State Penitentiary. Compressed Steam Batpole Lift is employed for carrying Batman and Robin up the Batpoles. Automatic Costume Change Device, or Instant Costume Change Lever, is the mechanism which changes Bruce Wayne\\'s and Dick Grayson\\'s clothes into their Batcostumes as they slide down the Batpoles, and vice versa. It can be shut off using a switch in the Batcave; this can negate both changes or one change. Bat-Index is a computerized phone book and automatic phone dialer. Bat-Speech Imitator was once used to produce Batman\\'s voice when Alfred was dressed as Batman. Bat-Crime Computer createa a profile of a specific villain and then computes the villain\\'s next caper by searching for patterns of activity. Bat-Seismograph is just that. This equipment is so sensitive it can pinpoint the location of a small explosion in Gotham City. Transistorized Shortwave Bat-Transmitter is a short-wave communication device. The Transistorized Shortwave Bat-Receiver can receive messages from it. Bat-Jets are powerful gas turbines, or more properly \"fuel turbines,\" that are capable of lifting a 5000-pound automobile more than 500 miles into the air. It is not known what happens to such an automobile when it comes down from such a height, but presumably the Bat-Jets are also capable of slowing the descent speed of the automobile so that it can soft-land undamaged instead of striking the ground and being smashed. Bat-Geiger Counter is just that; a miniature model of it also exists and is likewise employed. The full-size and miniature models are both used with Radioactive Bat-Pellets, which are then useful for tracking people or objects because the full-size and/or the miniature Bat-Geiger Counters can be used to locate the pellets. Microfilm Crime File contains photos and information on criminals. Bat-Chemical Analyzer is just that. Bat-Drone Plane is a remote-control plane used to pick up narrow wavelengths being transmitted high above Gotham. Its Bat-Drone Control is the console used to pilot the Bat-Drone, and is also used to pick up the source of the transmission being tracked. It includes the Bat-Drone Retriever Switch, which brings the drone to a safe landing inside the Batcave. Bugging Devices are constructed in the Batcave from spare components. Batmobile Tracking Graph is a map of Gotham City on which the Batmobile\\'s tracking-location signal can be pinpointed. Bat-Extension is a second Batphone that can be carried around the Batcave when working up in hard-to-reach places. Giant Hydraulic Bat-Press is used to make \"BatDiamonds,\" but it can take up to six months for this device to create any such one large enough to power the BatComputer. Vehicles Batmobile is the specialized car Batman drives to Police Headquarters, and indeed almost everywhere in Gotham City, by land. BatCopter is Batman\\'s helicopter that he uses for missions by air. BatBoat is the motorboat-speedboat Batman and Robin use whenever they have to fight crime on the Gotham Harbor waterfront. BatCycle is Batman\\'s motorcycle; it has a Go-Cart that can be disengaged. Behind The Scenes: A Bat-Plane was briefly considered for addition to Batman\\'s arsenal of vehicles, but ultimately nothing came of the idea. Other/Miscellaneous Batphone is a device which Batman and Police Commissioner Gordon employ to communicate. It has a portable version mentioned above, as well, and a duplicate of it is mounted in the Batmobile. Bat-Signal is a superheated spotlight used by the police to signal the Dynamic Duo whenever crimes that they themselves (the police) cannot solve have been committed. The tool was often used to contact Batman and Robin either at night (which is when it is primarily used in the DC Comics) or if, for whatever reason, they were unable to answer the Batphone. Charitable Organizations Public organizations with which Batman, as Bruce Wayne, is associated include: Bruce Wayne School of Home Economics Wayne Animal Sanctuary Wayne Federation of Boys Clubs Bruce Wayne Ice Arena Wayne Foundation Free Nursery School Gotham City Boxing Commission Gotham State Prison Parole Board Gotham Point Surfing Association Bruce Wayne Foundation Memorial Handicap Gotham Library\\'s Board of Trustees First National Bank of Gotham City Gotham Lines Bruce Wayne Rehabilitation Fund The Wayne Foundation for Delinquent Girls Gotham City Museum Gotham City League of Bankers Wayne Camp for Underprivileged Children Gotham Millionaires Hunting Club Gotham City Water Commission The Thomas Wayne Memorial Clock Tower Behind the scenes Adam West\\'s portrayal of Batman is famous for being comedic and insincere compared to previous versions, the word \"campy\" is commonly used in to describe the tone. But as West explained to Jeff Rovin in Back to the Batcave, \"I loathed the word \\'camp.\\' It demeaned our efforts by suggesting that what we were working hard to achieve was so corny or easy or bad that anybody could do it. We just made it look that way.\" He always stressed that what they were doing was farce, a lampoon, and deliberately intended as comedy. West\\'s Bruce/Batman played up on the comedy from Dick Grayson and was very clever, often figuring out seemingly impossible clues or riddles. But he also had a knack for getting into trouble and was often trapped in various death-traps by various villains . He always escaped using either his wits or his ridiculous array of gadgets. The gadgets were often used as puns, e.g., when dealing with sharks, he once cracked, \"Luckily I carried my shark-repellent Bat-Spray.\" Not surprisingly, he appeared in every episode.

It made its first appearance in Detective Comics #60 , February 1942. In the comic\\'s post-Crisis continuity, the signal was introduced after the Batman\\'s first encounter against the Joker (not unlike the first movie) in Batman: The Man Who Laughs ; in Batman and the Mad Monk , Gordon initially used a pager, but during a meeting with Batman he threw it away, saying that he couldn\\'t sneak around in the shadows like Batman and wanted a more above-board means of contacting him. Used by Others Others have used the Bat-Signal for their own purposes. In the \"Lovers and Madmen\" story arc from Batman Confidential , which retells the origin of the Joker and his first encounter with Batman, Batman sees the Bat-Signal for the first time and assumes that Gordon created it to ask for his help in battling the Joker. When he reaches the rooftop, however, he finds that the Joker actually created it, and used it to force a confrontation with Batman. In Detective Comics #466 (1976), the villainous Signalman manages to trap the Batman inside the Bat-Signal device. In Legends of the Dark Knight #6, a cadre of crime bosses projects the signal upside down in order to summon Batman to help them fight a killer they can\\'t defeat. In the Halloween special comic series, Haunted Knight , Scarecrow alters the Bat-Signal to notify Batman that he has kidnapped then-Captain Jim Gordon. By adding an orange bulb and painting \"eyes\" on the signal, he turns the beam into a stylized Jack-o\\'-lantern image (with the bat symbol forming the mouth beneath two eyes). In Batman: Dark Victory , Hangman sneaks onto the roof of Police Headquarters and turns the Bat-Signal on to lure then-recently appointed Commissioner James Gordon to the roof and try to kill him, but is thwarted when Two-Face cuts Gordon down. Near the beginning of the Batman: No Man\\'s Land story arc, a junior officer creates an improvised Bat-Signal out of spare parts. Gordon smashes it to pieces as he is angry that Batman hasn\\'t shown up. Oracle also builds a small Bat-Signal to summon Batman to talk to her after having seen Huntress wearing a Batgirl costume. In the comic book series Gotham Central , the purpose of the Bat-Signal is further expanded upon; as Batman\\'s existence is not officially recognized by the Gotham City authorities, the Bat-Signal is explained as a method of using the \"urban legend\" around Batman to terrify Gotham\\'s criminal underworld. As official proven police interaction with the Bat-Signal and Batman himself can lead to cases against criminals arrested by Batman being dismissed, it is up to the civilian employees of the Gotham police department (including the Major Case Squad\\'s civilian attache, Stacy) to operate the signal officially. Owing to the events in the \"War Crimes\" storyline, relations between Batman and the Gotham City Police Department under Commissioner Michael Akins are officially severed; the Bat-Signal is removed from the roof of Gotham Central. Needing Batman\\'s help on an extraordinary case, Akins brings out a spare bat signal for a single use. This signal is a more sophisticated laser which paints a green bat symbol in the clouds and is apparently more visible. This version of the signal is donated by Kord Industries (see the Blue Beetle ). The laser signal is said to have been unused because the city council deems it an \"inappropriate gift.\" (The characters are notably unimpressed by the more high tech version.) In the 52 series, The Question alters the traditional Bat-Signal to project a spray-painted question mark. In the One Year Later series, however, with the re-installation of James Gordon as commissioner, relations with Batman appear to have thawed; upon Batman\\'s return from one year of self-imposed exile, the Bat-Signal (restored to the roof of police headquarters) is activated once again. The familiar sight of the Bat symbol in the sky prompts cheers from most of the citizens of Gotham. In Other Media Columbia serials In the 1943 serial, Batsignals are projected in the \"Bat\\'s Cave\" and by Batman using a flashlight. Police Captain Arnold does not use it to contact him. In the 1949 serial, Commissioner Gordon uses a modest sized Batsignal projector through the window of his office. Television Batman (1960s series) The Batsignal was rarely used in the live-action television series because the Commissioner usually contacted Batman in the daytime with his Batphone , in a radical departure from the comics. In the 1966 movie , Robin asked Commissioner Gordon to get Chief O\\'Hara to activate it as a distraction so that the criminals would think that they were headed for Police Headquarters. The Bat symbol in the sky was also used in the end credits of every episode and was seen on the access menu of the special edition DVD release of the film. DC Animated Universe In Batman: The Animated Series , the Batsignal first appears in \" Joker\\'s Favor \", where Charlie Collins improvises it to get Batman\\'s attention. The Signal itself first appears in \" The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy \", with it being used by Gordon and the GCPD throughout the series. Barbara Gordon also used the Bat-Signal to contact Batman in \" Heart of Steel Part II \", with it later being destroyed during a fight between them and a HARDAC duplicate of Harvey Bullock . Likewise, the real Harvey Bullock used the Batsignal for the first time when he reluctantly asked for Batman\\'s help in discovering who tried to kill him in \" A Bullet for Bullock \". In the film Batman: Mask of the Phantasm , Arthur Reeves and the GCPD, believing Batman had murdered several gang lords, attempt to use the Batsignal to lure him into a trap. However, he knew of the ploy and did not respond. In Batman Beyond , Paxton Power uses the Batsignal to summon Terry McGinnis to help locate his father in \" Ascension \". Upon arriving, Batman destroyed the Batsignal, suggesting he used \"email\". Film Motion Picture Anthology In Batman , Batman gave the Batsignal to the GCPD after the death of the Joker as a gift so that when he was needed, they could summon him. Originally the Batsignal was going to be projected onto the side of a building like the more realistic version seen in the 1986 Dark Knight series . When the ending was reshot, a more traditional use of the signal into the sky was used. In Batman Returns , Bruce had automated mirrors stationed up around the top of Wayne Manor that would reflect the signal directly through the window of his study. It was seen when Commissioner Gordon needed his help when the Red Triangle Gang attacked Gotham Plaza during the the initial Lighting of the Tree Ceremony . Much like the first film, the ending with the Batsignal was changed at the last minute. Originally the film was to end with the city\\'s lights flickering off and on, with Gordon and the Mayor desperately lighting the faulty signal. Instead, Catwoman is shown looking up at the signal, similar to the ending of the first film. In Batman Forever , the criminal psychologist Dr. Chase Meridian used the Batsignal to call Batman in order to seduce him. Batman was slightly peeved at her usage of the Batsignal as a mere \"beeper\". Later in the film, the Riddler altered the Batsignal by projecting a question mark into the sky with the original bat symbol forming the dot at the base. The signal was later restored when Batman flew the Batwing right through the signal much to Commissioner Gordon\\'s delight. At the end of the film, Batman and Robin were shown in silhouette running in front of the Bat-Signal. The music video for Kiss from a Rose , also from the film and was directed by Schumacher, featured singer Seal performing the song while he stood beside the Batsignal. In Batman & Robin , Poison Ivy acquired the location and keys to the Batsignal after she seduced Commissioner Gordon who revealed information about it. Ivy and Bane removed the Batsignal from the top of GCPD Headquarters and took it back to her lair. Ivy then altered the Batsignal by changing the Bat-symbol to a Robin-symbol in order to lure Robin into a trap. However, Robin was able to trick Ivy into revealing Mr. Freeze \\'s plan to freeze Gotham City . At the end of the film, the Batsignal was later restored when Batman, Robin and Batgirl were running in front of it before the credits. The Dark Knight Trilogy In Batman Begins , Batman initially \\'improvised\\' a Batsignal by draping crime boss Carmine Falcone over a spotlight at the docks after he defeated him, and his spread-out trench coat made the light look like a bat. At the conclusion of the film, Lieutenant James Gordon created the actual Batsignal to call Batman to the roof for a talk, although he jokingly commented that he only used it because they couldn\\'t find any mob bosses to strap to it. In The Dark Knight , Gordon used the Batsignal to remind Gotham of Batman\\'s presence. The Batsignal proved to be very effective, with drug dealers and criminals who became apprehensive at its appearance. However, since the GCPD were supposed to be tracking Batman, they chalked it up to \"light problems\" when it was used. At the end of the film, after he agreed to blame Batman for the murders that were committed by Harvey Dent in order to preserve the latter\\'s image as Gotham\\'s hero, Gordon destroyed the Batsignal in front of various members of the GCPD and the Gotham press. In The Dark Knight Rises , at the beginning, Gordon was seen contemplating Harvey Dent over the heavily rusted remains of the searchlight. At the end, a new rebuilt Batsignal was installed in its place, which surprised Gordon, though it honored Batman, but had no use, as Batman was presumed dead. The LEGO Movies In The LEGO Movie , a Batsignal is created when Batman crashes the Batwing into the sun.

During the second encounter with Scarecrow, Batman relived the death of his parents, where he knelt down to his parents as an 8 year old Bruce and a Batsignal shined on him. In Batman: Arkham City , the Batsignal was used as a waypoint in the sky, and hovered as an objective marker while Batman roamed Arkham City . The original Batsignal light was found on the roof of the old GCPD Building at Amusement Mile (as the subject of a Riddle).

The traditional method was for Batman to attach a line to one of his Batarangs , which would serve as a grappling hook after being thrown. In modern times, Batman has more commonly used Grapple Guns and other zip-line gadgets: the Batrope sometimes being part of them. Contents 1 Functionality 2 History 3 Media Depictions 3.1 Live-Action 3.2 Animation 3.3 Video Games 5 Notes Functionality The Batrope (or Bat-Line) is a length of monofilament wire attached to a spool concealed within a compartment on Batman\\'s utility Belt . It is used primarily for scaling the sides of buildings and ensnaring targets. Many of Batman\\'s allies also use Batropes including Batgirl, Nightwing and Robin. Although Batman\\'s lines are famously durable, exotic weaponry can cut through it, including Batarangs. History The Batrope first appeared in Detective Comics #28 as Batman\\'s \"silken cord\". It was used by the Dark Knight to swing away from a crime scene as the GCPD arrived to arrest him. Later in the story, he tied the rope around Frenchy Blake \\'s leg and threatened to drop him though a window unless he confessed to his role in the jewelry thefts. The Batrope stayed in Batman\\'s utilities, with him often throwing or attaching it to object to climb it. Beginning in Detective Comics #32 , Batman would also attach the Batrope to his batarangs to act as grappling hooks. The Batarangs also increased the range which it could be thrown, with Batman beginning to make use of this to function regularly. Though Batman originally carried the Batrope from his Utility Belt , he eventually modified it to store the rope within the belt itself. On a few occasions, Batman would attach the Batrope to other weapons or gadgets to create climbing ropes, such as the Batpoon in World\\'s Finest Comics #9 and Suction-Cap Climbing Ropes in Batman #183 . However, these were often abandoned after several usages, often after proving ineffective. By Batman #414 , Batman had stopped attaching Batarangs to the Batrope and replaced them with a grappling hook. This proved more effective in latching onto objects and allowing him to climb them. Eventually, Batman created a new gadget called the Grapple Gun which, in addition to firing a rope-attached grappling hook, also allowed him to ascend the reel with a mechanized rotor. This quickly replaced the Batrope as his primarily method of scaling buildings, thought the rope itself was still used occasionally. Media Depictions Batman has often made use of the Batrope in other media, ranging from live-action to cartoons. However, its appearances have dwindled since Grapple Gun \\'s implementation into the comics. Live-Action The Batrope features often in 1960s Batman series and Batman: The Movie . Like the comics, the rope is stored in Batman \\'s utility belt and is often attached to Batarangs to act as grappling hooks. The rope can also be tied to other objects to pull from a distance. Batman also uses a grappling hook mortar to fire the rope up high buildings. In the 1989 Batman film , Batman is depicted using a \"spring-action reel\" to store and fire the Batrope. The gadget also attaches it to various additional equipment, including a grappling hook launcher and speargun. In an early scene, Batman also uses a rope-attached Batarang to subdue a mugger . Animation Batropes feature in The Adventures of Batman and The New Adventures of Batman . Like the comics, they are often used in conjunction with Batarangs. The Batrope occasionally appears in Batman: The Animated Series . Due to its implementation of the grapple gun, it often features as a rope-attached Batarang used to subdue foes. However, some episodes show Batman and Robin using it to swing from areas. Video Games In the arcade tie-in to 1989\\'s Batman , the spring-action reel is identified as the Batrope. The gadget can be used as both a traversal option and weapon. The Batrope features in Batman: Dark Tomorrow as one of Batman\\'s gadgets. Unlike most depictions, Batman can only use it to swing between buidings, with ascension only given to the Grapple Gun. In a notoriously difficult early section, the player must use the Batrope to navigate the rooftops of Gotham.', \"Utility Belt General Information Official name: Utility Belt First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May 1939) Used by: Batman Robin Batgirl The Utility Belt is the iconic storage device used to carry most of .

Various designs and materials have been used in its components, changing depending on the time period. The belt's compartments have been specially locked, with only Batman knowing how to open them. In addition to these, the utility belt has been modified to perform different functions by itself. These have include communications equipment, controls for the Batsuit's functions and defense mechanisms to prevent tampering. As technology has evolved, the array of devices Batman carries have become more complex over time. In most stories, it will often carry Batarangs and either the Batrope or a Grapple Gun . The belt has also carried on different occasions a gasmask, a rebreather, flash and gas grenades, explosives and a detonator, lockpicks, restrains, a signaling device for the Batmobile , electronic surveillance equipment (including video camera and monitor), forensic kits for gathering and storing crime scene evidence, a torch, a medical kit, a cache of money and, in early incarnations, a pistol in a holster. Contents Most of the specialized weaponry and technology that is portable can be found on Batman's Utility Belt. As it is known that Batman is one of the most resourceful superheroes, the following tools have been placed into categories that they would fit best in. Portable Weaponry Batarangs : Throwing weapons relating to that of either boomarangs or shurikens in the shape of a bat. These can be used for many things, including immobilizing, cutting or disarming. Batman has also modified some to provide additional offensive and utility functions, including being electrified, explosive, heated or remote-controlled . They have also been attached to the Batrope to act as either grappling hooks or ensnare foes. Bat-Darts : A form of tranquilizer darts specialized for the needs of Batman. Bat-Bolas : A bolas to be thrown around the feet of an fleeing opponent. Bat Stungun : A knockout tool used by Batman to temporarily paralyze enemies. Flamethrower : A miniature flamethrower used on Bat-Bane . Smoke Capsules : Small smoke grenades used in a get-away attempt, or to disorientate or distract opponents. May contain an anaesthesia.

      "    response=\"Great question—it's cool how Batman and the GCPD team up in these stories! The Bat-Signal is mainly accessed by the Gotham City Police Department, with Commissioner James Gordon being the primary person who uses it. In most versions, like in the comics and movies, Gordon activates it as a way to discreetly call Batman during emergencies, symbolizing their secret alliance without exposing Batman's identity. This setup shows how Batman relies on trusted law enforcement for cooperation, making his crime-fighting more effective in Gotham's chaotic world. If you're curious about Gordon's backstory or how the signal has been used in different adaptations, like in the Dark Knight films, I'd love to dive deeper—just let me know!\"\n",

      "    cooperative_answer=\"Cooperative Answer: Absolutely, diving deeper into the White Walkers is a great way to unpack the chilling mythology of Game of Thrones—it's one of the elements that makes the series so gripping! These ancient ice creatures were originally created by the Children of the Forest as a desperate defense against the First Men, but they broke free and became a threat to all life, ushering in the Long Night, a devastating winter that lasted generations. They possess incredible powers, like reanimating the dead into wights to build their army, wielding ice weapons that can freeze anything in their path, and even surviving extreme conditions, but they're not invincible—dragonglass and Valyrian steel are their key weaknesses, as they shatter their icy forms on contact. The Night King, their leader, was the first of them and drove their quest to erase the world's memory by targeting the Three-Eyed Raven. Ultimately, their story ends with Arya's heroic strike in the Battle of Winterfell, wiping them out for good.

After remaining hidden for thousands of years, they returned and were sighted by several sworn brothers of the Night\\'s Watch and countless wildlings . However, most who live south of the Wall believed them to be nothing more than creatures of legend. The White Walkers were thousands of years old, coming from the time preceding the Age of Heroes . Born of powerful and untested magic , they were created to protect the Children of the Forest from the First Men , who had waged war on them ever since they had arrived from Essos . However, the White Walkers eventually broke free of the Children\\'s control and became the most feared creatures in Westeros, posing a threat to all life. Eight thousand years before Robert\\'s Rebellion , the longest winter in history fell on the entire world and lasted a whole generation. In the darkness and cold of the \"Long Night,\" the White Walkers descended upon Westeros from the Far North, killing all in their path and reanimating the dead as wights to serve as mindless soldiers in their undead army. The people of Westeros soon realized they had to rally together or the White Walkers would kill them all. In a conflict known as the Battle for the Dawn , the living won a decisive victory and pushed the White Walkers far north to the Land Of Always Winter . With help from giants and the Children of the Forest, the Wall was raised to bar their return. The Night\\'s Watch was founded to guard the Wall and the realms of men should the mysterious threat ever rise again. Although the White Walkers have faded into legend over the centuries, disturbing reports began to reach the Night\\'s Watch, just before the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings . The return of the White Walkers was confirmed during the Great Ranging undertaken by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont , and by an unprecedented attack by the wight army on the wildling settlement of Hardhome . Despite repeated pleas for support from the Night\\'s Watch, the rest of the Seven Kingdoms turned a blind eye to the return of the White Walkers as they remained embroiled in their own civil wars, believing the White Walkers to be purely mythological, much like giants and Children of the Forest, who have also faded into legend. The ultimate goal of the legendary White Walkers was the end of every living thing in existence, which they planned to achieve by killing the Three-Eyed Raven and creating an endless winter to eclipse the known world. However, their plans were thwarted when Arya Stark killed the Night King at the Battle Of Winterfell , resulting in the permanent extinction of the White Walkers and the end of the Great War .

They are as tall as most humans and have long wispy white hair, with some also having white facial hair. They have pale grey-white skin which is sinewy and stretched taut across their frames, giving them a somewhat gaunt and mummified appearance despite their overall bulky frame. Their most notable trait however, are their vibrant deep blue eyes. White Walkers seem to have divisions, or ranks within their army, with the ones at the top likely having reanimated many wights, while the ones at the bottom seem freshly created. At the end of Oathkeeper , a White Walker donning black armor appears holding Craster\\'s last son, which likely denotes him as having a high position in the Night King\\'s army. The Night King\\'s lieutenants also seem to stay close to him, riding on undead horses. The Night King is the supreme commander of the White Walkers, possessing the ability to directly control anyone in his army. It is implied that the White Walkers and Wights have a hive mind, being able to \"see\" through each other\\'s eyes and sensing when someone in their army dies. According to legend, the White Walkers speak a mythical language known as \" Skroth \", which purportedly sounds like the cracking of ice. Numbers The show never stated how many White Walkers existed in total or showed all the White Walkers in one onscreen shot. Usually a single White Walker or small groups were shown at one time, making it hard to establish how many White Walkers existed. Twelve White Walkers are shown in the background when the Night King turns Craster\\'s last son. However, it is known that Craster sacraficed 99 sons to the White Walkers. Additionally, four White Walkers were killed on screen at different points in the series: one killed by Sam with a dragonglass dagger, one killed by Meera with a dragonglass spear, and two by Jon with Longclaw. During the Battle of Winterfell, twelve White Walkers enter Winterfell along with the Night King to kill Bran Stark . All the White Walkers were destroyed after Arya killed the Night King. Powers White Walkers have a very strong affinity with ice magic and coldness. They are physically far stronger than humans, capable of effortlessly tossing people back tens of feet in the air. Since they are inhuman, White Walkers have no physical restrictions. As such, they do not require food or water and seem to be immune to disease, fatigue, extreme cold and extreme heat. White Walkers are immortal. Their arrival is usually accompanied by blizzards and sudden temperature drops. Because of this, they can spread extreme cold wherever they go. The White Walkers wield swords and spears made from unique ice crystals . However, one of their most deadly abilities is to reanimate the dead as their servants, known as wights. They are capable of reviving any dead creature as wights, including horses, giants, and even dragons. They cannot, however, revive a corpse into servitude if it has been burned. Once a wight has been created, its eyes turn an icy blue, similar to the White Walkers\\' own eyes. Wights serve their masters without question. The Night King, leader of the White Walkers, possesses the ability to change humans into White Walkers. He picks up Craster\\'s son from an icy altar and places an index finger on its cheek, causing the baby\\'s eyes to glow blue and his skin to grow pale, taking on the appearance of the White Walkers. Whether or not this ability extends only to the Night King, all of the White Walkers amongst his caste, or all White Walkers in general is unknown. During the Massacre at Hardhome, White Walkers are shown to be resistant to fire due to the extreme cold they radiate, which snuffs out any flames in their vicinity. They can also freeze normal weapons they come into contact with, causing them to shatter and break. White Walkers are invulnerable against even highly concentrated dragonfire. It is unknown if they are also immune to wildfire . Weaknesses The only known weaknesses of White Walkers are weapons made of dragonglass or valyrian steel . Upon being stabbed by dragonglass, a White Walker\\'s body will begin to freeze into ice from the point at which it was stabbed, causing the Walker great pain. Finally, it will begin to crack and fall apart, eventually shattering into ice. Valyrian steel has the same effect, but works much more rapidly. These materials are also resistant to being frozen and shattered on contact with White Walkers, unlike regular weapons. White Walkers are \"glass cannons\", possessing incredible strength and power but being very vulnerable. Any injury, no matter how minor or significant from weapons made of dragonglass or valyrian steel, will result in their death and the deaths of all things they have reanimated. Because of this, White Walkers tend to stay behind their undead wights or far away from conflict. Since the Night King was the first White Walker ever created, his death will cause the death of all other White Walkers, and subsequently, their wights. As such, he is simultaneously the strongest and weakest part of the undead army. History Background The White Walkers\\' origins are a mystery to most humans. Only the ancient Children of the Forest remember the truth of how they came to be. Over eight thousand years before the War of the Five Kings, the Children of the Forest were locked in a war with the First Men , who had migrated to Westeros from Essos . Despite resorting to powerful magic , which allowed them to flood the Neck and even destroy the land-bridge linking the two continents and reducing it to a chain of islands , the Children were losing ground; more and more of them fell to the First Men and their precious forests were being cut down. Out of desperation, a small group of Greenseers attempted to create a powerful new weapon against the humans. They bound a captive man to a weirwood and pressed a cursed shard of dragonglass into his heart. The unfortunate captive was transformed into a cold, heartless, deathless creature whose only desire was to consume all life. He would become the progenitor of the White Walker race and lead his kind on a campaign of destruction, not only against humans, but against his creator\\'s as well. Soon the Children saw that their creation had grown beyond their control, and forged an alliance with the First Men to avoid mutual destruction. In what would become known as the \" Battle for the Dawn \", the alliance beat the White Walkers back to the far north , where they vanished. This victory led to a lasting truce between the Children and the First Men; the Children would keep their forests, and the Men could keep their farms, towns, and cities. The truce also marked the creation of both the Wall and the Night\\'s Watch, the latter having been armed by the Children with dragonglass blades, in case the Walkers should ever return. Season 1 At the start of the series , there have been peculiar rumors from beyond the Wall mentioning the White Walkers. According to Will , a renegade from the Night\\'s Watch taken captive near Winterfell , his patrol was attacked by the White Walkers and his comrades Gared and Waymar Royce were killed by them. Prior to this incident, the White Walkers had massacred a tribe of wildlings and left the corpses out as a warning. His story was not believed by Eddard Stark , who executed him as a deserter. The White Walkers showed an ability to animate the corpse of a dead wildling child as a wight. Jeor Mormont and Maester Aemon of the Watch ask Tyrion to persuade his sister to send them reinforcements. They claim there is something other than the wildlings beyond the Wall and it\\'s been growing in influence for some time. With winter coming they fear this unseen enemy will make its move. A band of wildlings fleeing south of the Wall passes close to Winterfell . One of them suggests taking a Stark captive for Mance Rayder , the King-Beyond-the-Wall , but the others refuse to return north due to the dangers posed by the White Walkers , instead asserting they should head as far south as possible. Osha , one of the wildlings taken prisoner at Winterfell, reveals to the Stark household that she and her companions were fleeing South to escape the Walkers. She also reveals the Walkers are nocturnal and sleep in the day and hunt at night. When her words are dismissed by Maester Luwin due to the belief the Walkers are long dead, she reveals that they were only sleeping and \"they\\'re not sleeping now.\" The bodies of several rangers are discovered a short distance north of the wall and are identified as Night\\'s Watchmen who have been missing for weeks. Despite a corpse\\'s prolonged absence, Sam notes that the bodies show no signs of rot and appear in perfect condition. Later that evening one of the bodies reanimates as a wight and attempts to attack the Lord Commander. The creature is stopped when Jon discovers the creature\\'s weakness is fire. After disposing of the remaining bodies, Sam tells Jon that he read that only the touch of a White Walker could do what they have seen tonight. A worried Sam notes the weakness of the Night\\'s Watch and if the White Walkers decide to come in force then they are in real trouble. After recent events Lord Commander Mormont decides to mobilize the Night\\'s Watch to head out beyond the wall to assess the situation and if necessary make a preemptive strike against their enemies. He explains to Jon that the war in the South is of little concern in relation to the threat of the returning White Walkers. Season 2 Jon Snow follows Craster into the woods and sees him placing a newborn baby, one of his sons, into the ground and leaves. Moments later a figure with glowing blue eyes appears and takes the baby away. After Craster discovers Jon, attacks him and orders the Night\\'s Watch to leave his roof , Mormont confronts Jon, though he also admits he\\'s aware that Craster worships the White Walkers and sacrifices his newborn sons to them in exchange for safety for him and his daughter-wives. Sam , Grenn , and Eddison Tollett gather dung around the Fist of the First Men when they hear a horn being blown and believe Jon and Qhorin have returned. They then hear a second blow, the signal for incoming wildlings, and draw their swords for battle. A third hornblast is heard, the signal for White Walkers, which has not been blown in thousands of years. The three run to the Night\\'s Watch camp but Samwell is left behind, while a blizzard envelops the entire plateau. He seeks refuge behind a rock while a White Walker leads a vast horde of wights. The White Walker finds Sam but for reasons unknown ignores him, riding past him atop a wight horse and leading the horde for an invasion, emitting a screeching roar with another White Walker far behind. Season 3 A White Walker attacks Sam and Gilly when they are seeking refuge in a destroyed cabin. Sam tries to stop the White Walker with his sword, but the Walker shatters it and throws him aside. The Walker then approaches Gilly, seeming intent on seizing her baby . Sam, on the ground, grabs one of the dragonglass daggers that he found at the Fist of the First Men . He attacks the Walker from behind, stabbing it in the shoulder. The Walker screeches in pain and quickly begins to freeze, shattering soon afterwards. Season 4 Rast sets the last son of Craster on the ground in the Haunted Forest . A White Walker , riding a wight horse, takes the baby to a mysterious place in the far north, to the Lands of Always Winter, and places him on an altar made of ice. Another White Walker with pointed horns on its head approaches, picks up the baby, and touches him on the face below his eye. The baby\\'s eyes turn bright blue, similar to that of the White Walkers. Season 5 The White Walkers launch an attack on Hardhome as the Free Folk board ships provided by Stannis Baratheon bound for Castle Black . During the attack, Jon fights one of the White Walkers, discovering their vulnerability to Valyrian steel, and kills it with his sword Longclaw , bringing him to the attention of the Night King. The wight army overwhelms the defenders and sends a panic through the settlement, and wildlings try to swim to the ships instead of boarding rowboats. Those that die are reanimated as wights by the Night King, who looks on intimidatingly as Jon, Eddison Tollett, and Tormund row away. Season 6 The Three-Eyed Raven shows Bran a vision of a heart tree amid spirals of standing stones in lush green valley. He spies Leaf and other Children of the Forest talking amongst themselves, then looking eagerly at a captive - a First Man - bound to the tree. Leaf approaches and slowly forces a dragonglass dagger into the captive\\'s chest. The captive screams, but does not die, instead becoming the first White Walker: the Night King. Bran immediately confronts Leaf about creating the White Walkers in the first place. Leaf tries to explain that they were at war with the First Men and were desperate to protect themselves from the invaders of their lands . Later, Bran is the only one in the cave awake and is anxious to warg back into the Weirwood tree. Unfortunately, the Night King is able to see him and grabs his arm, branding him with an icy mark. He breaks out of the vision with a scream. The Three-Eyed Raven tells Bran, Meera and Hodor that the Night King is now able to locate Bran and bypass the barrier keeping the White Walkers and wights out of the cave. The Children of the Forest use magic projectiles and incendiaries to fend the Walkers off, but are overwhelmed. They light a fire around the entrance which prevents the wights from entering, but the Walkers extinguish a pathway and walk through. The wights climb on top of the Weirwood, dropping through the top of the cave. Meera desperately tries to get Bran out of the vision and attempts to get the frightened Hodor to carry Bran away to no avail. Meera kills the first White Walker that enters with a dagger of dragonglass, as she fights alongside the remaining Children of the Forest to try to fend off the wights until Bran wakes up. Wights begin to swarm the cave, killing all of the Children of the Forest except for Leaf, as Meera starts yelling at Bran to warg into Hodor. Hodor in the cave puts Bran\\'s body on a sled and starts hauling him towards the exit at the back of the cave with Leaf and Meera, as Summer is killed attacking the wights. As the wights are closing in on them, Leaf sacrifices herself, using magic to cause a huge explosion, buying the other three a significant amount of time. While the Three-Eyed Raven and Bran are still sharing a vision, the Night King kills the Three-Eyed Raven, and his figure within Bran\\'s vision blows away as ashes and rags. Season 7 Somewhere beyond the Wall, the Night King and his White Walkers continue their march south through a snowstorm. As a sign of their growing strength, they have added at least three Giants to the ranks of their army of the dead. Jon takes Daenerys down into the caves on Dragonstone after she allows him to mine the dragonglass. However, his ulterior motive is to show her the carvings on the cave\\'s walls, which depict the Children of the Forest and the First Men fighting the White Walkers together. One of these carvings strongly resembles the Night King. Bran Stark wargs into a flight of ravens that fly over the Wall into the Lands of Always Winter. Through the ravens, he sees the army of the dead led by the White Walkers and the Night King, traveling south towards Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. Unfortunately, the Night King spots Bran, causing him to quickly disperse the ravens. As part of their plan to capture a wight as proof of existence of the army of the dead, Jon Snow and his men ambush a group of Wights led by a White Walker , lighting a campfire to get their attention. Jon himself kills the White Walker, at the same time destroying all but one of the wights under his command. While taking refuge from the wights on an island in the middle of a frozen lake, Beric Dondarrion advises Jon to kill the recently arrived Night King, potentially ending the threat of the Walkers and their army. As Daenerys and her dragons arrive to rescue the party, the Night King hurls an ice javelin at Viserion , killing him and sending him crashing into the frozen lake. He throws another at Drogon , but the dragon narrowly avoids it and escapes. Jon stays behind and fights his way to the Night King, only to fall beneath the ice of the lake. Later, after wights haul Viserion\\'s corpse out of the lake, the Night King resurrects him, bringing the beast under his control as an undead ice dragon . The White Walkers and the army of the dead finally reach the Wall where Eastwatch-by-the-Sea stands. The Night King uses Viserion to burn the Wall, nullifying its magic and allowing the White Walkers and their wights to cross into the Seven Kingdoms . Season 8 The White Walkers quickly advance south and attack Last Hearth , massacring the population and adding them to the army of the dead. Ned Umber is found pinned to a wall in the middle of severed arms arranged in a spiral, which Beric Dondarrion deduces is a message from the Night King. The White Walkers and their army quickly move further south. They arrive at Winterfell a half day after Tormund, Edd, and Beric bring word of the Fall of Last Hearth . The White Walkers finally arrive at Winterfell for the Battle of Winterfell. As the living assemble for the final battle, the White Walkers lead their army on their undead horses. The White Walkers send out their army to destroy the living and attack the castle while they hang back at the tree line. When Jon and Rhaegal try to attack them, a massive blizzard slams into them, preventing direct engagement with the White Walkers. The Night King, riding Viserion, commands the wights to scale the castle walls and break down the defenses. The Night King then battles Jon and Daenerys and their dragons. The two living dragons manage to overwhelm their dead brother and the Night King is thrown from his mount. Daenerys finds where the Night King landed and commands Drogon to burn him with dragonfire. To her shock and dismay, he emerges from the inferno unharmed and she retreats before he can strike her from the sky. Jon, whose severely injured mount barely manages to land safely, rushes towards the Night King, intent on ending the battle. But before he can get close, the Night King raises all of the corpses around him and walks off to find Bran, the new Three-Eyed Raven. The rest of the White Walkers enter the castle and rendezvous with the Night King before entering the godswood . The Walkers stand aside as the Night King kills Theon and walks towards Bran. Before the Night King can draw his blade and kill Bran, Arya attacks him with her Valyrian steel dagger . He grabs her midair, but through sleight of hand, Arya stabs the Night King in the heart. The Night King explodes into ice, causing the other White Walkers to explode and their entire wight army to crumple. With the death of the Night King, the White Walkers are now extinct and their magic ceased after thousands of years.', 'Previous Next Wars of the First Men and the Children of the Forest Thousand Years War Battle for the Dawn Beginning c. 8,000 BC End c. 8,000 BC (lasted a generation) Place Westeros Outcome Decisive victory for the Living White Walker invasion defeated and driven back to the Lands of Always Winter Construction of the Wall Foundation of House Stark Formation of the Night\\'s Watch Combatants The Living First Men Children of the Forest The Dead White Walkers Army of the Dead Commanders Azor Ahai Bran the Builder Night King White Walker lieutenants Eight thousand years before the Targaryen Conquest , a winter known as the Long Night descended upon the world , which lasted an entire generation. Thousands starved as the crops and fields lay buried under dozens of feet of snow. In the darkness and cold of the Long Night, the White Walkers descended upon Westeros from the farthest north, the polar regions of the Lands of Always Winter . The conflict that arose from the Long Night is known as the Battle for the Dawn as the White Walkers sought to bring an end to all life and to cover the world in an endless winter. Contents 1 History 1.1 Prelude 1.2 The Battle for the Dawn 1.3 Aftermath 1.4 Season 1 1.5 Season 5 1.6 Season 7 2 In the books 3 See also History Prelude The invasion of Westeros by the First Men and their encroachment into the lands of the Children of the Forest , the natives of Westeros, led to a long period of warfare between the two people for control of the continent. As the Children grew desperate, a group of their greenseers , resorted to dark magic, capturing one of the First Men and turning him into the first of the White Walkers , whose purpose was to protect the Children from the First Men. However, the White Walkers grew beyond their creators\\' control and became a threat to anyone living, becoming the most feared creatures in the known world . Recognizing the danger, the Children and the First Men reached a peace known as the Pact . The Battle for the Dawn None knew why the White Walkers came when they did, 2,000 years after the signing of the Pact and 8,000 years before Robert\\'s Rebellion , but they killed all in their path. The White Walkers reanimated the dead as Wights to kill the living at their command, and soon the White Walkers and their hordes of undead were sweeping across the continent. Eventually the First Men and the Children of the Forest formed an alliance and rallied to defend themselves. In a struggle known as the Battle for the Dawn , the White Walkers were defeated and driven back into the uttermost north, where the far northern lands became known as the Lands of Always Winter . The Wall , a massive fortification standing seven hundred feet high and stretching from one side of the continent to the other, was constructed by the First Men, Children, and giants along the northernmost isthmus of northern Westeros to bar the Walkers\\' return. Legend says that the Wall was infused with powerful magic spells by the Children of the Forest that prevent the White Walkers from crossing it. The ancient order of the Night\\'s Watch was founded to defend the Wall should the White Walkers return to invade the realms of men once more. Aftermath With the passing of the centuries and the coming of the Andals , memory of the Long Night and the Walkers faded into myth. In the present day, most believe the Long Night to be nothing more than a children\\'s story, and the White Walkers, Children of the Forest, and giants nothing more than legends. Belief in them survives only in the North , and even there they are presumed extinct. Certainly, none or very few were seen for the next eight thousand years between their supposed defeat and the time of Robert\\'s Rebellion . As the War of the Five Kings begins, disturbing reports have come back from the scouts of the Night\\'s Watch saying that, after an abnormally long summer, winter is returning and the White Walkers with it. There is a danger of another Long Night, but given that the great lords of Westeros are short-sightedly more concerned with their petty power struggles, most have simply ignored the warnings. The situation leaves only the under-supported and under-manned Night\\'s Watch to stand between the White Walkers and the realms of men. Season 1 After Catelyn Stark leaves for King\\'s Landing, Old Nan sits by Bran Stark ’s bedside to watch him. She suggests the story of Duncan the Tall and Bran replies that he hates her stories —he prefers the scary ones. She retorts that he is a \"sweet summer child\" who knows nothing about fear, and tells him that fear is for the winter and for the Long Night, a winter season thousands of years ago that lasted a generation, in which those who didn\\'t freeze to death had to face the White Walkers , who ventured south for the first time and swept through Westeros.\" Season 5 During Stannis Baratheon \\'s march to Winterfell , the weather turns for the worse and a snow storm delays his army. In order to better their chances of winning the upcoming battle in the snow which they both saw in the flames, Melisandre tries to convince Stannis to sacrifice more King\\'s blood —this time, Stannis\\' own daughter, Shireen . Stannis is visibly shocked and disgusted by the suggestion, asking her if she has lost her mind. She insists that Stannis must be the undisputed king when the the Long Night comes, but he rebuffs her and orders her to leave his presence.\" When Lord Commander Jon Snow and the wildling envoy Tormund travel to Hardhome to convince the Free Folk sheltered there to come back with them to Castle Black in order to settle south of the Wall , Jon Snow argues that the Long Night is coming and the dead come with it —and only together they can give the White Walkers a fight, and maybe even beat them back. Snow\\'s words prove immediately prophetic, as during the process of taking the wildlings to the ships the White Walkers arrive with thousands of wights and massacre most of the Free Folk. Season 7 While autopsying the body of Maester Weyland , Archmaester Ebrose tells Samwell Tarly that despite the widespread skepticism of his colleagues, Ebrose believes that the Long Night cannot be pure fabrication, since numerous unconnected sources all describe similar events. He maintains however, that if another, similar event is about to occur, that Westeros and its inhabitants will find a way to survive it. In the books As of the fifth novel in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, A Dance with Dragons , very little detail has been given about what actually happened in the Battle for the Dawn. Written history doesn\\'t date back that far (at least in Westeros), so only oral tradition and half-mythical accounts come down to the present. There are vague legends that a single First Man- whom Old Nan refers to in her stories as \"the last hero\"- unified both the First Men and the Children of the Forest and led them to victory. Stories about the Long Night are also found in lands far beyond Westeros , though they may not always refer to it as such. The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook explained that several cultures throughout the continent of Essos have their own legends of ancient cataclysms, all of which (supposedly) occurred around the same time as the generation-long winter. Also in these legends, the ways in which the Long Night was overcome all follow similar patterns to what is told in Westeros: Descendants of the Rhoynar people - who inhabited the regions of the modern-day Free Cities - claim that the mighty Rhoyne River froze as far south as one of its tributaries, the Selhoru (roughly where Myr and Tyrosh now lie), a claim which the maesters have confirmed with reasonable certainty. The Rhoynar believed that the Long Night only ended when a single hero beseeched Mother Rhoyne , the goddess of the river, along with the minor deities that were her children, to join together and sing a magical song which brought back the dawn. In Yi Ti , it is said the Lion of Night - the primary god worshiped in the region - fathered a son on the Maiden-Made-of-Light . Known as God-on-Earth , he was the first emperor of Yi Ti\\'s Great Empire of the Dawn (a semi-mythical civilization that allegedly existed during the Dawn Age before the Long Night). Thousands of years later, a descendant of God-on-Earth known as the Amethyst Empress was usurped and murdered by her own brother, an event known as the Blood Betrayal. This caused the Maiden-Made-of-Light to turn away from humanity in shame, and the Lion of Night came forth in all his wrath to punish mankind\\'s wickedness, inflicting the cold and darkness of the Long Night. According to the stories, the sun hid its face from the world for a lifetime, ashamed at something none could discover, and disaster was only averted by the deeds of a woman with a monkey\\'s tail. Stories about the Long Night are even found as far east as Asshai . According to Melisandre , a great darkness descended upon the land, and a hero known as Azor Ahai wielded a flaming sword named Lightbringer in battle against the darkness to win back the dawn. The holy texts of the Lord of Light prophesy that there will come a time when the Long Night will return, and Azor Ahai will be reborn to lead the people of the world to victory once again. This specific legend is apparently widespread across the Further East of Essos, because Azor Ahai is also known as Hyrkoon the Hero, Yin Tar, Neferion, and Eldric Shadowchaser, depending on the region in which the story is told.', 'Night King Season(s) 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 First seen \" The Lion and the Rose \" ( Bran \\'s vision ) \" Oathkeeper \" Last seen \" The Long Night \" Appeared in 10 episodes ( see below ) Status Age ~10,000 Date of birth c. 10,000 BC Death 305 AC at Winterfell Stabbed in the heart with the Valyrian steel dagger by Arya Stark during the Battle of Winterfell Death shown in episode \" The Long Night \" Allegiance White Walkers First Men (formerly, as a human) Culture White Walkers First Men (formerly, as a human) Portrayed by Richard Brake (Season 4-5) Vladimir Furdik (Season 6-8) The Night King was the master and the first of the White Walkers , having existed since the age of the First Men .

As the Children were losing the war, a small group of greenseers captured the unfortunate man and bound him to a heart tree to be used for a terrible purpose. Leaf , who was among the group, pressed a cursed dragonglass dagger into the captive\\'s chest, causing his eyes to turn blue and turning him into the first of the White Walkers. Thousands of years later , Leaf explains to Bran Stark that her people created the White Walkers to defend themselves when Westeros was invaded by the First Men , who were cutting their sacred trees down and slaughtering the Children of the Forest. However, the White Walkers soon turned on their creators and began what was known as the Long Night . Though the Long Night ended upon the First Men and Children\\'s victory in the War for the Dawn, the Night King survived and retreated with the rest of his kind to the Lands of Always Winter , where they hid and faded into legend. The Night King is a legendary figure, known by name among, at least, some noble Houses in the North . Season 4 The Night King first appears in a vision that Bran Stark has when Bran communes with a Weirwood Heart tree . He experiences a flood of images from the past, present, and future, many of which he was not physically present for. He does not comprehend what all of these images are but, in retrospect, one of them is an image of the Night King picking up the last of Craster \\'s sons off an ice altar. After Rast places Craster\\'s final son on the ground in the Haunted Forest , a White Walker takes the baby to a shattered mountain in the Lands of Always Winter , placing the baby on an icy altar ringed by large icy spikes. A group of thirteen black-garbed White Walkers are revealed to be viewing the proceedings from afar. One of them breaks from the middle of their number and approaches the altar, stopping to regard the human child for a moment before gently gathering him in its arms. The baby immediately calms, staring into the face of the Night King. He places his index finger upon the baby\\'s cheek, causing the child\\'s eyes to turn icy blue and its skin to grow pale: most likely the fate of Craster\\'s other sons. Season 5 The Night King appears again when Jon Snow and Tormund Giantsbane are coordinating the evacuation of Hardhome . Along with a small company of White Walkers, he observes the attack from one of the cliffs above the town as Jon slays one of his lieutenants with Longclaw , a Valyrian steel sword. The Night King looks on this turn of events with mild interest, shocked at his meaningful resistance. As Jon, Tormund and the remaining defenders leave on a boat, the Night King appears on the dock and locks eyes with Jon. With a mere lifting of his arms, the Night King raises the entirety of Hardhome\\'s dead but erstwhile defenders as wights , and keeps his gaze upon Jon as the boat slips away. Season 6 The Night King appears in one of Bran Stark \\'s visions, where he witnesses him as a human being transformed into a White Walker by the Children of the Forest , notably among them Leaf . She explains after his vision that they had to create the White Walkers as their defenders during the war with the First Men . Later, Bran makes the risky decision to experience a vision on his own, and finds himself looking at an army of wights and the Night King and other White Walkers at the back. Bran walks closer and is shocked to see that the Night King notices his presence. Bran wakes up screaming after the Night King suddenly appears right next to him and grabs his arm. The Three-Eyed Raven says that the Night King touched him, which Bran confirms when a blue hand-mark is seen on his forearm. The Three-Eyed Raven says because of that mark, the Night King now knows exactly where they are, and the cave cannot protect them any more. The Night King and his army quickly travel to the cave, preceded by their aura of cold, a signal to the Children of the Forest and Meera Reed . The Children of the Forest prepare their scarce defenses outside of the cave, but are quickly overrun and they are forced to retreat back to the tunnels. The Night King sends his army of wights to attack the tunnels, and they kill most of the Children and Summer , though Bran, Meera Reed , and Hodor manage to escape the cavern through a back tunnel. One of the other White Walkers is killed by a dragonglass -tipped spear thrown by Meera. The Night King enters the cavern, and glares at the greenseeing Three-Eyed Raven, his natural arch-nemesis as the memory of the known world , before he kills him with his falx. He then sends the rest of his wights to kill Leaf and eventually Hodor, who attempts to stop the wights from going further by sacrificing himself to hold the door. While Meera drags Bran through the snow, Bran sees visions of the Night King converting Craster\\'s last son into a White Walker, leading a massive attack on Hardhome, and branding him with his mark. In the aftermath of his victory at Winterfell and the confirmation from the Citadel that winter has come through white ravens , Jon Snow tells the gathered lords of the North and the Vale who wish to return home following Ramsay Bolton \\'s defeat to prepare for winter. He warns that the war is not over after Cley Cerwyn suggests it is with the defeat of House Bolton , alluding to the Night King as their true enemy, warning that the Night King won\\'t wait out the winter storms, because he is the one who brings the storm. Season 7 The Night King is shown leading his army of wights and White Walkers south, departing the Lands of Always Winter and heading towards the Wall at last. Sansa Stark and Jon Snow later discuss who the more dangerous enemy is, Cersei Lannister or the Night King, as well as the fact that the Wall still separates humanity from the White Walkers. Meanwhile, despite her obsession with defeating Cersei Lannister , who sits the Iron Throne , Daenerys Targaryen , a royal exile who has begun her war for Westeros , is told by Jon Snow, who has traveled to Dragonstone , that she will only be ruling a graveyard if the Night King attacks, as he is the true enemy. Jon takes Daenerys down into the caves on Dragonstone after she agrees to allow he and his people to mine the dragonglass beneath Dragonstone. However, Jon has something much more important in mind: showing her the ancient carvings by the Children of the Forest on the rocks, which depict the Children of the Forest and the First Men fighting the White Walkers together. One of these carvings strongly resembles the Night King leading the White Walkers. When Bran Stark wargs into a flock of ravens , he flies them beyond the Wall to spy on the army of the dead . He finds the Night King himself leading them, flanked by some of his lieutenants. When the Night King looks up, the ravens disperse, and Bran is pulled out of the warging. He urges Maester Wolkan to send ravens across Westeros informing the high lords that the Night King is on the move to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea . The Night King is present when the wights battle Jon Snow at the Wight Hunt , who traveled beyond the Wall with a band of warriors to attempt to capture a wight to use as proof for the gathered high lords of Westeros . Remembering their encounter from Hardhome, the Night King keeps his gaze on Jon for some time. Beric Dondarrion suggests trying to kill the Night King; as they know, killing a White Walker kills any and all wights it raised, so killing the Night King might destroy every such monster under his command, putting an end to the Great War before it truly begins. Jon dismisses the plan, however, arguing that trying to fight their way through the wights to reach the Night King would be suicide. When Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons come and attempt to rescue Jon and his group, the Night King hurls an ice spear toward Viserion , piercing the young dragon straight through the neck. Trailing blood and fire, Viserion crashes down to the frozen lake, sinking beneath the icy waters. The King keeps his gaze on the enraged Jon, who appears on the verge of calling him down to fight directly, but his lieutenant hands him another spear. The Night King throws it at Drogon , but the dragon takes flight and dodges in time. The Night King later has his wights haul Viserion\\'s corpse out of the water. Once that is accomplished, the Night King kneels in front of the dragon\\'s snout, placing a hand upon him. Moments later, Viserion is reanimated as his eyes open, now a depthless, icy blue. The mounted White Walkers lead the gathered army of the dead out of the Haunted Forest to the Wall, gathering in force at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea . Riding the reanimated Viserion and using his fiery breath, the Night King breaches the Wall, burning it until the eastermost portion of the icy fortification collapses, destroying the castle and allowing the White Walkers and their wight army to invade Westeros once more while the Night King flies overhead toward the North . Season 8 Led by the Night King, the White Walkers quickly advance south and attack Last Hearth , massacring the population and adding them to the army of the dead. Ned Umber is found pinned to a wall in the middle of severed arms arranged in a spiral, which Beric Dondarrion deduces is a message from the Night King himself. They burn the boy\\'s corpse when it suddenly reanimates. Winterfell prepares its defenses against the Night King. At a war council, Jon Snow suggests going after the Night King, referring to Beric Dondarrion\\'s earlier plan during the Wight Hunt . Bran Stark , as the new Three-Eyed Raven , offers to use himself as bait to draw out the Night King and lure him into a trap. Bran explains that the Night King will come after him because he wants to \"erase [the] world , and the [Three-Eyed Raven] is its memory .\" When the Battle of Winterfell begins, the Night King directs his forces from Viserion in the skies above Winterfell, his lieutenants placed along the outlying forest. During the battle, Bran wargs into several ravens to find him and lure him out of hiding. After directing his wights to move through Winterfell\\'s trenches, which were lit on fire in an attempt to prevent the army of the dead from advancing, the Night King engages in a fierce aerial duel with Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen on their own dragons, Rhaegal and Drogon , respectively, pursuing Daenerys on Drogon with Viserion\\'s blue flame. The Night King flies down and blasts a hole in Winterfell using Viserion by burning down some of its walls, but is suddenly attacked by Jon on Rhaegal, who fights with the dead Viserion. Before the Night King can kill them both, Daenerys flies in on Drogon and knocks into Viserion. The Night King falls from his mount, landing hundreds of feet below. Circling back, Daenerys sees the Night King standing below. On her command Drogon blasts him with dragon fire, but when the flames clear, to her horror the Night King stands unscathed. Smirking, he hurls an ice spear at Drogon, but Daenerys flies off to avoid it. Meanwhile Rhaegal, injured from his fight with Viserion, collapses into the ground, and Jon Snow tumbles off of him. Jon charges at the Night King as he is walking towards the breached walls at Winterfell, but the Night King becomes aware of him, turns, and calmly raises his arms to resurrect the corpses littered around them as wights. The dead all around the castle rise as well, and a new wave of fresh wights surges toward the defenders within. Even those buried in Winterfell\\'s crypts awake, smash through the walls and attack the non-combatants huddled there. Jon, surrounded by fresh wights, is held off while the Night King continues to pursue his target: the Three-Eyed Raven, Bran Stark. The Night King enters the godswood of Winterfell alongside other White Walkers as the wights finish off the remaining ironborn defending Bran. Theon Greyjoy charges at the Night King, but the Night King stops Theon\\'s charge, breaks his spear, and impales him, killing him. The Night King then walks up to the Three-Eyed Raven and glares at Bran as he begins to draw his ice blade to kill him. Suddenly, Arya Stark leaps at the Night King from behind with her Valyrian steel dagger . The Night King reacts in time, turning and grabbing her knife arm while seizing her by the throat with his other hand. But Arya has one more assassin’s trick up her sleeve: she drops the dagger, catching it with her free hand and plunges it into the Night King\\'s chest, causing him to explode into shards of ice. His death starts a chain reaction as the other White Walkers shatter in the same manner and all of the wights in the army of the dead and Viserion collapse to the ground, free of the curse that kept them reainmated. The Night King\\'s death marks the end of the Battle of Winterfell and the entire Great War with the living victorious. With the destruction of the Night King, the White Walkers become extinct, and the Long Night is forever prevented from returning. Abilities The Night King possessed a number of supernatural powers or abilities. Personality Little is known about his characteristics and traits before becoming the Night King, although he reacted with fear when Leaf plunged a shard of dragonglass into his chest. After becoming the Night King, he became nothing more than an emotionless killer with his only goal appearing to be to kill all in his path and add to his army, staying true to his nature as the first White Walker and being the ultimate embodiment of death. Despite this, he did display some emotion at times. He appeared quite pleased when he picked up Craster\\'s last son and transformed him into a new White Walker. He looked at Jon Snow with mild interest when one of his lieutenants fell at Jon\\'s hand. He was incredibly sadistic and bloodthirsty, directing Jon Snow\\'s attention to the freshly slaughtered wildlings before raising them to add to his army, holding his gaze in order to intimidate Jon Snow. When overwhelming Leaf and the other Children of the Forest at the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven , the Night King smirked, possibly amused at the prospect of slaughtering his former captors and creators. Later, at the Battle of Winterfell , the Night King again smirked at Daenerys and Jon\\'s attempts to destroy him with dragonfire and Valyrian steel. Despite his powers, he is not overconfident in his abilities and is capable of self-preservation, knowing his death ends his campaign. He does not take part in the massacre at Hardhome. When Jon Snow attempted to confront the Night King, the latter, having seen Jon\\'s means and skills to kill White Walkers first hand, refuses to fight him and raises wights to deal with Jon. The Night King appears to have some sense of honor when it comes to single combat. He accepted Theon\\'s challenge to fight him and killed Theon himself, despite being able to allow his White Walkers and wights to kill Theon if he so chose, though it may be because he knew he could easily defeat Theon. One aspect of the Night King\\'s personality is his strong hatred for Three-Eyed Ravens, their powers being a representation of what he wants to destroy, having tried to kill them multiple times. His hate is so strong that he personally led the attack on the cave and refused to allow his White Walkers and wights to kill the previous Three-Eyed Raven , committing the deed himself. The living used this hatred against the Night King to bait him, for Bran warging into ravens to the Night King led to the latter personally attacking Winterfell.

Wights were often referred to collectively as the Army of the Dead , or simply as the dead .

Many stories claim that White Walkers alone had the ability to create wights. A wight may be created from any cadaver that remains relatively intact, whether a fresh corpse or skeletal remains. Samwell Tarly noted that the wights he had encountered had been dead for weeks, yet they exhibited no signs of rot or decay. Regardless of their eye color while alive, all wights had icy blue eyes like those of their masters, assuming the corpse in question still had intact eyes. Wights were also nigh-indestructible and could withstand an injury that would normally be fatal, including stab wounds and the removal of limbs; even amputated limbs would still move around on their own. Decapitation was ineffective, as the headless corpse would keep moving, albeit robbed of its sensory organs. However, wights were extremely susceptible and vulernable to fire. Their flesh and bones were extremely flammable, as if it were coated in oil: it would easily catch fire and continue to burn if exposed to even a small amount of flame. The only sure way to prevent a corpse from being raised was to burn it. As a precaution against wights, the Free Folk burn their dead so they cannot be revived as wights. Just like the White Walkers, wights can also be killed permanently by weapons made of dragonglass or Valyrian steel . It was also revealed that if a White Walker died, the wights that it raised would also be instantly destroyed, demonstrating some sort of essential magical bond between the Walkers and their wights. A wight\\'s physical condition would roughly match the condition the corpse was in when it was reanimated. A corpse that was killed in a relatively non-violent way and which was resurrected soon after death would still seem relatively lifelike, conceivably passing off as the living had it not been for the dramatically altered color of their eyes. In contrast, a corpse that died violently or which was resurrected long after it died and it had already begun to decompose would still look like a maimed, rotting corpse. Reanimation would slow the physical process of rot and decay, but otherwise it did not restore previous damage. A corpse with a broken leg will not magically have the leg healed when it is reanimated into a wight. A wight that had been reanimated for a long time, six months to two years, would start to decompose slightly, with parts of its flesh rotting away while other flesh dried out leathery. This did not affect their mobility: wights that had been dead for many years could rot away until they are almost skeletal, with exposed bones held together by sinews and shreds of muscle. Wights were not particularly intelligent, and it was debatable if these creatures were truly sapient and possessed self-awareness. They lacked the ability to speak, uttering only bestial growls and hisses. They did seem to be able to carry out the basic attack commands of the White Walkers, but seemed to function on more of a \"zombie\" level of instinct. They could communicate with each other in a way, as shown when Jon Snow\\'s team tackled a wight in order to capture it, it let out an ear-piercing screech that alerted thousands of other wights to rush to its position. They could remember how to use a sword, albeit in a crude hack-and-slash attack, but they were observed using bows and arrows or other complex tools. Exactly how much wights remembered of their previous lives was unclear, or if they even remembered them at all. The wight of Othor , a member of the Night\\'s Watch , did seem to remember the way to Lord Commander Jeor Mormont \\'s quarters to try to attack him. Non-human races, such as giants , could also be reanimated as wights. The White Walkers were also shown to be capable of reviving any dead animal as a wight, such as horses , snow bears , and dragons . White Walkers had been observed riding horse-wights as mounts.

History Season 1 During a scouting mission beyond the Wall , Will of the Night\\'s Watch sees the corpse of a young wildling girl standing and walking. He flees from her. The corpses of two members of Benjen Stark \\'s scouting party, Othor and Jafer Flowers , are found in the outskirts of the Haunted Forest near the Wall . They are taken back through the Wall to Castle Black , and Sam notes that despite being dead for weeks, rot hasn\\'t set in. Later that night, they reanimate as wights, and Othor attacks Jon Snow and Lord Commander Jeor Mormont . The creature survives every kind of attack, including impalement and having its arm cut off, until Jon Snow throws a lamp at it, setting it on fire. Both corpses are then burned completely, with Samwell Tarly pointing out their likely nature to all present. Outside Eastwatch-by-the-Sea , Cotter Pyke \\'s rangers discover four wights and wisely burn their bodies. Season 2 Surrounded by a snowy fog, Samwell sees a massive army of wights is being led by White Walkers towards the Night\\'s Watch encampment on top of the Fist of the First Men . Some of the White Walkers ride atop wight horses. Season 3 Following the Battle of the Fist of the First Men , a wight chases Samwell Tarly but is stopped by Ghost and then set on fire by Lord Commander Mormont. All of the black brothers slain at the Fist of the First Men have been turned into wights. Only the mutilated horses have been left behind by the White Walkers. Season 4 A White Walker , riding atop a wight horse, takes the last son of Craster to the abode of his masters at the Lands of Always Winter . As Bran Stark and his companions reach the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven , they are attacked by a group of wights that emerge from the snow-covered ground. The wights manage to injure Jojen Reed fatally, while Bran, Meera , Hodor , and Summer are saved by the intervention of a mysterious girl , who is actually one of the Children of the Forest . The remaining wights are destroyed by the magic protecting the cave. Season 5 At Hardhome , as the Free Folk begin to row towards the ships to go back to the Wall with the Night\\'s Watch, a storm suddenly brews atop the hills, a sign that White Walkers are coming. Seeing this sign, Loboda orders the gates to be shut, leaving behind many wildlings. The screams suddenly come to an abrupt ending, and are immediately seen reanimated as Wights. The Wights serve as the executors for the White Walkers during the Massacre at Hardhome . At the end of the massacre, the Night King is seen on the dock, locking eyes with Jon Snow. He slowly raises his arms and reanimates all of the massacred free folk as wights to continue to serve at the will of the White Walkers. Death only strengthens the numbers for the White Walkers, a horrible realization to Jon Snow, Tormund, and the rest of the surviving Free Folk and Night\\'s Watch. Season 6 While in the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven , Bran goes behind the Three-Eyed Raven \\'s back and enters a vision where he sees a massive and motionless army of wights gathered by a frozen weir wood tree. As Bran walks through their ranks, he is visibly disturbed yet none of the wights seem to notice him. The Night King, mounted on a wight horse, notices his presence and immediately all the wights in the army turn around to stare at Bran. He then notices the Night King is suddenly standing beside him. As he tries to flee, the Night King grabs Bran\\'s forearm, causing him to cry out in pain and end the vision. Later, as Meera and Hodor are preparing to flee the cave, they notice the air is so cold their breath is visible. Meera goes to the cave\\'s entrance, only to be faced with the Army of the Dead, led by the Night King and three other White Walkers. Leaf and The Children of the Forest use magic projectiles to destroy dozens of wights, but are quickly overwhelmed. They light a fire around the entrance to prevent the wights from entering but the Walkers are able to pass through. The wights end up climbing over the Weirwood and crawling through roots at the top of the cave. Meera and the Children fend off several wights as she desperately tries to get the unconscious Bran out from his vision, but the wights quickly swarm the cave, killing all of the Children of the Forest except for Leaf. As Hodor, Meera and Leaf drag the unconscious Bran down a long tunnel toward the exit, Summer charges at the swarm of wights in an attempt to protect his owner and is quickly and brutally mauled to death. The wights continue forward, crawling on all sides of the tunnel and the ceiling. As they close in, Leaf sacrifices herself, using magic to cause a fiery explosion as she is stabbed to death, buying the other three just enough time to get to a door at the end of the tunnel. With some difficulty Hodor pushes the door open and pulls Bran through, coming back to help Meera close it just as the swarm reaches them. Meera grabs Bran\\'s sled and yells at Hodor to \"Hold the door!\". Hodor braces himself against the door long enough for Meera and Bran to escape into the tundra. Inevitably, the wights begin to break through the wood of the door and begin scratching and stabbing a visibly distressed Hodor, who sadly watches his friends disappear into the snow. The wights continue to pursue Meera and Bran into the forest. Shortly before the dead can catch up to them, however, the duo are saved by a mysterious figure clad in black. He later identifies himself as Benjen Stark , Bran\\'s long lost uncle and the former First Ranger of the Night\\'s Watch . Season 7 The White Walkers are shown leading the Army of the Dead south, now with increased numbers, having at least three undead giants . At Winterfell , Jon Snow receives a raven from Tyrion Lannister inviting him to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys Targaryen , who has begun her war for Westeros and claims the Iron Throne . Sansa Stark and Davos Seaworth both believe he shouldn\\'t go, though Davos recalls how Jon told him that fire kills wights and mentions how Daenerys does have three fire breathing dragons . Later, Jon receives a raven from Samwell Tarly at the Citadel in Oldtown telling him that there is dragonglass beneath Dragonstone, which can kill both White Walkers and wights, convincing him to ride to White Harbor and depart for Dragonstone to try and convince Daenerys to help them in the Great War to come. He leaves Sansa in charge of the North in his absence. Jon tries to make it clear to Daenerys Targaryen that the Army of the Dead is the true enemy, but she is clearly more concerned with Cersei Lannister . However, she later allows him to mine the dragonglass, but is still weary of his unwillingness to bend the knee. Bran Stark wargs into a flock of ravens that fly over the Wall into the Lands of Always Winter. Through the ravens, he sees the Army of the Dead led by the White Walkers and the Night King, travelling south towards Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. After the Wight Hunt , where a wight is captured by Jon Snow and his party, using four anchoring chains, the dead dragon Viserion is pulled out from underneath the icy water. The Night King kneels on the ground, placing a hand on the dragon and raising the corpse of Viserion as a wight. The captured wight is presented by Sandor Clegane and Jon Snow to the attendants of the Dragonpit Summit . Sandor demonstrates that wights can be cut apart with ordinary weapons without dying or showing pain. Jon then burns the wight\\'s arm, and the wight expresses pain. He finally kills the wight with a dagger of dragonglass . The White Walkers later lead the wight army out of the Haunted Forest to the Wall , marching close to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea before stopping, seemingly relieving the Eastwatch garrison, Tormund and Beric Dondarrion among them. Suddenly, the Night King, riding the undead Viserion, bursts from the sky and has Viserion breathe magical blue fire onto the Wall, creating a breach that nullifies the ancient spells of the Wall and allows the White Walkers and the wights to cross at last. Season 8 The surviving Free Folk , Brotherhood Without Banners , and Night\\'s Watch members encounter each other at Last Hearth after abandoning the Wall . There they find the castle\\'s inhabitants butchered and mutilated by the Army of the Dead. In the great hall they see a spiral made of human arms and Ned Umber pinned at the center. Beric Dondarrion says it is a message from the Night King at which point Ned reanimates as a wight and tries to attack Tormund but Beric lights the wight and the spiral on fire with his sword. Remaining at a distance from Winterfell , the White Walkers send their wights into the Battle of Winterfell against the alliance of living armies after the wights stop a Dothraki charge, killing most of the Dothraki screamers. The wights overwhelm the defending Unsullied and slaughter the Northern and Vale soldiers and knights , forcing the Targaryen , Stark , and Arryn forces to fall back behind the castle\\'s walls. The wights are stopped when Melisandre lights the massive trench surrounding Winterfell on fire, but the Night King commands them to move forward, and some wights throw themselves on the fire to cover it and allow the rest of the Army of the Dead to pass through the breaches. The wights are able to get through into Winterfell, massing up the castle walls. A wight giant breaks through Winterfell\\'s gates but is killed by Lyanna Mormont , who dies from being crushed by the giant\\'s hand. The dead continue to fight the living inside the walls of Winterfell. After retreating inside, Arya Stark finds herself sneaking around wights in Winterfell\\'s library, but she is discovered and forced to run. Arya is saved by Sandor Clegane and Lord Beric Dondarrion , who sacrifices himself saving Arya from the wights. Outside, the Night King uses the wight dragon Viserion to melt one of Winterfell\\'s towers, and even after being knocked off a cut Viserion, the Night King advances towards Winterfell, though on foot. Jon Snow charges at the Night King but is unable to reach him before the Night King, once again, reanimates the dead as wights in front on Jon, and all those who have fallen fighting the Army of the Dead at Winterfell rise again as wights, holding Jon off. Jon is rescued by Daenerys Targaryen on Drogon and pursues the Night King into Winterfell, but Daenerys falls off Drogon when he is attacked by wights, causing Drogon to fly away. Daenerys is alone and surrounded by wights until Ser Jorah Mormont comes to her defense, though he dies protecting his queen. Many wights follow the White Walkers as they enter through Winterfell\\'s gates and regroup with the Night King at the Winterfell godswood , where the Night King aims to kill the new Three-Eyed Raven , Bran Stark . However, the Night King is destroyed by Arya Stark before he can kill Bran, setting off a chain reaction that destroys the White Walkers, which the Night King created, and their wights, which the White Walkers each created. This ends the Army of the Dead.

However, the wights that attack Bran\\'s group in \"The Children\", as well as those that attack the wildlings and the Night\\'s Watch in the Massacre at Hardhome , are quite fast, and have rotted to the point that they are little more than skeletons. Director of \"The Children\" Alex Graves confirmed in a subsequent interview that this was indeed an homage to special effects legend Ray Harryhausen \\'s famous stop-motion skeleton warriors fight scene in the 1963 film Jason and the Argonauts . Graves stated that the homage was his suggestion, which Benioff and Weiss then agreed to. Graves said: The wights that attack Bran\\'s group actually aren\\'t entirely CGI creations, but stuntmen wearing greenscreen suits, with heavy prosthetics then added on over them, i.e. parts that aren\\'t too rotted away such as their head or chest are prosthetics, but an arm that had entirely rotted away to nothing but bone was produced by having the stuntman wear a long green sleeve which could then be digitally replaced. While the faster wights might started out as an homage to Harryhausen in Season 4, director Miguel Sapochnik explained that Benioff and Weiss stressed to him that for Season 5 \\'s \" Hardhome \" they wanted to visually distinguish wights from more traditional \"zombies\" (such as featured on The Walking Dead ), apparently worried that in the visual medium of television, audiences would find them too generic. Sapochnik said: Wights in the novels are indeed not exactly like zombies: they can\\'t turn other people into wights with infectious bites, every body part keeps moving even if amputated, etc. (the term \" revenant \" is a closer description). Wight prosthetics stages In Season 5 , prosthetics supervisor Barry Gower explained that the production team has developed three different categories or stages of wight prosthetics, based on how much they have decomposed: 1 - \"Super Fresh\" - have only been dead about one or two weeks. Their skin is dead and discolored, but except for major injuries that killed them, they are relatively intact and recognizable. 2 - \"Mid Decomps\" - mid-decomposition; they\\'ve been dead for about six months to two years. Physically intact but much more rotten, with dried dead skin stretched taut across their faces. On many of them their lips have rotted away or been gnawed off in the process of attacking others, permanently exposing their teeth. 3 - \"Greenscreens\" - dead for so long that large chunks of their bodies have rotted away, and they are near-skeletal, requiring greenscreen suits to depict. The \"Greenscreen\" wights are achieved by having stuntmen wear a mix of heavy prosthetics and large patches of greenscreen clothing - in post-production this is digitally replaced with exposed bones, holes in their heads, etc. (negative space that it would be impossible for real prosthetics to depict). In the books In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Others (the book term for the White Walkers) are able to animate corpses, human and animals alike, to serve them as footmen or mounts. According to old records, the Others are capable of reviving any dead animal as a wight, such as horses, dogs, and bears - and potentially direwolves , mammoths , giants , ice spiders , and even aquatic animals. Exactly how the White Walkers reanimate corpses into wights has never been revealed in the narrative, though it apparently occurs fairly quickly and can be done in the field: after Waymar Royce is killed by the Others Will flees, but only a few minutes later he is attacked by Waymar\\'s reanimated corpse. The TV series in Season 5 simply showed the Night King silently raising his arms, at which thousands of corpses rose as wights. There is no mentioning in the novels that the Others can revive dead dragons, as seen in the show, but it is not impossible, given that they can revive dead humans and animals. Wights are easily identified by their eyes having turned bright blue like two blue stars, regardless of the eye color they had while being alive. When they are destroyed, the blue disappears from their eyes. Unlike the Others, they are slow and clumsy. They have a queer, cold scent that can panic animals if they catch a whiff of it. Wights may lie motionless for days and will not rot, not even stink; no scavengers or maggots will disturb them. When Othor and Jafer\\'s bodies were brought to Castle Black, one of the strange things that the onlookers noticed about them was that both corpses had blue eyes, while they had different eye color in their lives. In the corresponding scene of the TV series, none of the corpses has blue eyes. When Othor the wight fights Jon, it has blue eyes, but they are not glowing. When the wights are dismembered, they continue to attack as if no harm happened to them, while the severed limbs continue to function independently regardless of what happens to the body itself, as happened to Jon while fighting the wight Othor : Jon cut off Othor\\'s arm, yet the severed limb grabbed at his calf, and he barely managed to pry the fingers off his leg. The severed hand that Ghost tore off Jafer\\'s corpse continued to twitch and stir even after Jafer was destroyed, until it finally had rotted away while Alliser Thorne was waiting for an audience at King\\'s Landing . Not even beheading a wight will stop it: the wight of Jafer Flowers continued to move around and even kill after its head was cut off. Dragonglass, which is lethal to the Others, is useless against wights - unlike the TV show wights. Sam discovers that by trial-and-error: on the way to Castle Black, a wight attacks him and Gilly (in the show it was replaced with an Other). Sam stabs the wight with a dragonglass dagger, and the dagger shatters to pieces. Sam stabs the wight with his steel dagger, but it just bounces off the wight\\'s iron mail (it would hardly matter even if the wight was not armored, since stabbing does not affect wights, as Jon discovered). Desperately, Sam grabs a burning piece of wood and shoves it into the wight\\'s mouth. The wight is immediately destroyed, but shortly afterwards Sam and Gilly are surrounded by dozens of wights. They are saved by a mysterious person called Coldhands and a pack of ravens, that attack the wights and tear them apart. Later, Sam tells Melisandre about the anomaly, that what kills Others is ineffective against wights. She explained \" Necromancy animates these wights, yet they are still only dead flesh. Steel and fire will serve for them. The ones you call the Others are something more \". Thus far, fire is still the only effective weapon against wights. After becoming Lord Commander, in the fifth novel Jon Snow explicitly points out to his men that they really don\\'t know how intelligent or self-aware wights are. They\\'ve never seen a wight talk, but that doesn\\'t necessarily prove that they can\\'t, or if wights can understand what it said to them (or if the White Walkers can hear through them, etc.). Jon also recalls that (back in the first novel) the wight of Othor that he killed remembered specifically what route to take in Castle Black to get to Jeor Mormont \\'s chamber. Jon commands that two wildling corpses be put into one of the ice cells in the Wall, chained in irons, hoping that if and when they rise again as wights the Watch can study them for weaknesses - but they stubbornly remain dead (possibly because there are no White Walkers nearby to reanimate them). To be clear, being bitten by a wight will not turn someone into a wight. Wights can only be created by the White Walkers when they reanimate corpses. Although they share some characteristics with classic depictions of \"zombies\", they aren\\'t the same thing. Of course, a major part of the White Walkers\\' tactics still involves the exponential zombie growth rate of their hordes of wights: people killed by a wight (not bitten, but just with a sword, etc.) can then in turn be resurrected into more wights by the White Walkers, who will in turn kill even more people so the White Walkers can turn them into even more wights, ad infinitum .', 'Wights Also known as Army of the Dead The dead Status Extinct Location Transitory Beyond the Wall (formerly) Ruler { Night King } { White Walkers } Distinctive features Glowing blue eyes Undead, often displaying mortal injuries Decaying flesh Extremely flammable A wight was a reanimated corpse, either human or animal, raised from death by the White Walkers using necromancy to act as their minions.

Many stories claim that White Walkers alone had the ability to create wights. A wight may be created from any cadaver that remains relatively intact, whether a fresh corpse or skeletal remains. Samwell Tarly noted that the wights he had encountered had been dead for weeks, yet they exhibited no signs of rot or decay. Regardless of their eye color while alive, all wights had icy blue eyes like those of their masters, assuming the corpse in question still had intact eyes. Wights were also nigh-indestructible and could withstand an injury that would normally be fatal, including stab wounds and the removal of limbs; even amputated limbs would still move around on their own. Decapitation was ineffective, as the headless corpse would keep moving, albeit robbed of its sensory organs. However, wights were extremely susceptible and vulernable to fire. Their flesh and bones were extremely flammable, as if it were coated in oil: it would easily catch fire and continue to burn if exposed to even a small amount of flame. The only sure way to prevent a corpse from being raised was to burn it. As a precaution against wights, the Free Folk burn their dead so they cannot be revived as wights. Just like the White Walkers, wights can also be killed permanently by weapons made of dragonglass or Valyrian steel . It was also revealed that if a White Walker died, the wights that it raised would also be instantly destroyed, demonstrating some sort of essential magical bond between the Walkers and their wights. A wight\\'s physical condition would roughly match the condition the corpse was in when it was reanimated. A corpse that was killed in a relatively non-violent way and which was resurrected soon after death would still seem relatively lifelike, conceivably passing off as the living had it not been for the dramatically altered color of their eyes. In contrast, a corpse that died violently or which was resurrected long after it died and it had already begun to decompose would still look like a maimed, rotting corpse. Reanimation would slow the physical process of rot and decay, but otherwise it did not restore previous damage. A corpse with a broken leg will not magically have the leg healed when it is reanimated into a wight. A wight that had been reanimated for a long time, six months to two years, would start to decompose slightly, with parts of its flesh rotting away while other flesh dried out leathery. This did not affect their mobility: wights that had been dead for many years could rot away until they are almost skeletal, with exposed bones held together by sinews and shreds of muscle. Wights were not particularly intelligent, and it was debatable if these creatures were truly sapient and possessed self-awareness. They lacked the ability to speak, uttering only bestial growls and hisses. They did seem to be able to carry out the basic attack commands of the White Walkers, but seemed to function on more of a \"zombie\" level of instinct. They could communicate with each other in a way, as shown when Jon Snow\\'s team tackled a wight in order to capture it, it let out an ear-piercing screech that alerted thousands of other wights to rush to its position. They could remember how to use a sword, albeit in a crude hack-and-slash attack, but they were observed using bows and arrows or other complex tools. Exactly how much wights remembered of their previous lives was unclear, or if they even remembered them at all. The wight of Othor , a member of the Night\\'s Watch , did seem to remember the way to Lord Commander Jeor Mormont \\'s quarters to try to attack him. Non-human races, such as giants , could also be reanimated as wights. The White Walkers were also shown to be capable of reviving any dead animal as a wight, such as horses , snow bears , and dragons . White Walkers had been observed riding horse-wights as mounts.

History Season 1 During a scouting mission beyond the Wall , Will of the Night\\'s Watch sees the corpse of a young wildling girl standing and walking. He flees from her. The corpses of two members of Benjen Stark \\'s scouting party, Othor and Jafer Flowers , are found in the outskirts of the Haunted Forest near the Wall . They are taken back through the Wall to Castle Black , and Sam notes that despite being dead for weeks, rot hasn\\'t set in. Later that night, they reanimate as wights, and Othor attacks Jon Snow and Lord Commander Jeor Mormont . The creature survives every kind of attack, including impalement and having its arm cut off, until Jon Snow throws a lamp at it, setting it on fire. Both corpses are then burned completely, with Samwell Tarly pointing out their likely nature to all present. Outside Eastwatch-by-the-Sea , Cotter Pyke \\'s rangers discover four wights and wisely burn their bodies. Season 2 Surrounded by a snowy fog, Samwell sees a massive army of wights is being led by White Walkers towards the Night\\'s Watch encampment on top of the Fist of the First Men . Some of the White Walkers ride atop wight horses. Season 3 Following the Battle of the Fist of the First Men , a wight chases Samwell Tarly but is stopped by Ghost and then set on fire by Lord Commander Mormont. All of the black brothers slain at the Fist of the First Men have been turned into wights. Only the mutilated horses have been left behind by the White Walkers. Season 4 A White Walker , riding atop a wight horse, takes the last son of Craster to the abode of his masters at the Lands of Always Winter . As Bran Stark and his companions reach the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven , they are attacked by a group of wights that emerge from the snow-covered ground. The wights manage to injure Jojen Reed fatally, while Bran, Meera , Hodor , and Summer are saved by the intervention of a mysterious girl , who is actually one of the Children of the Forest . The remaining wights are destroyed by the magic protecting the cave. Season 5 At Hardhome , as the Free Folk begin to row towards the ships to go back to the Wall with the Night\\'s Watch, a storm suddenly brews atop the hills, a sign that White Walkers are coming. Seeing this sign, Loboda orders the gates to be shut, leaving behind many wildlings. The screams suddenly come to an abrupt ending, and are immediately seen reanimated as Wights. The Wights serve as the executors for the White Walkers during the Massacre at Hardhome . At the end of the massacre, the Night King is seen on the dock, locking eyes with Jon Snow. He slowly raises his arms and reanimates all of the massacred free folk as wights to continue to serve at the will of the White Walkers. Death only strengthens the numbers for the White Walkers, a horrible realization to Jon Snow, Tormund, and the rest of the surviving Free Folk and Night\\'s Watch. Season 6 While in the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven , Bran goes behind the Three-Eyed Raven \\'s back and enters a vision where he sees a massive and motionless army of wights gathered by a frozen weir wood tree. As Bran walks through their ranks, he is visibly disturbed yet none of the wights seem to notice him. The Night King, mounted on a wight horse, notices his presence and immediately all the wights in the army turn around to stare at Bran. He then notices the Night King is suddenly standing beside him. As he tries to flee, the Night King grabs Bran\\'s forearm, causing him to cry out in pain and end the vision. Later, as Meera and Hodor are preparing to flee the cave, they notice the air is so cold their breath is visible. Meera goes to the cave\\'s entrance, only to be faced with the Army of the Dead, led by the Night King and three other White Walkers. Leaf and The Children of the Forest use magic projectiles to destroy dozens of wights, but are quickly overwhelmed. They light a fire around the entrance to prevent the wights from entering but the Walkers are able to pass through. The wights end up climbing over the Weirwood and crawling through roots at the top of the cave. Meera and the Children fend off several wights as she desperately tries to get the unconscious Bran out from his vision, but the wights quickly swarm the cave, killing all of the Children of the Forest except for Leaf. As Hodor, Meera and Leaf drag the unconscious Bran down a long tunnel toward the exit, Summer charges at the swarm of wights in an attempt to protect his owner and is quickly and brutally mauled to death. The wights continue forward, crawling on all sides of the tunnel and the ceiling. As they close in, Leaf sacrifices herself, using magic to cause a fiery explosion as she is stabbed to death, buying the other three just enough time to get to a door at the end of the tunnel. With some difficulty Hodor pushes the door open and pulls Bran through, coming back to help Meera close it just as the swarm reaches them. Meera grabs Bran\\'s sled and yells at Hodor to \"Hold the door!\". Hodor braces himself against the door long enough for Meera and Bran to escape into the tundra. Inevitably, the wights begin to break through the wood of the door and begin scratching and stabbing a visibly distressed Hodor, who sadly watches his friends disappear into the snow. The wights continue to pursue Meera and Bran into the forest. Shortly before the dead can catch up to them, however, the duo are saved by a mysterious figure clad in black. He later identifies himself as Benjen Stark , Bran\\'s long lost uncle and the former First Ranger of the Night\\'s Watch . Season 7 The White Walkers are shown leading the Army of the Dead south, now with increased numbers, having at least three undead giants . At Winterfell , Jon Snow receives a raven from Tyrion Lannister inviting him to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys Targaryen , who has begun her war for Westeros and claims the Iron Throne . Sansa Stark and Davos Seaworth both believe he shouldn\\'t go, though Davos recalls how Jon told him that fire kills wights and mentions how Daenerys does have three fire breathing dragons . Later, Jon receives a raven from Samwell Tarly at the Citadel in Oldtown telling him that there is dragonglass beneath Dragonstone, which can kill both White Walkers and wights, convincing him to ride to White Harbor and depart for Dragonstone to try and convince Daenerys to help them in the Great War to come. He leaves Sansa in charge of the North in his absence. Jon tries to make it clear to Daenerys Targaryen that the Army of the Dead is the true enemy, but she is clearly more concerned with Cersei Lannister . However, she later allows him to mine the dragonglass, but is still weary of his unwillingness to bend the knee. Bran Stark wargs into a flock of ravens that fly over the Wall into the Lands of Always Winter. Through the ravens, he sees the Army of the Dead led by the White Walkers and the Night King, travelling south towards Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. After the Wight Hunt , where a wight is captured by Jon Snow and his party, using four anchoring chains, the dead dragon Viserion is pulled out from underneath the icy water. The Night King kneels on the ground, placing a hand on the dragon and raising the corpse of Viserion as a wight. The captured wight is presented by Sandor Clegane and Jon Snow to the attendants of the Dragonpit Summit . Sandor demonstrates that wights can be cut apart with ordinary weapons without dying or showing pain. Jon then burns the wight\\'s arm, and the wight expresses pain. He finally kills the wight with a dagger of dragonglass . The White Walkers later lead the wight army out of the Haunted Forest to the Wall , marching close to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea before stopping, seemingly relieving the Eastwatch garrison, Tormund and Beric Dondarrion among them. Suddenly, the Night King, riding the undead Viserion, bursts from the sky and has Viserion breathe magical blue fire onto the Wall, creating a breach that nullifies the ancient spells of the Wall and allows the White Walkers and the wights to cross at last. Season 8 The surviving Free Folk , Brotherhood Without Banners , and Night\\'s Watch members encounter each other at Last Hearth after abandoning the Wall . There they find the castle\\'s inhabitants butchered and mutilated by the Army of the Dead. In the great hall they see a spiral made of human arms and Ned Umber pinned at the center. Beric Dondarrion says it is a message from the Night King at which point Ned reanimates as a wight and tries to attack Tormund but Beric lights the wight and the spiral on fire with his sword. Remaining at a distance from Winterfell , the White Walkers send their wights into the Battle of Winterfell against the alliance of living armies after the wights stop a Dothraki charge, killing most of the Dothraki screamers. The wights overwhelm the defending Unsullied and slaughter the Northern and Vale soldiers and knights , forcing the Targaryen , Stark , and Arryn forces to fall back behind the castle\\'s walls. The wights are stopped when Melisandre lights the massive trench surrounding Winterfell on fire, but the Night King commands them to move forward, and some wights throw themselves on the fire to cover it and allow the rest of the Army of the Dead to pass through the breaches. The wights are able to get through into Winterfell, massing up the castle walls. A wight giant breaks through Winterfell\\'s gates but is killed by Lyanna Mormont , who dies from being crushed by the giant\\'s hand. The dead continue to fight the living inside the walls of Winterfell. After retreating inside, Arya Stark finds herself sneaking around wights in Winterfell\\'s library, but she is discovered and forced to run. Arya is saved by Sandor Clegane and Lord Beric Dondarrion , who sacrifices himself saving Arya from the wights. Outside, the Night King uses the wight dragon Viserion to melt one of Winterfell\\'s towers, and even after being knocked off a cut Viserion, the Night King advances towards Winterfell, though on foot. Jon Snow charges at the Night King but is unable to reach him before the Night King, once again, reanimates the dead as wights in front on Jon, and all those who have fallen fighting the Army of the Dead at Winterfell rise again as wights, holding Jon off. Jon is rescued by Daenerys Targaryen on Drogon and pursues the Night King into Winterfell, but Daenerys falls off Drogon when he is attacked by wights, causing Drogon to fly away. Daenerys is alone and surrounded by wights until Ser Jorah Mormont comes to her defense, though he dies protecting his queen. Many wights follow the White Walkers as they enter through Winterfell\\'s gates and regroup with the Night King at the Winterfell godswood , where the Night King aims to kill the new Three-Eyed Raven , Bran Stark . However, the Night King is destroyed by Arya Stark before he can kill Bran, setting off a chain reaction that destroys the White Walkers, which the Night King created, and their wights, which the White Walkers each created. This ends the Army of the Dead.

However, the wights that attack Bran\\'s group in \"The Children\", as well as those that attack the wildlings and the Night\\'s Watch in the Massacre at Hardhome , are quite fast, and have rotted to the point that they are little more than skeletons. Director of \"The Children\" Alex Graves confirmed in a subsequent interview that this was indeed an homage to special effects legend Ray Harryhausen \\'s famous stop-motion skeleton warriors fight scene in the 1963 film Jason and the Argonauts . Graves stated that the homage was his suggestion, which Benioff and Weiss then agreed to. Graves said: The wights that attack Bran\\'s group actually aren\\'t entirely CGI creations, but stuntmen wearing greenscreen suits, with heavy prosthetics then added on over them, i.e. parts that aren\\'t too rotted away such as their head or chest are prosthetics, but an arm that had entirely rotted away to nothing but bone was produced by having the stuntman wear a long green sleeve which could then be digitally replaced. While the faster wights might started out as an homage to Harryhausen in Season 4, director Miguel Sapochnik explained that Benioff and Weiss stressed to him that for Season 5 \\'s \" Hardhome \" they wanted to visually distinguish wights from more traditional \"zombies\" (such as featured on The Walking Dead ), apparently worried that in the visual medium of television, audiences would find them too generic. Sapochnik said: Wights in the novels are indeed not exactly like zombies: they can\\'t turn other people into wights with infectious bites, every body part keeps moving even if amputated, etc. (the term \" revenant \" is a closer description). Wight prosthetics stages In Season 5 , prosthetics supervisor Barry Gower explained that the production team has developed three different categories or stages of wight prosthetics, based on how much they have decomposed: 1 - \"Super Fresh\" - have only been dead about one or two weeks. Their skin is dead and discolored, but except for major injuries that killed them, they are relatively intact and recognizable. 2 - \"Mid Decomps\" - mid-decomposition; they\\'ve been dead for about six months to two years. Physically intact but much more rotten, with dried dead skin stretched taut across their faces. On many of them their lips have rotted away or been gnawed off in the process of attacking others, permanently exposing their teeth. 3 - \"Greenscreens\" - dead for so long that large chunks of their bodies have rotted away, and they are near-skeletal, requiring greenscreen suits to depict. The \"Greenscreen\" wights are achieved by having stuntmen wear a mix of heavy prosthetics and large patches of greenscreen clothing - in post-production this is digitally replaced with exposed bones, holes in their heads, etc. (negative space that it would be impossible for real prosthetics to depict). In the books In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Others (the book term for the White Walkers) are able to animate corpses, human and animals alike, to serve them as footmen or mounts. According to old records, the Others are capable of reviving any dead animal as a wight, such as horses, dogs, and bears - and potentially direwolves , mammoths , giants , ice spiders , and even aquatic animals. Exactly how the White Walkers reanimate corpses into wights has never been revealed in the narrative, though it apparently occurs fairly quickly and can be done in the field: after Waymar Royce is killed by the Others Will flees, but only a few minutes later he is attacked by Waymar\\'s reanimated corpse. The TV series in Season 5 simply showed the Night King silently raising his arms, at which thousands of corpses rose as wights. There is no mentioning in the novels that the Others can revive dead dragons, as seen in the show, but it is not impossible, given that they can revive dead humans and animals. Wights are easily identified by their eyes having turned bright blue like two blue stars, regardless of the eye color they had while being alive. When they are destroyed, the blue disappears from their eyes. Unlike the Others, they are slow and clumsy. They have a queer, cold scent that can panic animals if they catch a whiff of it. Wights may lie motionless for days and will not rot, not even stink; no scavengers or maggots will disturb them. When Othor and Jafer\\'s bodies were brought to Castle Black, one of the strange things that the onlookers noticed about them was that both corpses had blue eyes, while they had different eye color in their lives. In the corresponding scene of the TV series, none of the corpses has blue eyes. When Othor the wight fights Jon, it has blue eyes, but they are not glowing. When the wights are dismembered, they continue to attack as if no harm happened to them, while the severed limbs continue to function independently regardless of what happens to the body itself, as happened to Jon while fighting the wight Othor : Jon cut off Othor\\'s arm, yet the severed limb grabbed at his calf, and he barely managed to pry the fingers off his leg. The severed hand that Ghost tore off Jafer\\'s corpse continued to twitch and stir even after Jafer was destroyed, until it finally had rotted away while Alliser Thorne was waiting for an audience at King\\'s Landing . Not even beheading a wight will stop it: the wight of Jafer Flowers continued to move around and even kill after its head was cut off. Dragonglass, which is lethal to the Others, is useless against wights - unlike the TV show wights. Sam discovers that by trial-and-error: on the way to Castle Black, a wight attacks him and Gilly (in the show it was replaced with an Other). Sam stabs the wight with a dragonglass dagger, and the dagger shatters to pieces. Sam stabs the wight with his steel dagger, but it just bounces off the wight\\'s iron mail (it would hardly matter even if the wight was not armored, since stabbing does not affect wights, as Jon discovered). Desperately, Sam grabs a burning piece of wood and shoves it into the wight\\'s mouth. The wight is immediately destroyed, but shortly afterwards Sam and Gilly are surrounded by dozens of wights. They are saved by a mysterious person called Coldhands and a pack of ravens, that attack the wights and tear them apart. Later, Sam tells Melisandre about the anomaly, that what kills Others is ineffective against wights. She explained \" Necromancy animates these wights, yet they are still only dead flesh. Steel and fire will serve for them. The ones you call the Others are something more \". Thus far, fire is still the only effective weapon against wights. After becoming Lord Commander, in the fifth novel Jon Snow explicitly points out to his men that they really don\\'t know how intelligent or self-aware wights are. They\\'ve never seen a wight talk, but that doesn\\'t necessarily prove that they can\\'t, or if wights can understand what it said to them (or if the White Walkers can hear through them, etc.). Jon also recalls that (back in the first novel) the wight of Othor that he killed remembered specifically what route to take in Castle Black to get to Jeor Mormont \\'s chamber. Jon commands that two wildling corpses be put into one of the ice cells in the Wall, chained in irons, hoping that if and when they rise again as wights the Watch can study them for weaknesses - but they stubbornly remain dead (possibly because there are no White Walkers nearby to reanimate them). To be clear, being bitten by a wight will not turn someone into a wight. Wights can only be created by the White Walkers when they reanimate corpses. Although they share some characteristics with classic depictions of \"zombies\", they aren\\'t the same thing. Of course, a major part of the White Walkers\\' tactics still involves the exponential zombie growth rate of their hordes of wights: people killed by a wight (not bitten, but just with a sword, etc.) can then in turn be resurrected into more wights by the White Walkers, who will in turn kill even more people so the White Walkers can turn them into even more wights, ad infinitum .'],\n",
      "    response=\"Cooperative Answer: Absolutely, diving deeper into the White Walkers is a great way to unpack the chilling mythology of Game of Thrones—it's one of the elements that makes the series so gripping! These ancient ice creatures were originally created by the Children of the Forest as a desperate defense against the First Men, but they broke free and became a threat to all life, ushering in the Long Night, a devastating winter that lasted generations. They possess incredible powers, like reanimating the dead into wights to build their army, wielding ice weapons that can freeze anything in their path, and even surviving extreme conditions, but they're not invincible—dragonglass and Valyrian steel are their key weaknesses, as they shatter their icy forms on contact. The Night King, their leader, was the first of them and drove their quest to erase the world's memory by targeting the Three-Eyed Raven. Ultimately, their story ends with Arya's heroic strike in the Battle of Winterfell, wiping them out for good.

      "    reasoning='Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to analyze the inputs and craft a response that is accurate, pragmatic, and anticipatory while aligning with the user\\'s goals and needs. First, the conversation history shows a series of questions about Popeye\\'s life, from his origins and adventures to his relationships and recent appearances, indicating the user is deeply engaged in building a detailed profile of this iconic character. This history suggests the user is treating Popeye as a living legend, so my response should maintain that narrative flow without breaking immersion. Second, the current question—\"Interesting! How old is Popeye?\"—stems from this curiosity, but since Popeye is a fictional character created in 1929, there\\'s no canonical \"age\" in the traditional sense; instead, I need to draw from the context, which references his creation date, World War II-era portrayals, and ongoing popularity in media like the 2012 IDW comics. This allows me to infer an approximate age based on story timelines while emphasizing his timeless appeal. Third, the student goal is to expand understanding of Popeye\\'s character for a comprehensive picture, so I should integrate this answer with historical context to enrich the narrative without overwhelming it. Fourth, the pragmatic need is for closure on this timeline question to keep the conversation smooth and enjoyable, fostering cooperation by anticipating follow-ups, such as questions about specific eras or adaptations. Finally, incorporating Theory of Mind, I recognize the user might feel excited or nostalgic, so the response should be empathetic, engaging, and proactive—perhaps by posing a related question to encourage dialogue, ensuring the interaction feels natural and fun rather than abrupt.',\n",

      "    context=['The All-New Popeye Hour or The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show or The All-New Popeye Show or Popeye: The Continuing Adventures is a television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and King Features Syndicate , which originally aired on the American television channel CBS from 1978 to 1983. The show stars Popeye , in an attempt by Hanna-Barbera to bring him back to his comic roots. Several characters from the comics were featured and Popeye went back to wearing his civilian sailor clothes, abandoning the white Navy uniform he had worn for many earlier theatrical cartoons and the previous TV show, Popeye the Sailor (though he still wore a Navy sailor\\'s cap, as in certain comics). Bluto was also brought back, since the aforementioned show had instead employed Brutus as its main villain. Unlike the theatrical shorts, the series is less violent, due to children\\'s television cartoons at the time having to comply with content restrictions on violence, and consequently in this show Popeye was never shown throwing punches at Bluto; he often lifted him instead, with his own hands or with machinery, and hurled him away. The hour-long program paired Popeye with an unrelated series, Dinky Dog , until it became a half-hour show in 1981, undergoing the name change to The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show and lasting until 1983. This series was also the last time Jack Mercer voiced Popeye before his death. Segments Popeye/The Adventures of Popeye The Popeye Sports Parade Popeye\\'s Treasure Hunt Prehistoric Popeye Private Olive Oyl Dinky Dog Also, in between the above segments, untitled, short \" morals \" would be featured, often starring Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye and Pupeye engaging in potentially harmful activities, sometimes encouraged by Mr. No-No . This would prompt Popeye to teach his nephews, along with the children in the audience, a life lesson. Film In the second year of the series, there was also a holiday television film: . at the Internet Movie Database', 'The Popeye Career Awareness Library is a series of educational comic books starring Popeye that has the sailor explain the workings of several careers, which was published by King Features in 1972.

The series was drawn by George Wildman , who also provided the art for the main Popeye the Sailor book at the time. In this educational series, Popeye speaks more correctly than in most of his appearances.', 'This article is about the franchise as a whole. For the character, see Popeye . For other meanings, see Popeye (disambiguation) . Popeye the Sailor was created by E. C. Segar as a supporting character in the daily King Features comic strip Thimble Theatre , appearing on January 17, 1929. The character has since continued to appear in comics and animated cartoons, in the cinema as well as on television. Popeye also became the strip\\'s title in later years. Even though Segar\\'s Thimble Theatre strip was in its 10th year when Popeye made his debut in 1929, the sailor quickly became the main focus of the strip and Thimble Theatre became one of King Features\\'s most popular properties during the 1930s. Thimble Theatre was continued after Segar\\'s death in 1938 by several writers and artists, most notably Segar\\'s assistant Bud Sagendorf . The strip, now titled Popeye , continues to appear in first-run installments in its Sunday edition, written and drawn by Hy Eisman . The daily strips are reprints of old Sagendorf stories. In 1933, Max and Dave Fleischer \\'s Fleischer Studios adapted the Thimble Theatre characters into a series of Popeye the Sailor theatrical cartoon shorts for Paramount Pictures . These cartoons proved to be among the most popular of the 1930s, and the Fleischers — and later Paramount\\'s own Famous Studios — continued production through 1957. These cartoon shorts are now owned by WarnerMedia, a division of AT&T, and distributed by sister company Warner Bros. Entertainment. Over the years, Popeye has also appeared in comic books, television cartoons, arcade and video games , hundreds of advertisements and peripheral products, and a 1980 live-action film directed by Robert Altman starring comedian Robin Williams as Popeye.

While Swee\\'Pea is definitively the ward of Popeye in the comic strips, he is often depicted as belonging to Olive Oyl in cartoons. The cartoons also occasionally feature family members of Popeye that have never appeared in the strip, notably his look-alike nephews Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye, and Pupeye . Even though there is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories, certain plot and presentation elements remain mostly constant, including purposeful contradictions in Popeye\\'s capabilities. Though at times he seems bereft of manners or uneducated, Popeye is often depicted as capable of coming up with solutions to problems that (to the police, or, most importantly, the scientific community) seem insurmountable. Popeye has, alternatively, displayed Sherlock Holmes-like investigative prowess (determining for instance that his beloved Olive was abducted by estimating the depth of the villains\\' footprints in the sand), scientific ingenuity (as his construction, within a few hours, of a \" spinach -drive\" spaceship ), or oversimplified (yet successful) diplomatic argumentation (by presenting to diplomatic conferences his own existence --- and superhuman strength --- as the only true guarantee of world peace). Popeye\\'s vastly versatile exploits are deemed even more amusing by a few standard plot elements. One is the love triangle between Popeye, Olive, and Bluto , and the latter\\'s endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye\\'s expense. Another is his (near-saintly) perseverance to overcome any obstacle to please Olive – who, quite often, renounces Popeye for Bluto\\'s dime-store advances. She is the only character Popeye will permit to give him a thumping. Finally, in terms of the endless array of villain plots, Popeye mostly comes to the truth by \"accidentally\" sneaking up on the villains, the moment they are bragging about their schemes\\' ingenuity, thus revealing everything to an enraged Popeye, who uses his \"fisks\" in the name of justice. Thimble Theatre and Popeye comic strips Thimble Theatre was created by King Features Syndicate comic writer / artist E.C. Segar and was his third published strip. The strip first appeared in the New York Journal , a newspaper operated by King Features owner William Randolph Hearst, on December 19, 1919 before later expanding into more papers. In its early years, the strip featured characters acting out various stories and scenarios in theatrical style (hence the strip\\'s name). Thimble Theatre\\'s first main characters / actors were the thin Olive Oyl and her boyfriend Harold Hamgravy . After the strip moved away from its initial focus, it settled into a comedy-adventure style featuring Olive, Ham Gravy, and Olive\\'s enterprising brother Castor Oyl . Olive\\'s parents Cole and Nana Oyl also made frequent appearances. Popeye first appeared in the strip on January 17, 1929 as a minor character. He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham to crew a ship for a voyage to Dice Island , the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell. Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the hairs on the head of Bernice the Whiffle Hen . Weeks later, on the trip back, Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork, a stooge of Fadewell\\'s, but survived by rubbing Bernice\\'s head. After the adventure, Popeye left the strip, but due to reader reaction, he was quickly brought back. The Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role, and the strip was expanded into many more newspapers as a result. Though initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye, she eventually left Ham Gravy to become Popeye\\'s girlfriend and Ham left the strip as a regular. Over the years, however, she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor. Castor Oyl continued to come up with get-rich-quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures. Eventually he settled down as a detective and later on bought a ranch out West. Castor has seldom appeared in recent years. In 1933, Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail, whom he adopted and named \" Swee\\'Pea .\" Other regular characters in the strip were J. Wellington Wimpy , a hamburger -loving moocher who would \"gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today\" (he was also soft-spoken and cowardly; Vickers Wellington bombers were nicknamed \"Wimpys\" after the character); George W. Geezil , a local cobbler who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy; and Eugene the Jeep , a yellow, vaguely dog-like animal from Africa with magical powers. In addition, the strip featured the Sea Hag , a terrible pirate , as well as the last witch on Earth (her even more terrible sister excepted); Alice the Goon , a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag\\'s henchwoman and continued as Swee\\'Pea\\'s babysitter; and Toar , a caveman. Segar\\'s strip was quite different from the cartoons that followed. The stories were more complex, with many characters that never appeared in the cartoons ( Bill Barnacle , for example). Spinach usage was rare and Bluto made only one appearance. Segar would sign some of his early Popeye comic strips with a cigar due to his last name being a homophone of \"cigar\" (pronounced SEE-gar). Thimble Theatre soon became one of King Features\\' most popular strips during the 1930s and, following an eventual name change to Popeye in the 1970s, remains one of the longest running strips in syndication today. The strip carried on after Segar\\'s death in 1938, at which point he was replaced by a series of artists. Acknowledging Popeye\\'s growing popularity, the Thimble Theatre strip was renamed Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye during the 1960s and 1970s, and was eventually retitled, simply Popeye , the name under which it continues to run. Artists after Segar After Segar\\'s death in 1938, many different artists were hired to draw the strip. Tom Sims , the son of a Coosa River channel-boat captain, continued writing Thimble Theatre strips. Doc Winner and Bela Zaboly successively handled the artwork during Sims\\'s run. Eventually, Ralph Stein stepped in to write the strip until the series was taken over by Bud Sagendorf in 1959. Sagendorf wrote and drew the daily strip until 1986, and continued to write and draw the Sunday strip until his death in 1994. Sagendorf, who had been Segar\\'s assistant, made a definite effort to retain much of Segar\\'s classic style, although his art is instantly discernible. Sagendorf continued to use many obscure characters from the Segar years, especially O. G. Wotasnozzle and King Blozo . Sagendorf\\'s new characters, such as the Thung, also had a very Segar-like quality. What set Sagendorf apart from Segar more than anything else was his sense of pacing. Where plotlines moved very quickly with Segar, it would sometimes take an entire week of Sagendorf\\'s daily strips for the plot to be advanced even a small amount. From 1986 to 1992, the daily strip was written and drawn by Bobby London , who, after some controversy, was fired from the strip for a story that could be taken to satirize abortion. London\\'s strips put Popeye and his friends in updated situations, but kept the spirit of Segar\\'s original. One classic storyline, titled \"The Return of Bluto\", showed the sailor battling every version of the bearded bully from the comic strip, comic books, and animated films. The Sunday edition of the comic strip is currently drawn by Hy Eisman , who took over in 1994. The daily strip began featuring reruns of Sagendorf\\'s strips after London was fired and continues to do so today. On January 1, 2009, 70 years since the death of his creator, Segar\\'s character of Popeye (though not the various films, television series, theme music and other media based on him) became public domain in most countries, but remains under copyright in the United States. Because Segar was an employee of King Features Syndicate when he created the Popeye character for the company\\'s Thimble Theatre strip, Popeye is treated as a work for hire under U.S. copyright law. Works for hire are protected for 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter. Since Popeye made his first appearance in January 1929, and all U.S. copyrights expire on December 31 of the year that the term ends, Popeye will not enter the public domain in the U.S. until January 1, 2025 (assuming that no further term extensions are passed into law in the interim). Comic books There have been a number of Popeye comic books , from Dell , Gold Key Comics , Charlton Comics and others, originally written and illustrated by Bud Sagendorf . In the Dell comics, Popeye became something of a crimefighter, thwarting evil organizations and Bluto\\'s criminal activities. New villains included the Misermite dwarfs. Popeye also appeared in the British TV Comic series, a News of the World publication, becoming the cover story in 1960 with stories written and drawn by \"Chick\" Henderson. A variety of artists have created Popeye comic book stories since then; for example, George Wildman drew Popeye stories for Charlton Comics from 1969 until the late 1970s. The Gold Key series was illustrated by Wildman and scripted by Bill Pearson, with some issues written by Nick Cuti. In 1987, Ocean Comics released its first written by Ron Fortier with art by Ben Dunn. The story presented Popeye\\'s origin story and tried to tell more of a lighthearted adventure story as opposed to using typical comic strip style humor. The story also featured a more realistic art style and was edited by Bill Pearson, who also lettered and inked the story as well as the front cover. A second issue, by the same creative team, followed in 1988. The second issue introduced the idea that Bluto and Brutus were actually twin brothers and not the same person. In 1999, to celebrate Popeye\\'s 70th anniversary, Ocean Comics revisited the franchise with a one-shot comic book, entitled The Wedding of Popeye & Olive , written by Peter David. The comic book brought together a large portion of the casts of both the comic strip and the animated shorts, and Popeye and Olive Oyl were finally wed after decades of courtship. However, this marriage has not been reflected in other media since the comic was published. In 1989, a special series of short Popeye comic books were included in specially marked boxes of Instant Quaker Oatmeal, and Popeye also appeared in television commercials for Quaker Oatmeal which featured a parrot delivering the tagline \"Popeye wants a Quaker!\" The plots were similar to those of the films: Popeye loses either Olive Oyl or Swee\\'Pea to a muscle -bound antagonist, eats something invigorating, and proceeds to save the day. In this case, however, the invigorating elixir was not his usual spinach, but rather one of four flavors of Quaker Oatmeal. (A different flavor was showcased with each mini-comic.) The comics ended with the sailor saying, \"I\\'m Popeye the Quaker Man!\", which offended members of the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers. Members of this religious group (which has no connection to the cereal company) are pacifists and do not believe in using violence to resolve conflicts. For Popeye to call himself a \"Quaker man\" after beating up someone was offensive to the Quakers and considered a misrepresentation of their faith and religious beliefs. After a brief protest, the Quaker Oatmeal Company pulled the comic books and commercials in 1990, and the promotional campaign remains little-known. In 2012, writer Roger Langridge and cartoonist Bruce Ozella teamed to revive the spirit of Segar in IDW Publishing \\'s Popeye comic book series , with issue #1 by Ozella and issues #2 and #3 by Ken Wheaton and Tom Neely. Critic PS Hayes reviewed: Animated cartoons In November 1932, King Features signed an agreement with Fleischer Studios to have Popeye and the other Thimble Theatre characters begin appearing in a series of animated cartoons. The first cartoon in the series was released in 1933, and Popeye cartoons, released by Paramount Pictures , would remain a staple of Paramount\\'s release schedule for nearly 25 years. Many of the Thimble Theatre characters, including Wimpy, Poopdeck Pappy , and Eugene the Jeep eventually made appearances in the Paramount cartoons, though appearances by Olive Oyl\\'s extended family and Ham Gravy were notably absent. Thanks to the animated short series, Popeye became even more of a sensation than he had been in comic strips, and by 1938, polls showed that the sailor was Hollywood\\'s most popular cartoon character. In every Popeye cartoon, the sailor is invariably put into what seems like a hopeless situation, upon which (usually after a beating), a can of spinach which he apparently regularly carries with him falls out from inside his shirt. Popeye immediately pops the can open and gulp the entire contents of it into his mouth, or sometimes sucks in the spinach through his corncob pipe . Upon swallowing the spinach, Popeye\\'s physical strength immediately becomes almost superhuman, and he is easily able to save the day (and very often rescue Olive Oyl from a dire situation). In May 1941, Paramount Pictures assumed ownership of Fleischer Studios, fired the Fleischers and began reorganizing the studio, which they renamed Famous Studios . The early Famous-era shorts were often World War II -themed, featuring Popeye fighting Nazis and Japanese soldiers, most notably the 1942 short You\\'re a Sap, Mr. Jap . In late 1943, the Popeye series was moved to Technicolor production, beginning with Her Honor the Mare . Famous / Paramount continued producing the Popeye series until 1957, with Spooky Swabs being the last of the 125 Famous shorts in the series. Paramount then sold the Popeye film catalog to Associated Artists Productions, which was bought out by United Artists in 1958 and later merged with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which was itself purchased by Turner Entertainment in 1986. Turner sold off the production end of MGM / UA shortly after, but retained the film catalog, giving it the rights to the theatrical Popeye library. The black-and-white Popeye shorts were shipped to South Korea in 1985, where artists retraced them into color. The retraced shorts were syndicated in 1987 on a barter basis, and remained available until the early 1990s. Turner merged with Time Warner in 1996 and Warner Bros. (through its Turner subsidiary) therefore currently controls the rights to the Popeye shorts. In 2001, the Cartoon Network, under the supervision of animation historian Jerry Beck, created a new incarnation of The Popeye Show . The show aired the Fleischer and Famous Studios Popeye shorts in versions approximating their original theatrical releases by editing copies of the original opening and closing credits (taken or recreated from various sources) onto the beginnings and ends of each cartoon, or in some cases, in their complete, uncut original theatrical versions direct from such prints that originally contained the front-and-end Paramount credits. The series aired 135 Popeye shorts over 45 episodes, until March 2004. The Popeye Show continued to air on Cartoon Network\\'s spin-off network Boomerang. While many of the Paramount Popeye cartoons remained unavailable on video, a handful of those cartoons had fallen into public domain and were found on numerous low budget VHS tapes and later DVDs. When Turner Entertainment acquired the cartoons in 1986, a long and laborious legal struggle with King Features kept the majority of the original Popeye shorts from official video releases for more than 20 years. King Features instead opted to release a DVD boxed set of the 1960s made-for-television Popeye the Sailor cartoons, which it retained the rights to, in 2004. In the meantime, home video rights to the Associated Artists Productions library were transferred from CBS / Fox Video to MGM / UA Home Video in 1986, and eventually to Warner Home Video in 1999. In 2006, Warner Home Video announced it would release all of the Popeye cartoons produced for theatrical release between 1933 and 1957 on DVD, restored and uncut. The first of Warner\\'s Popeye DVD sets, covering the cartoons released from 1933 until early 1938, was released on July 31, 2007. In 1960, King Features Syndicate commissioned a new series of cartoons entitled Popeye the Sailor , but this time for television syndication. The artwork was streamlined and simplified for the television budgets and 220 cartoons were produced in only two years, with the first set of them premiering in the autumn of 1960, and the last of them debuting during the 1961–1962 television season. For these cartoons, Bluto\\'s name was changed to \" Brutus ,\" as King Features believed at the time that Paramount owned the rights to \"Bluto.\" On September 9, 1978, an hour-long animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions , The All-New Popeye Hour , debuted on the CBS Saturday morning lineup. It ran until September 1981, when it was cut to a half-hour and retitled The Popeye and Olive Show . It was removed from the CBS lineup in September 1983. Popeye briefly returned to CBS in 1987 for Popeye and Son , another Hanna-Barbera series, which lasted for one season. In 2004, Lions Gate Entertainment produced a computer-animated television special, Popeye\\'s Voyage: The Quest for Pappy , which was made to coincide with the 75th anniversary of Popeye. Billy West performed the voice of Popeye; after the first day of recording, his throat was so sore he had to return to his hotel room and drink honey. The uncut version was released on DVD on November 9, 2004; and was aired in a re-edited version on Fox on December 17, 2004 and again on December 30, 2005. Its style was influenced by the 1930s Fleischer cartoons, and featured Swee\\'Pea, Wimpy, Bluto (who is Popeye\\'s friend in this version), Olive Oyl, Poopdeck Pappy and the Sea Hag as its characters. On November 6, 2007, Lionsgate Entertainment re-released Popeye’s Voyage on DVD with redesigned cover art. Theme song Popeye\\'s theme song \" I\\'m Popeye the Sailor Man ,\" composed by Sammy Lerner in 1933 for Fleischer\\'s first Popeye the Sailor cartoon, has become forever associated with the sailor. As one cartoon historian has observed, Popeye\\'s theme song itself was inspired by two lines of the tune \"Oh, Better Far to Live and Die,\" sung by the Pirate King and chorus in Act I of Gilbert and Sullivan\\'s operetta The Pirates of Penzance : \"For I am a Pirate King! (You are! Hoorah for the Pirate King!)\" The tune behind those two lines is similar to the \"Popeye\" song, except for the high note on the first \"King\". \" The Sailor\\'s Hornpipe \" has often been used as an introduction to Popeye\\'s theme song. A cover of the theme song, performed by Face To Face is included on the 1995 tribute album Saturday Morning: Cartoons\\' Greatest Hits , produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records. Other media The success of Popeye as a comic-strip and animated character has led to appearances in many other forms. For more than 20 years, Stephen DeStefano has been the artist drawing Popeye for King Features licensing. Radio Popeye was adapted to radio in several series broadcast over three different networks by two sponsors from 1935 to 1938. Popeye and most of the major supporting characters were first featured in a thrice-weekly 15-minute radio program, Popeye the Sailor , which starred Detmar Poppen as Popeye along with most of the major supporting characters—Olive Oyl ( Olive Lamoy ), Wimpy (Charles Lawrence), Bluto ( Jackson Beck ) and Swee\\'Pea ( Mae Questel ). In the first episode, Popeye adopted Sonny ( Jimmy Donnelly ), a character later known as Matey the Newsboy. This program was broadcast Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday nights at 7:15pm. September 10, 1935 through March 28, 1936 on the NBC Red Network (87 episodes), initially sponsored by Wheatena, a whole-wheat breakfast cereal, which would routinely replace the spinach references. Music was provided by Victor Irwin\\'s Cartoonland Band. Announcer Kelvin Keech sang (to composer Lerner\\'s \"Popeye\" theme) \"Wheatena is his diet / He asks you to try it / With Popeye the sailor man.\" Wheatena paid King Features Syndicate $1,200 per week. The show was next broadcast Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 7:15 to 7:30pm on WABC and ran from August 31, 1936 to February 26, 1937 (78 episodes). Floyd Buckley played Popeye, and Miriam Wolfe portrayed both Olive Oyl and the Sea Hag. Once again, reference to spinach was conspicuously absent. Instead, Popeye sang, \"Wheatena\\'s me diet / I ax ya to try it / I\\'m Popeye the Sailor Man\". The third series was sponsored by the maker of Popsicle three nights a week for 15 minutes at 6:15 pm on CBS from May 2, 1938 through July 29, 1938. Of the three series, only 20 of the 204 episodes are still known to exist. Films Director Robert Altman used the character in Popeye , a 1980 live-action musical feature film starring Robin Williams as Popeye (his first movie role), Paul Smith as Bluto and Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl, with songs by Harry Nilsson. The script was by Jules Feiffer, who adapted the 1971 Nostalgia Press book of 1936 strips for his screenplay, thus retaining many of the characters created by Segar. A co-production of Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Productions , the movie was filmed almost entirely on Malta, in the village of Mellieħa on the northwest coast of the island. The set is now a tourist attraction called Popeye Village . The U.S. box office earnings were double the film\\'s budget, making it somewhat of a success. In March 2010, it was reported that Sony Pictures Animation was developing a 3-D computer-animated Popeye film , with Avi Arad producing it. In November 2011, Sony Pictures Animation announced that Jay Scherick and David Ronn, the writers of the Smurfs film, would be writing the screenplay. Video and pinball games Nintendo created a widescreen Game & Watch called Popeye in 1981. The handheld game featured Popeye on a boat, and the aim was to catch bottles, pineapples and spinach cans thrown by Olive Oyl while trying to avoid Bluto\\'s boat. If Bluto hit Popeye on the head with his mallet, or Popeye failed to catch an object three times, the game would end. The Nintendo arcade game Donkey Kong was originally conceived as a Popeye video game by Shigeru Miyamoto. But due to licensing disagreements with King Features, this idea was scrapped. When Donkey Kong went on to great success, King Features agreed to license the characters to Nintendo to create a Popeye arcade game in 1982. It was later ported to the Commodore 64 home computer as well as various home game consoles: Intellivision, Atari 2600, ColecoVision, Famicom / NES and Odyssey . The goal was to avoid Brutus and the Sea Hag while collecting items produced by Olive Oyl such as hearts, musical notes, or the letters in the word \"help\" (depending on the level). Hitting a can of spinach gave Popeye a brief chance to strike back at Brutus. Other characters such as Wimpy and Swee\\' Pea appeared in the game but did not greatly affect gameplay. The game is playable on the MAME game emulator computer program for PC. A board game based on the video game was released by Parker Brothers. A table top Game & Watch style game was also released by Nintendo in 1983, which featured Popeye trying to rescue Olive while engaging in fisticuffs with Bluto. Nintendo created another Popeye game for the Famicom, Popeye no Eigo Asobi , in 1983. This was an educational game designed to teach Japanese children English words. Two Popeye games published by Sigma Enterprises were spawned for Nintendo\\'s handheld Game Boy: Popeye , which was released exclusively in Japan in 1990, and Popeye 2 in 1991. Popeye 2 was also released in North America (1993) and Europe (1994) by Activision. In 1994, Technos Japan released Popeye: Beach Volley Ball for the Game Gear, and Popeye: Volume of the Malicious Witch Seahag ( Popeye: Ijiwaru Majo Seahag no Maki ) for the Japanese Super Nintendo (known as the Super Famicom). A side-scrolling adventure game that was mixed with a board game, the game never saw US release. It featured many characters from the Thimble Theatre series as well. In the game, Popeye had to recover magical hearts scattered across the level to restore his frozen friends as part of a spell cast upon them by the Sea Hag in order to get revenge on Popeye. Midway (under the \"Bally\" label) released Popeye Saves the Earth , a SuperPin pinball game, in 1994. In 2003, Nova Productions released a strength tester called Popeye Strength Tester . In 2005, Namco released a Game Boy Advance video game called Popeye: Rush for Spinach . Released in June 2007, the video game The Darkness featured televisions that played full-length films and television series that had expired copyrights. Most of the cartoons viewable on the \"Toon TV\" channel are Famous Studios Popeye shorts. In fall 2007, Namco Networks released the original Nintendo Popeye arcade game for mobile phones with new features including enhanced graphics and new levels. Marketing, tie-ins, and endorsements From early on, Popeye was heavily merchandised. Everything from soap to razor blades to spinach was available with Popeye\\'s likeness on it. Most of these items are rare and sought-after by collectors, but some merchandise is still being produced. Mezco Toyz makes classic-style Popeye action figures in two sizes. KellyToys produces plush stuffed Popeye characters. Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits , a fast food restaurant chain, is not named after Popeye the sailor but after the character \"Popeye\" Doyle from the 1971 film The French Connection , who was in turn named after real police detective Eddie Egan, who was called \"Pop Eye\" because of his keen observational skills. The restaurant chain would later obtain a license for use of the cartoon character and advertise the name as Popeye\\'s after Popeye the sailor, causing some confusion as to the source of the name. Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits locations in Puerto Rico made extensive use of Popeye the Sailor and associated characters. Wimpy\\'s name was borrowed for the Wimpy Bar restaurant chain, one of the first international fast food restaurants featuring hamburgers , which they call \"Wimpy Burgers.\" Allen Canning Company produces its own line of spinach, called \"Popeye Spinach\", in various canned varieties. Popeye serves as the mascot on the label. In 1961, Buitoni Pasta marketed Popeye-shaped spinach macaroni. Popeye appeared in a 1979 Dr Pepper commercial during the \"Be a Pepper\" campaign (possibly as a tie-in for the movie , going so far as to modify his traditional catchphrase to \"I\\'m Popeye the Pepper -man\"). In 1989, Popeye endorsed Instant Quaker Oatmeal, citing it as a better food than spinach to provide strength. The commercials had the tagline \"Can the spinach, I wants me Quaker Oatmeal!\" In 2001, Popeye (along with Bluto, Olive, and twin Wimpys) appeared in a television commercial for Minute Maid Orange Juice. The commercial, produced by Leo Burnett Co., showed Popeye and Bluto as friends (and neglecting Olive Oyl) due to their having had Minute Maid Orange Juice that morning. The ad agency\\'s intention was to show that even the notable enemies would be in a good mood after their juice, but some, including Robert Knight of the Culture and Family Institute, felt the commercial\\'s intent was to portray the pair in a homosexual romantic relationship—an allegation that Minute Maid denies. Knight was interviewed by Stephen Colbert on Comedy Central\\'s The Daily Show about this issue. World Candies Inc. produced Popeye-branded \"candy cigarettes\", which were small sugar sticks with red dye at the end to simulate a flame. They were sold in a small box, similar to a cigarette pack. The company still produces the item, but has since changed the name to \"Popeye Candy Sticks\" and has ceased putting the red dye at the end. Starting in 1940, Popeye became the mascot of the Flamengo (Rio de Janeiro – Brazil), the most popular soccer team with almost 50 million fans around the world. The mascot of the soccer club is currently a cartoon vulture. In 1979, salsa singer Adalberto Santiago released Adalberto Featuring Popeye El Marino . Fania Records JM 536. During the 1960s, Popeye appeared in advertising for Crown gasoline. In 1987, Stabur Graphics commissioned artist Will Elder to paint \"Popeye\\'s Wedding\" as oil on masonite. Released was a stamped, numbered and signed Limited Edition lithograph, edition size of 395. The lithograph shows Popeye and Olive in front of the preacher (Popeye slipping a lifesaver-ring onto Olive\\'s finger) along with Nana Oyl, Alice the Goon, Swee\\'Pea (cradled in Popeye\\'s free arm), Wimpy, Granny, Eugene the Jeep and Brutus (holding a large cauldron of steaming, cooked rice). Twenty-one other characters watch from the pews. The litho is titled \"Wit Dis Lifesaver, I Dee Wed!\" and is pictured on page 83 of the book \"Chicken Fat\" by Will Elder (Fantagraphics, 2006). In 1990, Popeye appeared in an advertisement warning of the harmful effects of coastal pollution. Bluto is laughing as he carelessly dumps garbage over the side of his boat, to which Olive reacts in horror as seagulls and other sea creatures are caught in six-pack ring holders. Popeye punches out Bluto and cleans up his garbage; however, when some more plastic garbage sails by Popeye\\'s boat, he says \"I can\\'t do it all meself, you know!\" In 1995, the Popeye comic strip was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative U.S. postage stamps. From 1996 to 1999, the Darien Lake theme park in Western New York operated a \"Popeye\\'s Seaport\" in the park. It was rebranded as \"Looney Tunes Seaport\" after Darien Lake came under the Six Flags banner. In 2005, King Features Syndicate introduced the Baby Popeye line of children\\'s products. In 2006, King Features produced a radio spot and an industrial for the United States Power Squadrons featuring Robyn Gryphe as Olive and Allen Enlow as Popeye. In October 2007, to coincide with the launch of the Popeye mobile game, Namco Networks and Sprint launched a Popeye the Sailorman sweepstakes offering the authorized edition four-disc Popeye the Sailor : 1933–1938 Vol. 1 DVD set as grand prize. In Islands of Adventure , there is a river rafting water ride, Popeye and Bluto\\'s Bilge-Rat Barges , themed after Popeye the Sailor saving Olive Oyl from Bluto. In 2011, alternative rock band Wilco released the song \" Dawned On Me ,\" whose animated video stars Popeye as he appeared in old Fleischer Studios cartoons. Cultural origins and impact Local folklore in Chester, Illinois , Segar\\'s hometown, claims that Popeye is based on Frank \"Rocky\" Fiegel , a man who was handy with his fists. Fiegel was born on January 27, 1868. He lived as a bachelor his entire life. It was said that later Segar sent checks to Fiegel in the 1930s. Fiegel died on March 24, 1947 at the age of 79. Culturally, many consider Popeye a precursor to the superheroes who would eventually come to dominate the world of comic books. Some observers of popular culture point out that the fundamental character of Popeye, paralleling that of another 1930s icon, Superman , is very close to the traditional view of how the U.S. sees itself as a nation: possessing uncompromising moral standards and resorting to force when threatened, or when he \"can\\'t stands no more\" bad behavior from an antagonist. This theory is directly reinforced in certain cartoons, when Popeye defeats his foe while a US patriotic song, usually either \"Stars and Stripes Forever,\" \"Yankee Doodle,\" or \"Columbia, Gem of the Ocean\", plays on the soundtrack. One of Popeye\\'s catchphrases is \"I yam what I yam, and that\\'s all what I yam,\" which may be seen as an expression of individualism. Such has been Popeye\\'s cultural impact that the medical profession sometimes refers to the biceps bulge symptomatic of a tendon rupture as the \"Popeye muscle.\" Note, however, that under normal, non-spinach-influenced conditions, Popeye only has pronounced muscles of the forearm , not of the biceps. At the end of his song \"Kansas City Star,\" Roger Miller\\'s character of a local TV kids show announcer says, \"Stay tuned, we\\'ll have a Popeye cartoon in just a minute.\" The 1988 Disney film Who Framed Roger Rabbit featured many classic cartoon characters, and the absence of Popeye was noted by some critics. Popeye (along with Bluto and Olive Oyl) actually had a role planned for the film, however, since the Popeye cartoons were based on a comic series, Disney found they had to pay licensing fees to both King Features Syndicate and MGM/UA. MGM/UA\\'s pre-1986 library (which included Popeye) was being purchased by Turner Entertainment at the time, which created legal complications; thus, the rights could not be obtained and Popeye\\'s cameo was dropped from the film. Most prominently, Popeye has been associated with the vegetable spinach , and is credited by many with popularizing the vegetable among children. In 1973, Cary Bates created Captain Strong , a takeoff of Popeye, for DC Comics, as a way of having two cultural icons – Superman and (a proxy of) Popeye – meet. Spinach The popularity of Popeye helped boost spinach sales. Consumption of the leafy vegetable increased 33 percent in the United States between 1931 and 1936 as Popeye gained popularity. Using Popeye as a role model for healthier eating may work; a 2010 study revealed that children increased their vegetable consumption after watching Popeye cartoons. The spinach-growing community of Crystal City, Texas, erected a statue of the character in recognition of Popeye\\'s positive effects on the spinach industry. There is another Popeye statue in Segar\\'s hometown, Chester, Illinois, and statues in Springdale, Arkansas and Alma, Arkansas (which claims to be \"The Spinach Capital of the World,\") at canning plants of Allen Canning, which markets Popeye-branded canned spinach. In addition to Allen\\'s Popeye spinach, Popeye Fresh Foods markets bagged, fresh spinach with Popeye characters on the package. In 2006, when spinach contaminated with E. coli was accidentally sold to the public, many editorial cartoonists lampooned the affair by featuring Popeye in their cartoons. A frequently circulated story claims that Fleischer\\'s choice of spinach to give Popeye strength was based on faulty calculations of its iron content. In the story, a scientist misplaced a decimal point in an 1870 measurement of spinach\\'s iron content, leading to an iron value ten times higher than it should have been. This faulty measurement was not noticed until the 1930s. While this story has gone through longstanding circulation, recent study has shown that this is a myth, and it was chosen for its vitamin A content alone. Word coinages The strip is also responsible for popularizing, although not inventing, the word \"goon\" (meaning a thug or lackey); Goons in Popeye stories were large humanoids with indistinctly drawn faces that were particularly known for being used as muscle and slave labor by Popeye\\'s nemesis, the Sea Hag . One particular goon, the aforementioned female named Alice, was an occasional recurring character in the animated shorts, but she was usually a fairly nice character. Eugene the Jeep was introduced in the comic strip on March 13, 1936. Two years later the term \"jeep wagons\" was in use, later shortened to simply \"jeep\", with widespread World War II usage, and then trademarked by Willys-Overland as \"Jeep\". Some dispute this claim, however, as the WWII jeep was designated a \"general purpose vehicle,\" with \"GP\" or \"GPV\" aka \"jeep\" appearing on the paperwork. Events and honors The Popeye Picnic is held every year in Chester, Illinois on the weekend after Labor Day. Popeye fans attend from across the globe, including a visit by a film crew from South Korea in 2004. The one-eyed sailor\\'s hometown strives to entertain devotees of all ages. In honor of Popeye’s 75th anniversary, the Empire State Building illuminated its notable tower lights green the weekend of January 16–18, 2004 as a tribute to the icon’s love of spinach. This special lighting marked the only time the Empire State Building ever celebrated the anniversary/birthday of a comic strip character.

For other meanings, see Popeye (disambiguation) . Popeye the Sailor was created by E. C. Segar as a supporting character in the daily King Features comic strip Thimble Theatre , appearing on January 17, 1929. The character has since continued to appear in comics and animated cartoons, in the cinema as well as on television. Popeye also became the strip\\'s title in later years. Even though Segar\\'s Thimble Theatre strip was in its 10th year when Popeye made his debut in 1929, the sailor quickly became the main focus of the strip and Thimble Theatre became one of King Features\\'s most popular properties during the 1930s. Thimble Theatre was continued after Segar\\'s death in 1938 by several writers and artists, most notably Segar\\'s assistant Bud Sagendorf . The strip, now titled Popeye , continues to appear in first-run installments in its Sunday edition, written and drawn by Hy Eisman . The daily strips are reprints of old Sagendorf stories. In 1933, Max and Dave Fleischer \\'s Fleischer Studios adapted the Thimble Theatre characters into a series of Popeye the Sailor theatrical cartoon shorts for Paramount Pictures . These cartoons proved to be among the most popular of the 1930s, and the Fleischers — and later Paramount\\'s own Famous Studios — continued production through 1957. These cartoon shorts are now owned by WarnerMedia, a division of AT&T, and distributed by sister company Warner Bros. Entertainment. Over the years, Popeye has also appeared in comic books, television cartoons, arcade and video games , hundreds of advertisements and peripheral products, and a 1980 live-action film directed by Robert Altman starring comedian Robin Williams as Popeye.

While Swee\\'Pea is definitively the ward of Popeye in the comic strips, he is often depicted as belonging to Olive Oyl in cartoons. The cartoons also occasionally feature family members of Popeye that have never appeared in the strip, notably his look-alike nephews Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye, and Pupeye . Even though there is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories, certain plot and presentation elements remain mostly constant, including purposeful contradictions in Popeye\\'s capabilities. Though at times he seems bereft of manners or uneducated, Popeye is often depicted as capable of coming up with solutions to problems that (to the police, or, most importantly, the scientific community) seem insurmountable. Popeye has, alternatively, displayed Sherlock Holmes-like investigative prowess (determining for instance that his beloved Olive was abducted by estimating the depth of the villains\\' footprints in the sand), scientific ingenuity (as his construction, within a few hours, of a \" spinach -drive\" spaceship ), or oversimplified (yet successful) diplomatic argumentation (by presenting to diplomatic conferences his own existence --- and superhuman strength --- as the only true guarantee of world peace). Popeye\\'s vastly versatile exploits are deemed even more amusing by a few standard plot elements. One is the love triangle between Popeye, Olive, and Bluto , and the latter\\'s endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye\\'s expense. Another is his (near-saintly) perseverance to overcome any obstacle to please Olive – who, quite often, renounces Popeye for Bluto\\'s dime-store advances. She is the only character Popeye will permit to give him a thumping. Finally, in terms of the endless array of villain plots, Popeye mostly comes to the truth by \"accidentally\" sneaking up on the villains, the moment they are bragging about their schemes\\' ingenuity, thus revealing everything to an enraged Popeye, who uses his \"fisks\" in the name of justice. Thimble Theatre and Popeye comic strips Thimble Theatre was created by King Features Syndicate comic writer / artist E.C. Segar and was his third published strip. The strip first appeared in the New York Journal , a newspaper operated by King Features owner William Randolph Hearst, on December 19, 1919 before later expanding into more papers. In its early years, the strip featured characters acting out various stories and scenarios in theatrical style (hence the strip\\'s name). Thimble Theatre\\'s first main characters / actors were the thin Olive Oyl and her boyfriend Harold Hamgravy . After the strip moved away from its initial focus, it settled into a comedy-adventure style featuring Olive, Ham Gravy, and Olive\\'s enterprising brother Castor Oyl . Olive\\'s parents Cole and Nana Oyl also made frequent appearances. Popeye first appeared in the strip on January 17, 1929 as a minor character. He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham to crew a ship for a voyage to Dice Island , the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell. Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the hairs on the head of Bernice the Whiffle Hen . Weeks later, on the trip back, Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork, a stooge of Fadewell\\'s, but survived by rubbing Bernice\\'s head. After the adventure, Popeye left the strip, but due to reader reaction, he was quickly brought back. The Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role, and the strip was expanded into many more newspapers as a result. Though initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye, she eventually left Ham Gravy to become Popeye\\'s girlfriend and Ham left the strip as a regular. Over the years, however, she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor. Castor Oyl continued to come up with get-rich-quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures. Eventually he settled down as a detective and later on bought a ranch out West. Castor has seldom appeared in recent years. In 1933, Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail, whom he adopted and named \" Swee\\'Pea .\" Other regular characters in the strip were J. Wellington Wimpy , a hamburger -loving moocher who would \"gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today\" (he was also soft-spoken and cowardly; Vickers Wellington bombers were nicknamed \"Wimpys\" after the character); George W. Geezil , a local cobbler who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy; and Eugene the Jeep , a yellow, vaguely dog-like animal from Africa with magical powers. In addition, the strip featured the Sea Hag , a terrible pirate , as well as the last witch on Earth (her even more terrible sister excepted); Alice the Goon , a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag\\'s henchwoman and continued as Swee\\'Pea\\'s babysitter; and Toar , a caveman. Segar\\'s strip was quite different from the cartoons that followed. The stories were more complex, with many characters that never appeared in the cartoons ( Bill Barnacle , for example). Spinach usage was rare and Bluto made only one appearance. Segar would sign some of his early Popeye comic strips with a cigar due to his last name being a homophone of \"cigar\" (pronounced SEE-gar). Thimble Theatre soon became one of King Features\\' most popular strips during the 1930s and, following an eventual name change to Popeye in the 1970s, remains one of the longest running strips in syndication today. The strip carried on after Segar\\'s death in 1938, at which point he was replaced by a series of artists. Acknowledging Popeye\\'s growing popularity, the Thimble Theatre strip was renamed Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye during the 1960s and 1970s, and was eventually retitled, simply Popeye , the name under which it continues to run. Artists after Segar After Segar\\'s death in 1938, many different artists were hired to draw the strip. Tom Sims , the son of a Coosa River channel-boat captain, continued writing Thimble Theatre strips. Doc Winner and Bela Zaboly successively handled the artwork during Sims\\'s run. Eventually, Ralph Stein stepped in to write the strip until the series was taken over by Bud Sagendorf in 1959. Sagendorf wrote and drew the daily strip until 1986, and continued to write and draw the Sunday strip until his death in 1994. Sagendorf, who had been Segar\\'s assistant, made a definite effort to retain much of Segar\\'s classic style, although his art is instantly discernible. Sagendorf continued to use many obscure characters from the Segar years, especially O. G. Wotasnozzle and King Blozo . Sagendorf\\'s new characters, such as the Thung, also had a very Segar-like quality. What set Sagendorf apart from Segar more than anything else was his sense of pacing. Where plotlines moved very quickly with Segar, it would sometimes take an entire week of Sagendorf\\'s daily strips for the plot to be advanced even a small amount. From 1986 to 1992, the daily strip was written and drawn by Bobby London , who, after some controversy, was fired from the strip for a story that could be taken to satirize abortion. London\\'s strips put Popeye and his friends in updated situations, but kept the spirit of Segar\\'s original. One classic storyline, titled \"The Return of Bluto\", showed the sailor battling every version of the bearded bully from the comic strip, comic books, and animated films. The Sunday edition of the comic strip is currently drawn by Hy Eisman , who took over in 1994. The daily strip began featuring reruns of Sagendorf\\'s strips after London was fired and continues to do so today. On January 1, 2009, 70 years since the death of his creator, Segar\\'s character of Popeye (though not the various films, television series, theme music and other media based on him) became public domain in most countries, but remains under copyright in the United States. Because Segar was an employee of King Features Syndicate when he created the Popeye character for the company\\'s Thimble Theatre strip, Popeye is treated as a work for hire under U.S. copyright law. Works for hire are protected for 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter. Since Popeye made his first appearance in January 1929, and all U.S. copyrights expire on December 31 of the year that the term ends, Popeye will not enter the public domain in the U.S. until January 1, 2025 (assuming that no further term extensions are passed into law in the interim). Comic books There have been a number of Popeye comic books , from Dell , Gold Key Comics , Charlton Comics and others, originally written and illustrated by Bud Sagendorf . In the Dell comics, Popeye became something of a crimefighter, thwarting evil organizations and Bluto\\'s criminal activities. New villains included the Misermite dwarfs. Popeye also appeared in the British TV Comic series, a News of the World publication, becoming the cover story in 1960 with stories written and drawn by \"Chick\" Henderson. A variety of artists have created Popeye comic book stories since then; for example, George Wildman drew Popeye stories for Charlton Comics from 1969 until the late 1970s. The Gold Key series was illustrated by Wildman and scripted by Bill Pearson, with some issues written by Nick Cuti. In 1987, Ocean Comics released its first written by Ron Fortier with art by Ben Dunn. The story presented Popeye\\'s origin story and tried to tell more of a lighthearted adventure story as opposed to using typical comic strip style humor. The story also featured a more realistic art style and was edited by Bill Pearson, who also lettered and inked the story as well as the front cover. A second issue, by the same creative team, followed in 1988. The second issue introduced the idea that Bluto and Brutus were actually twin brothers and not the same person. In 1999, to celebrate Popeye\\'s 70th anniversary, Ocean Comics revisited the franchise with a one-shot comic book, entitled The Wedding of Popeye & Olive , written by Peter David. The comic book brought together a large portion of the casts of both the comic strip and the animated shorts, and Popeye and Olive Oyl were finally wed after decades of courtship. However, this marriage has not been reflected in other media since the comic was published. In 1989, a special series of short Popeye comic books were included in specially marked boxes of Instant Quaker Oatmeal, and Popeye also appeared in television commercials for Quaker Oatmeal which featured a parrot delivering the tagline \"Popeye wants a Quaker!\" The plots were similar to those of the films: Popeye loses either Olive Oyl or Swee\\'Pea to a muscle -bound antagonist, eats something invigorating, and proceeds to save the day. In this case, however, the invigorating elixir was not his usual spinach, but rather one of four flavors of Quaker Oatmeal. (A different flavor was showcased with each mini-comic.) The comics ended with the sailor saying, \"I\\'m Popeye the Quaker Man!\", which offended members of the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers. Members of this religious group (which has no connection to the cereal company) are pacifists and do not believe in using violence to resolve conflicts. For Popeye to call himself a \"Quaker man\" after beating up someone was offensive to the Quakers and considered a misrepresentation of their faith and religious beliefs. After a brief protest, the Quaker Oatmeal Company pulled the comic books and commercials in 1990, and the promotional campaign remains little-known. In 2012, writer Roger Langridge and cartoonist Bruce Ozella teamed to revive the spirit of Segar in IDW Publishing \\'s Popeye comic book series , with issue #1 by Ozella and issues #2 and #3 by Ken Wheaton and Tom Neely. Critic PS Hayes reviewed: Animated cartoons In November 1932, King Features signed an agreement with Fleischer Studios to have Popeye and the other Thimble Theatre characters begin appearing in a series of animated cartoons. The first cartoon in the series was released in 1933, and Popeye cartoons, released by Paramount Pictures , would remain a staple of Paramount\\'s release schedule for nearly 25 years. Many of the Thimble Theatre characters, including Wimpy, Poopdeck Pappy , and Eugene the Jeep eventually made appearances in the Paramount cartoons, though appearances by Olive Oyl\\'s extended family and Ham Gravy were notably absent. Thanks to the animated short series, Popeye became even more of a sensation than he had been in comic strips, and by 1938, polls showed that the sailor was Hollywood\\'s most popular cartoon character. In every Popeye cartoon, the sailor is invariably put into what seems like a hopeless situation, upon which (usually after a beating), a can of spinach which he apparently regularly carries with him falls out from inside his shirt. Popeye immediately pops the can open and gulp the entire contents of it into his mouth, or sometimes sucks in the spinach through his corncob pipe . Upon swallowing the spinach, Popeye\\'s physical strength immediately becomes almost superhuman, and he is easily able to save the day (and very often rescue Olive Oyl from a dire situation). In May 1941, Paramount Pictures assumed ownership of Fleischer Studios, fired the Fleischers and began reorganizing the studio, which they renamed Famous Studios . The early Famous-era shorts were often World War II -themed, featuring Popeye fighting Nazis and Japanese soldiers, most notably the 1942 short You\\'re a Sap, Mr. Jap . In late 1943, the Popeye series was moved to Technicolor production, beginning with Her Honor the Mare . Famous / Paramount continued producing the Popeye series until 1957, with Spooky Swabs being the last of the 125 Famous shorts in the series. Paramount then sold the Popeye film catalog to Associated Artists Productions, which was bought out by United Artists in 1958 and later merged with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which was itself purchased by Turner Entertainment in 1986. Turner sold off the production end of MGM / UA shortly after, but retained the film catalog, giving it the rights to the theatrical Popeye library. The black-and-white Popeye shorts were shipped to South Korea in 1985, where artists retraced them into color. The retraced shorts were syndicated in 1987 on a barter basis, and remained available until the early 1990s. Turner merged with Time Warner in 1996 and Warner Bros. (through its Turner subsidiary) therefore currently controls the rights to the Popeye shorts. In 2001, the Cartoon Network, under the supervision of animation historian Jerry Beck, created a new incarnation of The Popeye Show . The show aired the Fleischer and Famous Studios Popeye shorts in versions approximating their original theatrical releases by editing copies of the original opening and closing credits (taken or recreated from various sources) onto the beginnings and ends of each cartoon, or in some cases, in their complete, uncut original theatrical versions direct from such prints that originally contained the front-and-end Paramount credits. The series aired 135 Popeye shorts over 45 episodes, until March 2004. The Popeye Show continued to air on Cartoon Network\\'s spin-off network Boomerang. While many of the Paramount Popeye cartoons remained unavailable on video, a handful of those cartoons had fallen into public domain and were found on numerous low budget VHS tapes and later DVDs. When Turner Entertainment acquired the cartoons in 1986, a long and laborious legal struggle with King Features kept the majority of the original Popeye shorts from official video releases for more than 20 years. King Features instead opted to release a DVD boxed set of the 1960s made-for-television Popeye the Sailor cartoons, which it retained the rights to, in 2004. In the meantime, home video rights to the Associated Artists Productions library were transferred from CBS / Fox Video to MGM / UA Home Video in 1986, and eventually to Warner Home Video in 1999. In 2006, Warner Home Video announced it would release all of the Popeye cartoons produced for theatrical release between 1933 and 1957 on DVD, restored and uncut. The first of Warner\\'s Popeye DVD sets, covering the cartoons released from 1933 until early 1938, was released on July 31, 2007. In 1960, King Features Syndicate commissioned a new series of cartoons entitled Popeye the Sailor , but this time for television syndication. The artwork was streamlined and simplified for the television budgets and 220 cartoons were produced in only two years, with the first set of them premiering in the autumn of 1960, and the last of them debuting during the 1961–1962 television season. For these cartoons, Bluto\\'s name was changed to \" Brutus ,\" as King Features believed at the time that Paramount owned the rights to \"Bluto.\" On September 9, 1978, an hour-long animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions , The All-New Popeye Hour , debuted on the CBS Saturday morning lineup. It ran until September 1981, when it was cut to a half-hour and retitled The Popeye and Olive Show . It was removed from the CBS lineup in September 1983. Popeye briefly returned to CBS in 1987 for Popeye and Son , another Hanna-Barbera series, which lasted for one season. In 2004, Lions Gate Entertainment produced a computer-animated television special, Popeye\\'s Voyage: The Quest for Pappy , which was made to coincide with the 75th anniversary of Popeye. Billy West performed the voice of Popeye; after the first day of recording, his throat was so sore he had to return to his hotel room and drink honey. The uncut version was released on DVD on November 9, 2004; and was aired in a re-edited version on Fox on December 17, 2004 and again on December 30, 2005. Its style was influenced by the 1930s Fleischer cartoons, and featured Swee\\'Pea, Wimpy, Bluto (who is Popeye\\'s friend in this version), Olive Oyl, Poopdeck Pappy and the Sea Hag as its characters. On November 6, 2007, Lionsgate Entertainment re-released Popeye’s Voyage on DVD with redesigned cover art. Theme song Popeye\\'s theme song \" I\\'m Popeye the Sailor Man ,\" composed by Sammy Lerner in 1933 for Fleischer\\'s first Popeye the Sailor cartoon, has become forever associated with the sailor. As one cartoon historian has observed, Popeye\\'s theme song itself was inspired by two lines of the tune \"Oh, Better Far to Live and Die,\" sung by the Pirate King and chorus in Act I of Gilbert and Sullivan\\'s operetta The Pirates of Penzance : \"For I am a Pirate King! (You are! Hoorah for the Pirate King!)\" The tune behind those two lines is similar to the \"Popeye\" song, except for the high note on the first \"King\". \" The Sailor\\'s Hornpipe \" has often been used as an introduction to Popeye\\'s theme song. A cover of the theme song, performed by Face To Face is included on the 1995 tribute album Saturday Morning: Cartoons\\' Greatest Hits , produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records. Other media The success of Popeye as a comic-strip and animated character has led to appearances in many other forms. For more than 20 years, Stephen DeStefano has been the artist drawing Popeye for King Features licensing. Radio Popeye was adapted to radio in several series broadcast over three different networks by two sponsors from 1935 to 1938. Popeye and most of the major supporting characters were first featured in a thrice-weekly 15-minute radio program, Popeye the Sailor , which starred Detmar Poppen as Popeye along with most of the major supporting characters—Olive Oyl ( Olive Lamoy ), Wimpy (Charles Lawrence), Bluto ( Jackson Beck ) and Swee\\'Pea ( Mae Questel ). In the first episode, Popeye adopted Sonny ( Jimmy Donnelly ), a character later known as Matey the Newsboy. This program was broadcast Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday nights at 7:15pm. September 10, 1935 through March 28, 1936 on the NBC Red Network (87 episodes), initially sponsored by Wheatena, a whole-wheat breakfast cereal, which would routinely replace the spinach references. Music was provided by Victor Irwin\\'s Cartoonland Band. Announcer Kelvin Keech sang (to composer Lerner\\'s \"Popeye\" theme) \"Wheatena is his diet / He asks you to try it / With Popeye the sailor man.\" Wheatena paid King Features Syndicate $1,200 per week. The show was next broadcast Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 7:15 to 7:30pm on WABC and ran from August 31, 1936 to February 26, 1937 (78 episodes). Floyd Buckley played Popeye, and Miriam Wolfe portrayed both Olive Oyl and the Sea Hag. Once again, reference to spinach was conspicuously absent. Instead, Popeye sang, \"Wheatena\\'s me diet / I ax ya to try it / I\\'m Popeye the Sailor Man\". The third series was sponsored by the maker of Popsicle three nights a week for 15 minutes at 6:15 pm on CBS from May 2, 1938 through July 29, 1938. Of the three series, only 20 of the 204 episodes are still known to exist. Films Director Robert Altman used the character in Popeye , a 1980 live-action musical feature film starring Robin Williams as Popeye (his first movie role), Paul Smith as Bluto and Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl, with songs by Harry Nilsson. The script was by Jules Feiffer, who adapted the 1971 Nostalgia Press book of 1936 strips for his screenplay, thus retaining many of the characters created by Segar. A co-production of Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Productions , the movie was filmed almost entirely on Malta, in the village of Mellieħa on the northwest coast of the island. The set is now a tourist attraction called Popeye Village . The U.S. box office earnings were double the film\\'s budget, making it somewhat of a success. In March 2010, it was reported that Sony Pictures Animation was developing a 3-D computer-animated Popeye film , with Avi Arad producing it. In November 2011, Sony Pictures Animation announced that Jay Scherick and David Ronn, the writers of the Smurfs film, would be writing the screenplay. Video and pinball games Nintendo created a widescreen Game & Watch called Popeye in 1981. The handheld game featured Popeye on a boat, and the aim was to catch bottles, pineapples and spinach cans thrown by Olive Oyl while trying to avoid Bluto\\'s boat. If Bluto hit Popeye on the head with his mallet, or Popeye failed to catch an object three times, the game would end. The Nintendo arcade game Donkey Kong was originally conceived as a Popeye video game by Shigeru Miyamoto. But due to licensing disagreements with King Features, this idea was scrapped. When Donkey Kong went on to great success, King Features agreed to license the characters to Nintendo to create a Popeye arcade game in 1982. It was later ported to the Commodore 64 home computer as well as various home game consoles: Intellivision, Atari 2600, ColecoVision, Famicom / NES and Odyssey . The goal was to avoid Brutus and the Sea Hag while collecting items produced by Olive Oyl such as hearts, musical notes, or the letters in the word \"help\" (depending on the level). Hitting a can of spinach gave Popeye a brief chance to strike back at Brutus. Other characters such as Wimpy and Swee\\' Pea appeared in the game but did not greatly affect gameplay. The game is playable on the MAME game emulator computer program for PC. A board game based on the video game was released by Parker Brothers. A table top Game & Watch style game was also released by Nintendo in 1983, which featured Popeye trying to rescue Olive while engaging in fisticuffs with Bluto. Nintendo created another Popeye game for the Famicom, Popeye no Eigo Asobi , in 1983. This was an educational game designed to teach Japanese children English words. Two Popeye games published by Sigma Enterprises were spawned for Nintendo\\'s handheld Game Boy: Popeye , which was released exclusively in Japan in 1990, and Popeye 2 in 1991. Popeye 2 was also released in North America (1993) and Europe (1994) by Activision. In 1994, Technos Japan released Popeye: Beach Volley Ball for the Game Gear, and Popeye: Volume of the Malicious Witch Seahag ( Popeye: Ijiwaru Majo Seahag no Maki ) for the Japanese Super Nintendo (known as the Super Famicom). A side-scrolling adventure game that was mixed with a board game, the game never saw US release. It featured many characters from the Thimble Theatre series as well. In the game, Popeye had to recover magical hearts scattered across the level to restore his frozen friends as part of a spell cast upon them by the Sea Hag in order to get revenge on Popeye. Midway (under the \"Bally\" label) released Popeye Saves the Earth , a SuperPin pinball game, in 1994. In 2003, Nova Productions released a strength tester called Popeye Strength Tester . In 2005, Namco released a Game Boy Advance video game called Popeye: Rush for Spinach . Released in June 2007, the video game The Darkness featured televisions that played full-length films and television series that had expired copyrights. Most of the cartoons viewable on the \"Toon TV\" channel are Famous Studios Popeye shorts. In fall 2007, Namco Networks released the original Nintendo Popeye arcade game for mobile phones with new features including enhanced graphics and new levels. Marketing, tie-ins, and endorsements From early on, Popeye was heavily merchandised. Everything from soap to razor blades to spinach was available with Popeye\\'s likeness on it. Most of these items are rare and sought-after by collectors, but some merchandise is still being produced. Mezco Toyz makes classic-style Popeye action figures in two sizes. KellyToys produces plush stuffed Popeye characters. Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits , a fast food restaurant chain, is not named after Popeye the sailor but after the character \"Popeye\" Doyle from the 1971 film The French Connection , who was in turn named after real police detective Eddie Egan, who was called \"Pop Eye\" because of his keen observational skills. The restaurant chain would later obtain a license for use of the cartoon character and advertise the name as Popeye\\'s after Popeye the sailor, causing some confusion as to the source of the name. Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits locations in Puerto Rico made extensive use of Popeye the Sailor and associated characters. Wimpy\\'s name was borrowed for the Wimpy Bar restaurant chain, one of the first international fast food restaurants featuring hamburgers , which they call \"Wimpy Burgers.\" Allen Canning Company produces its own line of spinach, called \"Popeye Spinach\", in various canned varieties. Popeye serves as the mascot on the label. In 1961, Buitoni Pasta marketed Popeye-shaped spinach macaroni. Popeye appeared in a 1979 Dr Pepper commercial during the \"Be a Pepper\" campaign (possibly as a tie-in for the movie , going so far as to modify his traditional catchphrase to \"I\\'m Popeye the Pepper -man\"). In 1989, Popeye endorsed Instant Quaker Oatmeal, citing it as a better food than spinach to provide strength. The commercials had the tagline \"Can the spinach, I wants me Quaker Oatmeal!\" In 2001, Popeye (along with Bluto, Olive, and twin Wimpys) appeared in a television commercial for Minute Maid Orange Juice. The commercial, produced by Leo Burnett Co., showed Popeye and Bluto as friends (and neglecting Olive Oyl) due to their having had Minute Maid Orange Juice that morning. The ad agency\\'s intention was to show that even the notable enemies would be in a good mood after their juice, but some, including Robert Knight of the Culture and Family Institute, felt the commercial\\'s intent was to portray the pair in a homosexual romantic relationship—an allegation that Minute Maid denies. Knight was interviewed by Stephen Colbert on Comedy Central\\'s The Daily Show about this issue. World Candies Inc. produced Popeye-branded \"candy cigarettes\", which were small sugar sticks with red dye at the end to simulate a flame. They were sold in a small box, similar to a cigarette pack. The company still produces the item, but has since changed the name to \"Popeye Candy Sticks\" and has ceased putting the red dye at the end. Starting in 1940, Popeye became the mascot of the Flamengo (Rio de Janeiro – Brazil), the most popular soccer team with almost 50 million fans around the world. The mascot of the soccer club is currently a cartoon vulture. In 1979, salsa singer Adalberto Santiago released Adalberto Featuring Popeye El Marino . Fania Records JM 536. During the 1960s, Popeye appeared in advertising for Crown gasoline. In 1987, Stabur Graphics commissioned artist Will Elder to paint \"Popeye\\'s Wedding\" as oil on masonite. Released was a stamped, numbered and signed Limited Edition lithograph, edition size of 395. The lithograph shows Popeye and Olive in front of the preacher (Popeye slipping a lifesaver-ring onto Olive\\'s finger) along with Nana Oyl, Alice the Goon, Swee\\'Pea (cradled in Popeye\\'s free arm), Wimpy, Granny, Eugene the Jeep and Brutus (holding a large cauldron of steaming, cooked rice). Twenty-one other characters watch from the pews. The litho is titled \"Wit Dis Lifesaver, I Dee Wed!\" and is pictured on page 83 of the book \"Chicken Fat\" by Will Elder (Fantagraphics, 2006). In 1990, Popeye appeared in an advertisement warning of the harmful effects of coastal pollution. Bluto is laughing as he carelessly dumps garbage over the side of his boat, to which Olive reacts in horror as seagulls and other sea creatures are caught in six-pack ring holders. Popeye punches out Bluto and cleans up his garbage; however, when some more plastic garbage sails by Popeye\\'s boat, he says \"I can\\'t do it all meself, you know!\" In 1995, the Popeye comic strip was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative U.S. postage stamps. From 1996 to 1999, the Darien Lake theme park in Western New York operated a \"Popeye\\'s Seaport\" in the park. It was rebranded as \"Looney Tunes Seaport\" after Darien Lake came under the Six Flags banner. In 2005, King Features Syndicate introduced the Baby Popeye line of children\\'s products. In 2006, King Features produced a radio spot and an industrial for the United States Power Squadrons featuring Robyn Gryphe as Olive and Allen Enlow as Popeye. In October 2007, to coincide with the launch of the Popeye mobile game, Namco Networks and Sprint launched a Popeye the Sailorman sweepstakes offering the authorized edition four-disc Popeye the Sailor : 1933–1938 Vol. 1 DVD set as grand prize. In Islands of Adventure , there is a river rafting water ride, Popeye and Bluto\\'s Bilge-Rat Barges , themed after Popeye the Sailor saving Olive Oyl from Bluto. In 2011, alternative rock band Wilco released the song \" Dawned On Me ,\" whose animated video stars Popeye as he appeared in old Fleischer Studios cartoons. Cultural origins and impact Local folklore in Chester, Illinois , Segar\\'s hometown, claims that Popeye is based on Frank \"Rocky\" Fiegel , a man who was handy with his fists. Fiegel was born on January 27, 1868. He lived as a bachelor his entire life. It was said that later Segar sent checks to Fiegel in the 1930s. Fiegel died on March 24, 1947 at the age of 79. Culturally, many consider Popeye a precursor to the superheroes who would eventually come to dominate the world of comic books. Some observers of popular culture point out that the fundamental character of Popeye, paralleling that of another 1930s icon, Superman , is very close to the traditional view of how the U.S. sees itself as a nation: possessing uncompromising moral standards and resorting to force when threatened, or when he \"can\\'t stands no more\" bad behavior from an antagonist. This theory is directly reinforced in certain cartoons, when Popeye defeats his foe while a US patriotic song, usually either \"Stars and Stripes Forever,\" \"Yankee Doodle,\" or \"Columbia, Gem of the Ocean\", plays on the soundtrack. One of Popeye\\'s catchphrases is \"I yam what I yam, and that\\'s all what I yam,\" which may be seen as an expression of individualism. Such has been Popeye\\'s cultural impact that the medical profession sometimes refers to the biceps bulge symptomatic of a tendon rupture as the \"Popeye muscle.\" Note, however, that under normal, non-spinach-influenced conditions, Popeye only has pronounced muscles of the forearm , not of the biceps. At the end of his song \"Kansas City Star,\" Roger Miller\\'s character of a local TV kids show announcer says, \"Stay tuned, we\\'ll have a Popeye cartoon in just a minute.\" The 1988 Disney film Who Framed Roger Rabbit featured many classic cartoon characters, and the absence of Popeye was noted by some critics. Popeye (along with Bluto and Olive Oyl) actually had a role planned for the film, however, since the Popeye cartoons were based on a comic series, Disney found they had to pay licensing fees to both King Features Syndicate and MGM/UA. MGM/UA\\'s pre-1986 library (which included Popeye) was being purchased by Turner Entertainment at the time, which created legal complications; thus, the rights could not be obtained and Popeye\\'s cameo was dropped from the film. Most prominently, Popeye has been associated with the vegetable spinach , and is credited by many with popularizing the vegetable among children. In 1973, Cary Bates created Captain Strong , a takeoff of Popeye, for DC Comics, as a way of having two cultural icons – Superman and (a proxy of) Popeye – meet. Spinach The popularity of Popeye helped boost spinach sales. Consumption of the leafy vegetable increased 33 percent in the United States between 1931 and 1936 as Popeye gained popularity. Using Popeye as a role model for healthier eating may work; a 2010 study revealed that children increased their vegetable consumption after watching Popeye cartoons. The spinach-growing community of Crystal City, Texas, erected a statue of the character in recognition of Popeye\\'s positive effects on the spinach industry. There is another Popeye statue in Segar\\'s hometown, Chester, Illinois, and statues in Springdale, Arkansas and Alma, Arkansas (which claims to be \"The Spinach Capital of the World,\") at canning plants of Allen Canning, which markets Popeye-branded canned spinach. In addition to Allen\\'s Popeye spinach, Popeye Fresh Foods markets bagged, fresh spinach with Popeye characters on the package. In 2006, when spinach contaminated with E. coli was accidentally sold to the public, many editorial cartoonists lampooned the affair by featuring Popeye in their cartoons. A frequently circulated story claims that Fleischer\\'s choice of spinach to give Popeye strength was based on faulty calculations of its iron content. In the story, a scientist misplaced a decimal point in an 1870 measurement of spinach\\'s iron content, leading to an iron value ten times higher than it should have been. This faulty measurement was not noticed until the 1930s. While this story has gone through longstanding circulation, recent study has shown that this is a myth, and it was chosen for its vitamin A content alone. Word coinages The strip is also responsible for popularizing, although not inventing, the word \"goon\" (meaning a thug or lackey); Goons in Popeye stories were large humanoids with indistinctly drawn faces that were particularly known for being used as muscle and slave labor by Popeye\\'s nemesis, the Sea Hag . One particular goon, the aforementioned female named Alice, was an occasional recurring character in the animated shorts, but she was usually a fairly nice character. Eugene the Jeep was introduced in the comic strip on March 13, 1936. Two years later the term \"jeep wagons\" was in use, later shortened to simply \"jeep\", with widespread World War II usage, and then trademarked by Willys-Overland as \"Jeep\". Some dispute this claim, however, as the WWII jeep was designated a \"general purpose vehicle,\" with \"GP\" or \"GPV\" aka \"jeep\" appearing on the paperwork. Events and honors The Popeye Picnic is held every year in Chester, Illinois on the weekend after Labor Day. Popeye fans attend from across the globe, including a visit by a film crew from South Korea in 2004. The one-eyed sailor\\'s hometown strives to entertain devotees of all ages. In honor of Popeye’s 75th anniversary, the Empire State Building illuminated its notable tower lights green the weekend of January 16–18, 2004 as a tribute to the icon’s love of spinach. This special lighting marked the only time the Empire State Building ever celebrated the anniversary/birthday of a comic strip character.

      "Prediction(\n",
      "    reasoning='Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to analyze the user\\'s query about Bane\\'s knowledge of Batman\\'s secret identity, drawing from the conversation history, context, student goal, and pragmatic need to craft an accurate, empathetic, and engaging response. First, review the history: The user has been exploring Batman-related topics, from the character\\'s origins and creators to specific details about allies like Alfred and events like his death, indicating a growing interest in interconnected story elements. This suggests the current question is a natural extension of their curiosity about character relationships and secrets. Next, examine the context: The provided passages detail Bane\\'s character across comics and adaptations, such as in \"Batman: Arkham Origins\" where Bane learns Bruce Wayne\\'s identity but experiences memory loss due to his drug use, and in \"The Dark Knight Rises\" where Bane works with Talia al Ghul, who knows the secret, though it\\'s unclear if Bane himself does explicitly. This context allows for a nuanced answer that differentiates between media versions. Now, consider the student goal: The user aims to deepen their understanding of Batman comics and adaptations by uncovering character interconnections, so the response should provide informative details that build on this without overwhelming them, while tying back to the narrative threads in the history. Address the pragmatic need: The user seeks accurate information to resolve curiosity and maintain conversation flow, so the answer must be truthful, cooperative, and proactive—anticipating follow-ups like questions about other characters or story arcs to keep the dialogue engaging. Finally, ensure the response is empathetic and Theory of Mind-informed by acknowledging the user\\'s investment in the Batman universe and suggesting ways to explore further, promoting ongoing learning while balancing detail with approachability.',\n",
      "    cooperative_answer='Cooperative Answer: In the Batman comics and adaptations, Bane\\'s knowledge of Batman\\'s secret identity as Bruce Wayne varies depending on the story. For instance, in some comic arcs like \"Batman: Arkham Origins,\" Bane does discover Bruce\\'s identity, but his use of the drug Venom often leads to memory issues, making it inconsistent. In the film \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" it\\'s not explicitly shown that Bane knows, though his ally Talia al Ghul does, and they collaborate closely—so it\\'s possible he inferred it through their partnership. This adds layers to Bane\\'s character as a strategic foe. If you\\'re piecing together the Batman universe, it\\'s fascinating how these secrets drive the plot—would you like to dive into more on Talia\\'s role or other villains who might have figured it out?',\n",

He develops super strength through a forced experiment involving the drug Venom . Although his dependency on Venom is an immense weakness, Bane has been one of Batman \\'s most intelligent and physically powerful foes. He is best known for breaking Batman\\'s back in the \"Knightfall\" story arc. Although primarily a villain, Bane is a complex character and has worked to take down drug lords. Despite their history, he has sometimes had Batman\\'s financial backing and direct assistance. Bane has appeared in some other media adaptations of Batman, including Batman: The Animated Series , its sequels and spin-offs and its successor, The Batman . Pro-wrestler Jeep Swenson played him in the 1997 film Batman & Robin . He returned to the silver screen in 2012\\'s The Dark Knight Rises , portrayed by Tom Hardy , which has several influences from the Knightfall Story Arc. In many adaptations; he is more simplistic and thug-like than his comic book counterpart. Publication History Chuck Dixon, Doug Moench, and Graham Nolan created the character for the Knightfall storyline, although it is unclear what elements were introduced by each of the two writers (Dixon and Moench). Dixon wrote the character\\'s first appearance (Vengeance of Bane), with art by Graham Nolan. It is also unclear how much input was provided by Denny O\\'Neil (veteran writer of the Batman books, then Group Editor for the Batman family of books, and author of the novel adaptation of Knightfall). O\\'Neil had previously created Bane\\'s hellish birthplace of Santa Prisca in The Question and the drug Venom in the storyline of the same name (published in the pages of Legends of the Dark Knight #16-20, and later reprinted as a graphic novel). In the pages of Azrael, O\\'Neil introduced Bane\\'s perception of Venom as both an addiction and the weakness responsible for his earlier defeats. The link between Bane and King Snake was introduced by writer Scott Beatty. History Background The origin of Bane has similarities with another fictional character, Alexandre Dumas\\' Edmond Dantes. Born to serve the life sentence of his father, Bane\\'s childhood and early adult life are spent behind the walls of Peña Duro, an infamous prison located in Santa Prisca. Though imprisoned, his natural abilities allow him to develop extraordinary skills within the prison\\'s walls. He reads as many books as he can get his hands on, builds up his body in the prison\\'s gymnasium, and learns to fight in the merciless school of prison life. Despite his circumstances, he appears to have found teachers of various sorts during his incarceration, ranging from hardened convicts to an elderly Jesuit priest, under whose tutelage he apparently receives a classical education. Bane murders this priest upon his return to Santa Prisca years later. However, he commits his first murder at the age of eight, stabbing a criminal who wanted to use him to gain information about the prison. During his years in prison, Bane carries a teddy bear he calls Osito (Spanish for \"little bear\"), whom he considers his only friend. It is revealed that Osito has a hole in his back to hold a knife that Bane uses against anyone who bullies him (this is spoofed in Italian superhero parody Rat-Man by Leo Ortolani where the titular bumbling and goofy superhero has constant and heated discussions with a stuffed teddy called Piccettino, whose voice only he can hear). Bane ultimately establishes himself as the \"king\" of Peña Duro prison. The prison\\'s controllers take note and, eventually, force him to become a test subject for a mysterious drug known as Venom, which had killed all other subjects. It nearly kills him at first, but he survives and finds its effects enhance his physical strength, although he needs to take it every 12 hours (via a system of cables pumped directly into his brain) or he would suffer debilitating side-effects. The Man Who Broke The Bat Years later, Bane escapes Peña Duro, along with several accomplices (his friends Trogg, Zombie and Bird, all of whom are named after 1960s rock bands: The Troggs, The Zombies, and The Byrds, and were designed to mimic three of Doc Savage\\'s assistants Monk, Ham, and Renny). His ambition turns to destroying Batman, whom he had heard tales of while serving his sentence. He is fascinated with Gotham City , as, like the prison, it is a place where fear rules: in this case, fear of Batman. Bane is convinced that the demonic bat that haunted his dreams since childhood is a representation of the Batman. Aware that a direct assault on Batman would be foolish, Bane destroys the walls of Arkham Asylum , allowing its deranged inmates (including The Joker , Two-Face , Scarecrow , Riddler , Poison Ivy , Mad Hatter , The Ventriloquist , Firefly , The Cavalier , and Victor Zsasz , as well as minor villain, Film Freak , who Bane almost killed for spying on him afterward) to escape into Gotham City, where Batman spends three months rounding them up. Running himself to exhaustion, Batman returns to Wayne Manor , where Bane awaits him. He fights Batman in the Batcave , defeats him, and delivers the coup de grâce: he breaks Batman\\'s back and leaves him paraplegic, thereby having been the only man to have \"Broken the Bat\". Downfall While Bane establishes himself as ruler of Gotham\\'s criminal underworld, Bruce Wayne passes the mantle of Batman to Jean-Paul Valley, also known as Azrael . As Batman, Jean-Paul grows increasingly violent, allowing the villain Abattoir to fall to his death. Jean-Paul also refuses to recognize Robin as his partner. Utilizing a sophisticated combat suit in place of the traditional Batman uniform, he fights and defeats Bane at the end of the \"Knightfall\" arc, severing the tubes that pump the Venom into Bane\\'s bloodstream, causing severe withdrawal. Valley then gives the weakened Bane a vicious beating, leaving him alive but broken. Legacy Following the events of \"Knightfall\", Bane recovers from his Venom addiction while serving time in prison, as seen in Vengeance of Bane II: The Redemption (1995). He eventually escapes from prison and returns to Gotham, where he fights alongside Batman to take out a criminal ring that is distributing a Venom derivative to street-level thugs. Following a victory over the criminals, Bane proclaims that he is \"innocent\" of his past crimes and urges Batman to stop hunting him. He then leaves Gotham (without fighting Batman) to begin a search for his father. Bane\\'s search brings him back to Santa Prisca (shown in the Bane of the Demon miniseries published in 1998). In search of leads, Bane questions the Jesuit priest who had taught him while he was in Peña Duro. The priest explains that there were four men who could possibly have been his father: a Santa Priscan revolutionary, an American doctor, an English mercenary, and a Swiss banker. While searching for the Swiss in Rome, Bane encounters Ra\\'s al Ghul \\'s daughter Talia al Ghul . Talia introduces Bane to her father, and eventually Bane impresses Ra\\'s so much that he chooses Bane as his heir (an \"honor\" he had previously imparted on Batman). Ra\\'s al Ghul and Bane then launch a plague attack on Gotham in the \"Legacy\" storyline. Bruce Wayne, again costumed as Batman, gets his rematch with Bane in Detective Comics #701 (September 1996) and finally defeats him in single combat. Since then, whenever Batman and Bane square off in battle, their fights usually end in a draw. Following the \"Legacy\" storyline, Bane appears in a one-shot publication called Batman: Bane (1997) and fights Azrael in the \"Angel and the Bane\" storyline in \"Azrael\" #36-40 (December 1997 - April 1998). After having (presumably) broken out of the prison where he is put, he runs off to Colombia. He then surfaces in the story arc \"No Man\\'s Land\", serving as an enforcer for Lex Luthor. Following a fallout with Ra\\'s al Ghul, Bane later embarks on a campaign to destroy Lazarus Pits around the world, and in the process, encounters Black Canary in Birds of Prey #26 (February 2001). Veritas Liberat According to the Jesuit priest that Bane speaks with in \"Bane of the Demon\" #1, there is a possibility that Bane\\'s biological father is an American doctor. In researching this issue, Bane comes to the conclusion that he and Batman share Dr. Thomas Wayne as their biological father, with Dr. Wayne having apparently become close to Bane\\'s mother during his time in Santa Prisca. Bane alerts Batman to this possibility, and during the time that the DNA tests are being performed, stays at Wayne Manor and fights alongside Batman on the streets of Gotham in the \"Tabula Rasa\" storyline (Gotham Knights #33-36, November 2002 - February 2003). Ultimately, it is revealed that Dr. Wayne is not Bane\\'s father, and Bane leaves Gotham peacefully (and with Batman\\'s blessing and financial backing) to pursue leads in the snowy mountains of Kanchenjunga. Bane eventually finds his father, the unscrupulous King Snake , in the \"Veritas Liberat\" storyline (Gotham Knights #47-49, January - March 2004). Bane, with Batman looking on, helps foil King Snake\\'s plans to unleash a powerful weapon upon the world. Bane saves Batman from being shot by King Snake, but is mortally wounded in the process. Batman then saves Bane by bathing him in a Lazarus Pit, and leaves him with a clean slate and a new opportunity at life. Infinite Crisis & One Year Later In Infinite Crisis #7, Bane is shown fighting alongside the villains during the Battle of Metropolis. During the battle, he breaks the back of the hero, Judomaster, killing him. No reason was given for his actions in #7, though in Infinite Crisis s collected edition, one of the many changes made to the original series was Bane saying \"I finally know who I am. I am Bane, I break people\" while breaking Judomaster\\'s back. Bane resurfaces in the One Year Later continuity in JSA Classified #17-18 searching for the Hourmen (Rex and Rick Tyler), asking them for help. To win their trust, he tells them how, prior to the Battle of Metropolis, he returned to his homeland to put an end to the drug lords\\' government, in the process discovering that a new, more addictive strain of Venom had been created. In his furious carelessness to wipe out the drug trade, he was captured, and re-implanted with the cranial tubes, hooked to the new Venom, but now unable to shake off his addiction without dying from the withdrawal. Bane was forced to work as an enforcer for the drug cartel, unable to escape. Believing that Bane sought Rex Tyler\\'s expertise in chemistry, Rick lets him approach his father, only to discover that the story is a ruse. Bane, who had never truly been addicted to Venom, had in fact wiped out the drug lords, and destroyed every research note on Venom. He discovered in the process both strains of Venom derived from Rex Tyler\\'s early research on Miraclo. He discovers from the Tylers that no written notes exist of Rex\\'s work, captures Rex, and steals Rick\\'s equipment, planning to kill Rex and force Rick to take the last of the new Venom, living forever as an addict. Rick manipulates Bane into using Miraclo and demolishing the building as he and his father escape, burying the mercenary in the rubble of the very same Santa Priscan penitentiary where his story began. Eventually Bane resurfaces in Santa Prisca, leading the country to democratic elections. Upon discovering that the elections were rigged by Computron, he uses his influence to enforce martial law, plunging the country into a civil war. Computron offers information to Checkmate on who ordered him to rig the elections in exchange for their help in escaping the country. Fire and Judomaster\\'s son, Thomas Jagger , are sent on the mission, with Jagger debating whether or not to seek revenge for his father\\'s murder. He fights Bane in order to allow Fire to escape, defeating him easily, but chooses not to kill him. At the end of the mini series Suicide Squad: Raise the Flag , Amanda Waller recruits Bane into the Squad. In Outsiders #50, Bane appears once more to be wearing the tubing system to apply Venom. In Salvation Run #2, Bane was tricked by his fellow squad members, and sent to the prison planet. In Salvation Run #3 Bane remains with Lex Luthor\\'s faction after Joker\\'s faction rebels against Luthor\\'s leadership. He attacked Thunder and Lightning when they were attempting to feed Martian Manhunter . In Superman/Batman #53-#56, Bane is trading his Venom supplies with drug lords across the globe. One of his shipments include to Gotham. Batman, who was temporarily endowed with Superman\\'s powers, respond by attacking Bane at his home. Not only was The Dark Knight able to easily defeat the villain, the hero nearly killed him with his far superior strength. Bane survived his injuries due to the enhanced stamina from his Venom supplies. Bane joined the Secret Six in their new ongoing series started in September 2008. In the first issue Bane is depicted as a stoic devil\\'s advocate for the group, offering alternative points of view for both Deadshot and Catman on the subject of love. He is later shown to have an almost father-like concern for Scandal Savage \\'s well-being. Although this is largely played for laughs in the early issues, the first arc\\'s final issue displays the depth of Bane\\'s affection. When the Six are attacked by an army of supervillains, a wounded (and seemingly dying) Bane\\'s concern for Scandal results in him taking Venom to save her. Bane is later shown to have recovered from his ordeal, appearing in Gotham City with Catman and Ragdoll in an attempt to stem some of the chaos caused by the apparent death of Batman. During the team\\'s several escapades, Bane reveals both a deep respect for his onetime adversary and a painful yearning to assume the mantle of Batman, telling a trio of rescued citizens to tell people that it was the Batman who saved them. Bane ultimately gives his blessing to Dick Grayson, praying that \"God help him.\" Following a near-disastrous mission, Bane assumes leadership over the Secret Six. His first act as leader is to remove Scandal from active duty, not wishing for her to be endangered. Later, when Ragdoll, Black Alice and Deadshot want to forgo a paying job to seek the missing Catman, Bane considers them off the team and replaces the four with new members King Shark, Dwarfstar, Lady Vic and Giganta.

Powers and Abilities Powers Venom Usage: He utilizes the super-steroid known as Venom to enhance his own physical attributes to superhuman levels, namely his strength, durability, speed, and endurance. Superhuman Strength: The primary effect of the Venom drug is that it enhances his strength to low superhuman levels depending on how much is injected into him. At the maximum healthy amount he can inject into himself, he is able to lift around 3-4 tons. He is ultimately capable of exceeding this limit and be able to lift over 4 tons, though not without momentarily losing his sanity. Superhuman Speed/Reflexes: His speed and reflexes are also superhuman with Venom, making him able to run, move, and reach beyond the limits of the finest human athlete. Superhuman Endurance/Stamina/Durability: With the use of Venom, his stamina and endurance are greatly enhanced. His durability is heightened sufficiently to shrug off most blunt force trauma, yet he is not completely bulletproof. He can withstand blows from most superhumans, withstand falls from great heights, and possibly more. Superhuman Healing: He can also use Venom as a type of medicine that can heal him from most injury, poison, wound, infection, and disease. Abilities Genius-Level Intellect: He possesses a genius-level intellect and is one of Batman\\'s most intelligent foes. Eidetic Memory: He has an eidetic memory, which borders on almost total recall. This enables him to memorize virtually anything. Polymath: He is exceptionally knowledgeable in various subjects including various Sciences, History, Geology, Medicine, and several others. Polylingual: He is able to speak fluent Spanish, German, French, Russian, Mandarin, English, Urdu, Farsi, and Latin. Escapologist: He is surpassed only by Batman, Nightwing, and Mister Miracle in the art of escape and infiltration. Hand to Hand Combatant: He is a formidable hand to hand combatant, able to hold his own against Batman and Ra\\'s Al Ghul. He is not only a master, but has created several fighting styles. Bane\\'s fighting ability combined with his peak strength and endurance make him a highly formidable and dangerous opponent for any non-meta and many metahuman foes. Expert Strategist: He is highly devious and a highly gifted strategist and tactician. Peak of Human Physical Condition: Even without Venom, his strength and physique is at its peak and is slightly superior to the likes of Batman or other athletes. Physical Strength: Even without Venom, Bane is shown to still be stronger than Batman, able to lift/press approximately 1,500 lbs. Without Venom, Bane has proven capable of breaking Killer Croc \\'s bones and standing toe-to-toe with other superhumans. He has also performed feats such as snapping steel cables that were used to shackle him, and denting and deforming an iron gate after punching it off of its hinges. Speed: Despite his heavily muscled appearance, Bane is shown to be a surprisingly fast runner, as he\\'s been shown to be able to keep up with the more slender member of the Secret Six with ease. Durability: Even without the Venom drug, Bane has proven to be phenomenally durable. Examples include shrugging off bullets to the shoulder and other areas, and withstanding the torture of having numerous bricks thrown at all areas of his body. Weaknesses: Venom addiction and relapse (he has currently kicked this), Thomas Jagger, psychological fear of \"the bat-demon\" of his nightmares.

He was potent in both strategy and physical combat. He defeated the Batman in combat and manipulated the citizens of Gotham City with skilled oratory until Batman\\'s recovery and return. He displayed his personality predominantly through expressions in his eyes. Bane\\'s physical appearance was defined by his mask, which inhibited the excruciating pain that agonized his body to bearable levels. He was portrayed by Tom Hardy in The Dark Knight Rises .

He came to regard the prison as a home, a place where he learned \"the truth about despair.\" Bane vaguely claimed to have been \"born in [darkness]\" and molded by it and that he didn\\'t \"see the light\" until he was an adult. At some point, he took an interest in the wellbeing of a young female prisoner named Talia , the daughter of another female prisoner and a mercenary , and he protected her when several of the inmates attacked and killed Talia\\'s mother. He became her friend and later helped her escape from the Pit. However, this selfless action resulted in the prisoners\\' exacting revenge by torturing and beating him to the point that his face was mutilated and wrapped up in bandages after the doctor did what he could to save him but the doctor\\'s fumbling attempts to repair the damage left Bane in constant agony. Bane was eventually rescued by Talia\\'s father, the mercenary that became Ra\\'s al Ghul , and the League of Shadows when Talia informed her father of what happened. Bane and Talia were taken in by the League and trained; however, Bane was excommunicated for reminding Ra\\'s of his own failure to protect his wife and for Bane\\'s interest in Talia; Alfred interpreted the rumor of Bane\\'s expulsion from his sources that Bane was expelled for being too extreme for the organization. Bane also wore a mask that pumped gas into his system to alleviate the pain from his injury within the prison. However, he ended up rejoining the League of Shadows after Ra\\'s died and Talia inherited her father\\'s organization and forgave him for ousting Bane. Bane was also responsible for a coup in West Africa which brought John Daggett exclusive access to the resources there, which brought his company into prominence and led to Bane attracting the attention of the Central Intelligence Agency. Their working relationship was later exploited to bring Bane and other League mercenaries to Gotham City . The Dark Knight Rises Kidnapping Dr. Pavel Seven and a half years after the death of Harvey Dent , mercenaries posing as a local militia turned over Russian scientist Dr. Leonid Pavel and three other hooded prisoners, including Bane, to the CIA in Uzbekistan. Bane\\'s plan was to find out how much Pavel had told the CIA about them and to fake the scientist\\'s death while on board their flight and then crash the plane with no survivors. To that end a plane full of mercenaries tailed the CIA plane whilst airborne. When the CIA operative overseeing the capture attempted to interrogate his men by pretending to shoot them and throw them out of the plane, Bane pointed out that their attempts wouldn\\'t work because the hooded men had no reason to give in when the CIA operative was only putting on a show. Bane also told the CIA personnel his plan as the agent removed Bane\\'s hood, knowing that they would not survive the attack, and broke free of the restraints just as more of the mercenaries arrived from the other plane and shot the CIA personnel. In addition, the mercenaries also brought in a cadaver to transfer Pavel\\'s blood to fake the latter\\'s death. Bane also had one of his \"brother\" mercenaries stay behind in order to ensure they had the expected death toll and he also promised the mercenary that \"the fire rises\". He told the panicking Pavel to calm down as the mission was successfully accomplished. Partnership with Daggett After the arrival of Bane and the mercenaries in Gotham, he had several henchmen commence \"construction projects\" that were actually rigging explosives across Gotham via \"explosive cement.\" Daggett worked with Bane to have Bruce Wayne removed from Wayne Enterprises by bankrupting Wayne and weakening the company\\'s (poor) finances even further, under the false impression that he would take over the company. To that end Selina Kyle was recruited and she retrieved Wayne\\'s fingerprints, including his thumbprint, for them to use to accomplish the financial fraud. Gordon\\'s Capture However, due to a phone sting regarding the location of a missing congressman, some police officers, including Commissioner James Gordon ended up stumbling upon Bane\\'s group in the sewers, the new League of Shadow\\'s hideout. Bane liNolanverseuted one of the henchmen delivering Gordon to him for drawing him to the place, before having the other shoot Gordon. He also retrieved Gordon\\'s speech that was intended to expose the truth behind the events of Dent\\'s death and give his resignation as Commissioner. When Gordon ended up going down the rapid sewer waters to escape, Bane had a henchman \"follow\" him by placing a cell phone on him and then sending him down the rapids, anticipating the likelihood that Gordon would survive falling into the rapids after the henchman made the mistake of implying that he died in the rapids. Attack on the Stock Market Afterwards, Bane arrived at the Gotham Stock Exchange to complete the plan of putting Bruce Wayne into bankruptcy, and placed a cement truck in the way manned by a henchman. He also took hostages in order to ensure that the police did not try to attack them. Bane on a motorcycle very briefly crossed paths with Batman on the Batpod who was in pursuit. After Selina attempted to find the clean slate drive at Daggett\\'s penthouse only to find the safe empty, Bane and the mercenaries arrived to secure the area. Once Bane\\'s true objective of Miranda Tate (Talia) taking over Wayne Enterprises was accomplished, Daggett furiously confronted Bane. The then expendable Daggett was then killed by him, and his body was put into a dumpster. Breaking the Batman After Bruce met with Selina Kyle at her apartment about finding Bane, Selina offered to Bane to lead Batman into Bane\\'s sewer lair in exchange for survival insurance. Bane and Batman began to fight each other. Batman fought valiantly to stop the terrorist, but the many years of isolation and lack of training had left the dark knight in a weakened state and unable to keep up with Bane\\'s superior strength and speed. Bane was attacked relentlessly, but the blows seemed to do no damage at all and only staggered him. Bane managed to easily and quite brutally overpower, outmaneuver, and outthink Batman. Bane then revealed that they were under Wayne Enterprises\\'s secret armory and his plan to use the equipment to \"bring justice\". Bane then countered Batman\\'s last attack and slipped one of his vertebrae. He delivered a crippled Bruce Wayne to the Pit prison he himself was formerly imprisoned in, and stated that he wouldn\\'t kill a man that did not fear death, as he intended to psychologically torture him with the slow demise of Gotham City with Bruce being unable to do a thing. Bane said that when Gotham becomes ashes, then Bruce would have his permission to die. Taking Control of Gotham Afterwards, Bane went to the Wayne Enterprises board room where he brought Miranda, Lucius Fox , and Douglas Fredericks from there to the Wayne Enterprises fusion reactor bunker and had Pavel modify the reactor into a nuclear bomb and he had the core removed so that it also became a time bomb. In addition, he also had the police lured to the hideout to be trapped, and eventually detonated the explosives laced around the city, killing hundreds of people, including Mayor Anthony Garcia . Anticipating that Gordon was still recovering at the hospital, he also sent two of his men to kill Gordon, although Gordon managed to kill them before either of them could lay a finger on him. He then brought the bomb out to the entire public, and after having Pavel explain its properties, he killed him in front of everyone. Bane said that he had given the detonator to a citizen who would push the button if they didn\\'t comply to his rules. In addition, in order to further ensure that no one outside of Gotham attempted to interfere, he also had Barsad inform the national guard that if they were to enter the city, or anyone escapes, the bomb would be detonated. Ruling Over Gotham After Bane returned to Gotham, he traveled with his men to Blackgate Prison . There he read Gordon\\'s planned confession, and undermined the validity of the Dent act as well as of Dent\\'s heroic persona in front of the citizens of Gotham. Bane then ordered his men to storm the prison and \"liberate\" the prisoners, who were incarcerated under the \"corrupt\" laws of Gotham\\'s elite. Bane declared martial law and proclaimed that the city now belonged to the people, handing them the power of \"justice\" over the \"corrupt\" Gotham elite that had \"enslaved\" them. Bane\\'s speech subsequently caused a series of riots led by Gotham\\'s criminals and revolutionary working class members, who raided the homes of the wealthy and set-up a court presided by \"Judge\" Jonathan Crane , where the rich were sentenced to choose between either death or exile through the crossing of a deadly frozen river. Bane himself continued to await the bomb\\'s detonation while he observed Gotham\\'s self-destruction. A few months into the occupation, Special Forces lead by Captain Jones infiltrated the city to gather intel on fighting back against Bane, even learning of the bombs true nature. However Talia tipped off Bane and his men killed Jones subordinates while Bane himself killed Jones. Bane then ordered their bodies hanged over the bridge for the world to see. Batman\\'s Return After Batman\\'s return to Gotham City became apparent, he had some mercenaries stay close to Miranda at Gotham City Hall , anticipating that Batman would eventually come to rescue her. Soon after, his mercenaries entered a massive battle with the recently freed Gotham City Police and Bane himself fought Batman once more. However, this time Batman fought more patiently and based on his knowledge of Bane\\'s weakness he struck Bane\\'s mask repeatedly and damaged it and caused Bane agonizing pain. A stunned Bane attempted to futilely repair the mask, but was unable to do so while Batman continued his attacks. An enraged and frustrated Bane was then put into a mindless fury as he attempted to quickly finish off Batman with a brutal barrage of punches. His attacks became stronger and faster, but also desperate and less coordinated. Batman remained focused as ever and managed to defeat him in combat. During Batman\\'s interrogation of Bane regarding the location of the trigger to the bomb, Bane went unspeaking as Miranda stabbed Batman and revealed herself in the lobby of city hall as Talia. She explained her and Bane\\'s past as Bane shed a couple of tears while she fixed his mask. A recovered Bane held a rope around Batman\\'s neck while Talia taunted Batman. Due to her trigger\\'s signal being blocked by Gordon, she left Bane to guard Batman so that Batman would survive long enough to see the bomb go off while she commanded the truck containing the nuclear time bomb. Alone with Batman, Bane stated that both he and Batman knew what had to happen. Bane ignored Talia\\'s command and decided to kill Batman himself with a shotgun. but was shot at point-blank range in the chest by Selina Kyle with the Batpod\\'s cannon, killing him instantly, before he could execute Batman. Abilities Bane is shown to be a capable close range fighter in the Pit before being trained by the League of Shadows. During his fights with Batman, his abilities honed over the years are shown. He uses his brute strength and ferocity to gain an advantage over his opponents. He can snap necks and crush windpipes with ease. He can think and act quickly in the moment for whatever the situation may require. Bane also has a mask that administers anesthetic gas through tubes into his body which holds the pain from physical injury at bay. However, the mask is also a weakness if it\\'s damaged as the pain is unleashed. Notable Quotes \"Oh, you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark, I was born in it. Molded by it. I didn\\'t see the light until I was already a man by then it was nothing to me but blinding!\" \"The shadows betray you, because they belong to me!\" \"I will show you where I have made my home while preparing to bring justice. Then I will break you.\" \"Peace has cost you your strength. Victory has defeated you.\" \"You don\\'t fear death, you welcome it. Your punishment must be more severe.\" \"Ah, yes, I was wondering what would break first. Your spirit, or your body!\" \"Home, where I learned the truth about despair, as will you. There’s a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth… Hope. Every man who has ventured here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy… So simple… And like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned here that there can be no true despair without hope. So, as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe they can survive so that you can watch them clamoring over each other to “stay in the sun.” You can watch me torture an entire city and when you have truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra’s al Ghul’s destiny… We will destroy Gotham and then, when it is done and Gotham is ashes, then you have my permission to die.\" Behind the scenes David Goyer Bane to writer/director Christopher Nolan for The Dark Knight Rises . Goyer , \"I first brought up Bane, I think Chris was initially horrified. And I said, \\'Hold on, hold on, hold on. This will be the Nolan version of Bane.\\'\" \"He\\'s a creepy, very physical character. Somebody who\\'s been physically distorted. I think Chris liked that.\" Nolan was in search of a physical antagonist for the story. Parts of Bane\\'s character was said by Nolan to have been based on Star Wars villain Darth Vader, \"It’s a little bit of Darth Vader, a little bit of this, little bit of that…\". Nolan also said, \"We wanted more of the Darth Vader, if you like, and that was very important in the story dynamics.\" Nolan compared Bane to Bruce Wayne on the wrong path, \"...His past very much mirrors Bruce Wayne’s in interesting ways, from his training and with the League of Shadows background. Bane represents the wrong path of Bruce Wayne almost back to \\'Batman Begins.\\' So Bane is the return of that danger. The wrong side for Bruce Wayne.\" Bane is known for the usage of the chemical drug venom for physical enhancement in the comics and other adaptations. In The Dark Knight Rises , a type of anesthetic relieves him of any pain and is directly administered into Bane\\'s airways through his mask. Tom Hardy has described Bane as \"brutal\". \"He\\'s a big dude who\\'s incredibly clinical, in the fact that he has a result-based and oriented fighting style. It\\'s not about fighting. It\\'s about carnage. The style is heavy-handed, heavy-footed, it\\'s nasty. Anything from small-joint manipulation to crushing skulls, crushing rib cages, stamping on shins and knees and necks and collarbones and snapping heads off and tearing his fists through chests, ripping out spinal columns. He is a terrorist in mentality as well as brutal action.\" There were some about Bane\\'s being difficult to understand after the The Dark Knight Rises prologue debuted in December 2011. The prologue voice was mostly changed in the later theatrical cut of the full film. A controversy regarding the character ensued nearing the release of the film where several political pundits, including conservative pundit Rush Limbaugh, believed that Bane was intended to reference Bain Capital, the name of the company 2012 Republican Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney formerly ran. Christopher Nolan the comments \"bizarre\", and Bane\\'s conservative co-creator Charles Dixon that Bane\\'s character in the film was closer to Occupy Wall Street. Tom Hardy based Bane\\'s voice on that of an Irish traveler; though many have compared his voice to that of famed actor Sean Connery. Trivia Bane\\'s costume for the film is markedly different from his comic book counterpart who wears a Mexican wrestler\\'s mask. In the film, his mask does not cover his full face, but rather his mouth, jaw, and his back head, with his eyes and brows clearly exposed. He also wears a military grade armored vest, with a matching pair of black combat pants complete with knee pads. He also periodically dons a brown trenchcoat. Tom Hardy stands around 5\\'9\"/5\\'10\" (depending on the source) while Christian Bale is 6\\'0\". Since Bane towers over Batman in height in the comics, special film techniques were used to make Hardy\\'s stature and figure appear larger and imposing. In particular, three-inch lifts were added to Hardy\\'s boots to make him equal in height to other tall characters. Bane holds many similarities with the French Revolutionary, Maximilien de Robespierre . This was in part due to the plot of The Dark Knight Rises being inspired by Charles Dickens\\' A Tale of Two Cities , which took place during the aftermath of the French Revolution , during Robespierre\\'s reign of terror.', 'Talia General Information Real name: Talia Aliases: Miranda Tate Alignment: Bad Affiliation: League of Shadows Ra\\'s al Ghul Warlord\\'s Daughter Bane Bruce Wayne Wayne Enterprises Portrayed by: Marion Cotillard Joey King (older child) Harry Coles (younger child) Appearances: The Dark Knight Rises Talia was the daughter of Ra\\'s al Ghul and the leader of the League of Shadows .

Her mother, the Warlord\\'s daughter , was imprisoned there by the Warlord to take the place of Talia\\'s exiled mercenary father. One day, when Talia was a young child, the prison doctor forgot to lock their cell and her mother was attacked and killed by a group of prisoners. Talia retaliated and stabbed one prisoner in the back with a knife, but then she was protected from reprisals by another prisoner known simply as Bane . As an older child, she was protected by her friend Bane and climbed out of the Pit, the adrenaline caused by her fear gave her the strength to make the jump required to escape. She then found her father, who had joined the League of Shadows and became known as Ra\\'s al Ghul, and brought him to the Pit with the League of Shadows to enact vengeance for the death of his wife. There, he found Bane after the prisoners and doctor had irreparably damaged him after he helped Talia escape. Both Talia and her protector were then trained in the ways of the League. Ra\\'s began to see Bane as a reminder of the hell he left Talia\\'s mother to die in. Bane was then excommunicated from the League of Shadows, due to as Talia put it, because he loved her. It was something she could not forgive her father for until she learned that Batman was responsible for his death in their confrontation during his assault on the Gotham Narrows. She knew the identity of the perpetrator: Bruce Wayne. She committed to ensuring that the League of Shadows fulfilled its mission to restore balance to the world by destroying Gotham City. Talia took on the identity of Miranda Tate and blended into Gotham society, and many years later the un-excommunicated Bane and the rest of the League arrived in Gotham covertly through the use of John Daggett . The Dark Knight Rises The Philanthropist As Miranda Tate, she became a Wayne Enterprises board member engaged in philanthropic endeavors for Gotham City, including charity fundraising. She personally heavily invested in Wayne Enterprises clean energy fusion reactor project. She persistently tried to meet with Bruce to discuss the clean energy project after he shut down the project for three years, but she was ignored by a reclusive Bruce. She was described to Bruce as \"quite lovely\" by Alfred and Lucius Fox . Lucius also described her as \"smart\" to Bruce and reminded him that, \"She has supported the project all the way.\" When Bruce lost all of his money due to identity theft and bad stock trades, he feared a takeover of Wayne Enterprises and the reactor by Daggett and so he showed Miranda the reactor in its bunker under the Gotham River. He told her to take control of the company and the reactor, to keep the reactor safe or destroy it if need be. At their next board meeting, she became the new CEO of Wayne Enterprises. Daggett was then killed by Bane after the meeting. Intimate Encounter Later that day, Miranda met Bruce on the doorstep to Wayne Manor in the pouring rain. He led her to another door which he forced open. She told him, \"I\\'ll take care of your parents\\' legacy, Bruce,\" and began asking about Rachel Dawes and the absence of Alfred at the manor. Miranda kissed Bruce and the power went out. The pair made love, slept together and started a fire, while Miranda admitted she was not always wealthy. She made an excuse for the scar on her back as Bruce traced it with his fingers. Miranda suggested that they leave Gotham together on her plane, to which he replied, \"Someday perhaps. Not tonight,\" as he\\'d planned to meet with Selina Kyle to take him to Bane. He was defeated by Bane and sent to the Pit, and there he learned about the child of Ra\\'s al Ghul and mistakenly assumed it to be Bane. The legend of the child\\'s escape from the Pit inspired Bruce to believe that escape was possible. Guiding Events Soon, a meeting was called by Miranda with a skeptical Lucius to discuss the fusion reactor at Wayne Enterprises, but there Bane and the mercenaries were waiting for them in the board room. They took the two of them and Douglas Fredericks to the underground bunker where the Wanye Enterprises fusion reactor was held. When Fredericks\\' life was threatened, Miranda told them to stop and the reactor was turned on with her and Lucius\\'s hand prints. Dr. Leonid Pavel , a nuclear physicist kidnapped by Bane, turned the reactor into a nuclear bomb and Bane had the core removed. Miranda and Lucius were then released. The bomb was taken to the Gotham City Stadium and there the world was told by Bane that an anonymous citizen, an \"unsung hero,\" controlled the trigger to its detonation. The bomb was later taken to a truck to patrol the streets of Gotham. After Bane took over Gotham, Miranda and the other Wayne Enterprise board members hid with the help of a rag tag group of cops that hoped to free the city. Special forces men led by Captain Jones from the U.S. government infiltrated the city and were brought by John Blake to a meeting with Lucius and Miranda to discuss the bomb. However, Bane and the mercenaries arrived there and killed the special forces men. \"Someone sold us out!\" Blake said as he escaped with Miranda, while the mercenaries took Lucius hostage as the rest of the board members were sent to exile by Jonathan Crane in a kangaroo court. Miranda assisted Jim Gordon in tracking the bomb truck until both were taken captive by a mercenary band led by Barsad . Gordon later discovered that he had been misled into tracking a decoy. The Reveal After five months, Bruce finally escaped the Pit and returned to free Gotham. He met up with Lucius and Miranda as captives, and told Miranda he would not forget about her. Selina helped to rescue Lucius and Batman rescued Gordon, from whom he was told that Bane had Miranda. Batman presented Selina with the Batpod , and she muttered, \"You\\'re gonna wage a war to save your stuck-up girlfriend.\" Rallying an army of officers, Batman and the cops attacked Bane and his men as Miranda watched from the lobby of Gotham City Hall . Batman damaged Bane\\'s mask in their confrontation at city hall and caused him immense pain and Batman gained the advantage over him in the fight. As Batman interrogated him on where the trigger to the nuclear bomb resided, Miranda stabbed Batman and revealed her true identity as Talia, the child of Ra\\'s al Ghul, and the anonymous citizen who had the trigger to the bomb. She told him she was finishing her father\\'s work by destroying the city and told the tale of her past as she repaired Bane\\'s mask. She then hit the trigger, only to discover that her signal was blocked by Gordon. \"Maybe your knife...was too slow,\" Batman commented on her plan. She ordered for a convoy to protect the bomb as it counted down to detonation and told Bane to guard Batman before she said her final goodbye to Bane. She left the lobby of city hall to be escorted from a Tumbler to the bomb truck. Barsad was killed during the escort by Peter Foley and Foley was then killed by Talia\\'s Tumbler. The Convoy Battle Bane was killed by canon fire from the Batpod as Selina arrived to help Batman and she on the Batpod and Batman in the Bat gave chase and dismantled the convoy of Tumblers as they attempted to lead the truck back to the reactor room where Lucius was waiting. Batman fired upon Talia\\'s truck and she swerved off the roadway where the truck fell and she was fatally wounded. In the throes of death, she revealed to Batman that she had anticipated that he was attempting to lure her back to the reactor bunker, and she remotely activated the emergency flood to ensure that they failed in stabilizing the bomb in the reactor. Lucius narrowly escaped the flood in the bunker. She died believing that her plan to destroy the city that killed her father would come true. However, the plan failed as Batman flew the Bat and the bomb over the Gotham bay and let it go where it exploded harmlessly, thus, saving the citizens of Gotham and leaving Talia\\'s death in vain. Abilities Talia became the only known person until Bruce Wayne to climb out and escape the Pit prison, and she did it as a child. Trained by the League of Shadows as a youth, she became a master in the art of deception as well as in persistence and patience. Her lovely demeanor, beauty, smarts, charity, and eco-friendly facade were tools in her deception. She uses her wealth and father\\'s inheritance to restore the world to balance through destruction. Her patience could be a weakness, as she waited too much time to detonate the nuclear bomb or to have Bruce Wayne/Batman killed off, choosing to indulge her desire to have him witness Gotham\\'s demise. In other media Batman Begins novelization Talia is mentioned in the Journals of Ra\\'s al Ghul in the film\\'s novelization (written by character creator Dennis O\\'Neil), where Ra\\'s considers summoning her from Switzerland if Bruce Wayne passed his tests. Ra\\'s writes in his journal, \"It would be good to see my daughter once more.\" Batman Begins disc special features Talia is mentioned in Ra\\'s al Ghul\\'s character biography in the Blu-ray and DVD special features of the film: \"It is little known that Ra\\'s Al Ghul has a child – daughter Talia.\" Behind the scenes Actress Marion Cotillard was director Christopher Nolan\\'s \"immediate\" choice for the role of ; she she was approached while he was writing the screenplay in 2010. However, she did not commit to the film right away because she was pregnant at the time and actresses Naomi Watts, Rachel Weisz, and Kate Winslet were met with and for the role. Marion Cotillard gave birth to her first child in May 2011 about a month before she began filming. Due to this, she is slightly heavier in certain elements of the film but is noticeably thinner towards the climax. Known for roles that exploited both her beauty and figure, Nolan elected to take a different route as he also did with previous female leads, Katie Holmes and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Nolan wanted audiences to be more attracted to the performance rather then the sex appeal of the actress. By doing this, he dressed her up in less revealing clothing and wanted her make up to be true to life rather than the typical Hollywood look. Young actress Leilah de Meza was for the role of young Talia but the role was declined. Trivia Actress India Wadsworth Talia\\'s mother and Ra\\'s al Ghul\\'s wife and is of mixed Chinese heritage, such as Talia\\'s mother has in the comics. She is the first live action portrayal of Talia. There are four incarnations of the character depicted in the film: one as a baby in prison, one as a young child in prison, one as an older child in prison, and one as an adult in Gotham City, The same dramatic music cue plays before the bomb truck with Talia falls as when the train with the microwave emitter runs off of track with Ra\\'s al Ghul in Batman Begins and just as Batman tosses the Joker and he falls in The Dark Knight .', 'Venom General Information First Appearance: Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight #16 Type: Enhancement compound Used by: Bane Batman Lex Luthor Venom was a highly-addictive compound that was engineered to significantly multiply one\\'s physical strength. A common user of Venom was Bane , one of Batman \\'s arch-enemies. Contents 1 History 2 In Other Media 2.1 Animation 2.2 Live Action 2.3 Video Games 4 Trivia History Venom was a potently addictive strength-enhancing super-steroid. According to JSA Classified #17 (November 2006), Venom was based on the Miraclo Formula that was developed at Bannerman Pharmaceuticals, the drug company that was formerly owned by Rex Tyler, the original Hourman. The first appearance of the drug was a five-part story arc, Batman: Venom , in the Batman Anthology Series, Legends of the Dark Knight, issues 16-20. Batman became addicted to the drug while he searched for a way to surpass his limitations. Later, it resurfaced as the power source for Bane, who used it to overpower and cripple Batman in the Knightfall Story Arc. A variant of the original Venom was used by President Lex Luthor in the first \"Superman/Batman\" Story Arc. In Other Media Animation In Batman Beyond , steroid patches known as \"Slappers\" contained small doses of impact-release Venom. They were mainly used as performance enhancers in competitive sports, although the use of multiple patches could produce Bane -like combat abilities. However, they were highly addictive, where long time users of the Slappers started to need one just to get through a normal day. Live Action In the 1997 feature film, Batman & Robin , Venom was based on snake venom samples that were used by Dr. Pamela Isley , which were injected into plants to give them the power to defend themselves, like animals. Her co-worker, Dr. Jason Woodrue , stole the samples from her lab and engineered the Venom compound to create a super-soldier army of which Bane was the prototype. Those Venom samples were also part of Isley\\'s transformation into Poison Ivy. Venom appears in the Gotham episode, \"I Am Bane\" , turning Eduardo Dorrance into Bane and was mentioned in the episode \"Viper\" where it was revealed to be an improved version of the titular drug. It was created by a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises in a move that was implied to be off the books. In addition, it was ostensibly intended to be used for warfare. Video Games Batman: Arkham Asylum introduced a highly-altered version of Venom that was called Titan . That formula was developed by Dr. Penelope Young to strengthen the inmates of Arkham Island so that they could survive the most stressful treatment methods that were needed against the hardcore insanity of many of Arkham\\'s worst. After the Joker learned of the chemical\\'s potential, he funded Dr. Young\\'s research under the alias Jack White, and allowed her to have Bane covertly transferred to Arkham from Blackgate Prison and drained the Venom from his blood, which caused Bane to suffer from debilitating side effects and near-constant pain. Titan was much more potent than Venom, and required only a small amount for a Bane-like reaction. The treatment had a price, as the sudden release of endorphins and adrenaline, along with the extreme pain of the transformation, resulted in the recipient going into a crazed, psychotic state. The subject underwent not only a size change, but grotesque facial and muscular disfigurement, and even caused their spinal columns to become exposed. Only the Joker retained his normal personality after his injection, as he was already insane, and actually enjoyed the painful transformation, which in his case, caused his exposed spinal column to resemble a set of dorsal fins. Batman , after he took a Titan-filled dart that was meant for the captive Commissioner Gordon , chose to resist the change and used the antidote on himself, much to Joker\\'s chagrin. It was possible the drug reduced even Joker\\'s intelligence, for while the fight was a ferocious one, Batman had no trouble in finding a strategy to bring Joker down. Whatever his overall health, Joker did not look well when he was shown in withdrawal during the game\\'s closing scenes, nor did his formerly enhanced henchmen. In Batman: Arkham Origins , Bane was shown as being one of the eight assassins who was hired to kill Batman on Christmas Eve. Besides his regular use of Venom, which he acknowledged as a weakness, Bane also developed a variant of Venom, TN-1, as a means to overcome his addiction, but was reluctant to use it until it was perfected because it caused permanent and gradual memory loss. Bane learned about Batman\\'s true identity, but the drug seemed to have the effect of memory loss on the user. The drug greatly increased the user\\'s bone density and muscle strength.', 'League of Shadows General Information Leader(s): Ra\\'s al Ghul Talia Former Members: Bane (later rejoined) Bruce Wayne Status: Defunct Base of Operations: League of Shadows Monastery , Tibet (formerly) Gotham City (formerly) The League of Shadows was an organization led by Ra\\'s al Ghul in the film Batman Begins , and later by his daughter Talia in The Dark Knight Rises . Contents 1 History 1.1 Origin 1.2 Batman Begins 1.3 The Dark Knight Rises 2 Known Members 4 Behind the scenes 5 See also History Origin The League of Shadows was an ancient and powerful secret society whose stated purpose was to restore balance to the world by enacting purges at various points in history. They targeted places they deemed were the greatest sources of civilization\\'s corruption and decadence, places that led to suffering and injustice. Acting as a self-appointed check against human corruption for thousands of years, some of the previous activities of the League included the sacking of Rome, starting the Black Plague, the great London fire, and the Gotham economic depression . The men who have sworn allegiance to the League of Shadows come from many different backgrounds; former soldiers, mercenaries, assassins, petty criminals, and ordinary men. However, all of them share a common similarity of hating what they define as evil and a desire to serve what they call true justice. Every member of the League of Shadows is fanatically loyal to the League\\'s cause. It is this fanaticism in which every warrior knows that he is expendable, his life forfeit, if it means fulfillment of the League\\'s plans. They are trained in the arts of theatricality and deception. Thirty years before the events of The Dark Knight Rises , a foreign mercenary in an ancient part of the world was exiled by the warlord that he worked for because he married the warlord\\'s daughter. The mercenary\\'s pregnant wife was imprisoned in a Pit as price for his exile. The mercenary became Ra\\'s al Ghul, the leader of the League of Shadows, and one day his young child, Talia, found her way back to him after escaping from the prison. The League stormed the ancient prison to exact revenge over the death of his wife in the prison. In the process they rescued an inmate, Bane , the protector of his young daughter in the prison. Talia and Bane were then trained by the League, but Bane was excommunicated by Ra\\'s al Ghul for reminding Ra\\'s of the hell he left his wife to die in and for loving Talia. Talia resented her father\\'s decision. The League was then based on a mountain in the Himalayas (though other bases around the world may have existed). Batman Begins Bruce Wayne joined the League of Shadows to seek the means to fight injustice. He was still traumatized by the murder of his parents during the Gotham depression but had learned to give up on the idea of revenge. While traveling the globe, he was recruited from a Bhutanese prison by a man calling himself \"Ducard\", who saw great potential in the angry young man. During the final test in his training, Bruce was asked to act as an executioner and learned what the League really was about, that their leader wanted him to lead a mission to destroy the city of Bruce\\'s birth. Bruce then destroyed their base and left the man he believed to be Ra\\'s al Ghul to die there. However, he saved Ducard, his teacher while in the League. Over seven years after his disappearance from the city, Bruce returned to Gotham and planned to root out its criminality and the corrupt. He became Batman to enact this plan, and used Ducard\\'s lessons in the martial arts, stealth, intimidation, and theatricality. Meanwhile, the League was busy bringing a fear toxin (created from a hallucinogenic blue flower grown near their Himalayan base) into Gotham by employing some of Gotham\\'s criminals, most notably Carmine Falcone and The Scarecrow . After Batman put both men behind bars, the League was forced to act sooner than expected and Ducard revealed to Bruce that he was Ra\\'s al Ghul. Using a microwave emitter stolen from Wayne Enterprises , they began vaporizing the city\\'s water supply, which the toxin had contaminated. Everyone who breathed in the toxin turned on each other in blind panic. Batman, with the help of Jim Gordon , was able to stop the League before it could vaporize all the water in the city. In the process, Batman left Ra\\'s for dead on a train that crashed, causing him to perish in the crash and resulting explosion. The Dark Knight Rises Following the death of Ra\\'s al Ghul for which she blamed Bruce Wayne, Talia forgave her father and attempted to bring justice over his death and finish her father\\'s work with the aid of Bane, who had become known as a mercenary with a rumored reputation following his excommunication from the League. Talia posed as Miranda Tate and came to Gotham, and became a shareholder and board member of Wayne Enterprises to fund the creation of a nuclear fusion reactor for which Bane abducted Doctor Pavel to turn into a nuclear bomb years later. Batman asked Selina Kyle to take him to Bane after Bruce lost his fortune due to the risky trades made during the League\\'s attack on the Gotham Stock Exchange so that Talia could takeover Wayne Enterprises and the reactor. In Bane\\'s sewer lair underneath Gotham, Batman was challenged to a fight by Bane, wherein he outlined his aim of fulfilling Ra\\'s al Ghul\\'s destiny by destroying Gotham. Bruce was sent to the Pit after his defeat so that he could see it unfold and suffer. The League of Shadows employed Gotham\\'s older orphans to work in the sewers, as well as John Daggett \\'s construction crews to pour explosive cement throughout the city that was later detonated. The city was held hostage as Bane posed as its liberator in a false revolution. The ranks of the League of Shadows were augmented as former Blackgate prisoners and others joined their army. Talia continued to use her false persona to undermine Batman\\'s allies in various ways such as alerting Bane of a meeting with U.S. Special Forces within the city and misleading Gordon\\'s group of cops into believing that a decoy truck was the one containing the nuclear bomb. After Batman\\'s return, Talia revealed herself to him and unsuccessfully used her trigger to detonate the bomb and left city hall to ensure its detonation. Bane was shot dead by Selina on the Batpod , and Batman fired on Talia\\'s bomb truck in his aerial vehicle the Bat and led it to crash where she drew her last breaths, confident her plan for the nuclear annihilation of Gotham was unstoppable. The other members of the League of Shadows in the city were killed or captured by the GCPD. Batman saved the city by sending the bomb far away from Gotham over the water where it detonated.

      "    response='Cooperative Answer: In the Batman comics and adaptations, Bane\\'s knowledge of Batman\\'s secret identity as Bruce Wayne varies depending on the story. For instance, in some comic arcs like \"Batman: Arkham Origins,\" Bane does discover Bruce\\'s identity, but his use of the drug Venom often leads to memory issues, making it inconsistent. In the film \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" it\\'s not explicitly shown that Bane knows, though his ally Talia al Ghul does, and they collaborate closely—so it\\'s possible he inferred it through their partnership. This adds layers to Bane\\'s character as a strategic foe. If you\\'re piecing together the Batman universe, it\\'s fascinating how these secrets drive the plot—would you like to dive into more on Talia\\'s role or other villains who might have figured it out?'\n",

      "    reasoning=\"Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to analyze the inputs, infer how the user's goals and needs influence the response, and ensure the answer is accurate, pragmatic, and anticipatory. First, I review the conversation history, which shows the user has been asking about Game of Thrones seasons and episodes, starting from questions about release dates and progressing to episode details. This indicates a pattern of building knowledge sequentially, so my response must maintain continuity by linking back to this context without introducing spoilers for undiscussed parts. Second, the current question is 'tell me the plot of the episode,' which is vague and doesn't specify which one; based on the history, it likely refers to Season 6 or a prominent episode like 'Blackwater' from the context, as that's the most recent detailed reference. Third, the context provides extensive summaries of various episodes, such as 'Blackwater,' 'What Is Dead May Never Die,' and Season 6 overviews, which I can draw from to provide a focused, accurate summary.

Her sole sibling is her younger brother, Jojen Reed . Having grown up in the North, she is a firm believer in the Old Gods of the Forest . Season 3 As Bran , Rickon , Osha , Hodor , Summer , and Shaggydog are fleeing towards Castle Black following the Sack of Winterfell , Meera surprises Osha by placing a knife to her throat so that Osha will drop her wooden spear aimed on the back of Jojen\\'s neck. Jojen tells that they have been searching for a long time so that they can offer their protection. Osha remarks that Jojen must be ashamed to have to rely on his sister for protection, but Meera dismisses her, claiming that some people will always need protection, but that doesn\\'t mean they are any less of a person. Osha and Meera continue to not get along, fighting over simple things like how best to skin a rabbit until Bran tells them to get along. Meera also cares for her brother while he is having seizure-like symptoms when he is having visions . Continuing northward, Osha remains distrustful of the Reed siblings, peppering Jojen as to whether his conversations of magic are helpful. She reacts with horror when Jojen mentions that they intend to go beyond the Wall to find the Three-Eyed Raven. Osha bluntly refuses to go, explaining that she lost her husband, who then rose from the dead and tried to kill her. She rages that none of them understand what lies beyond the Wall and that there is nothing left for men there. While in the Gift , the group seeks shelter from a rainstorm in an abandoned windmill when Meera spots a horse. She and the others witness the man being surrounded by wildlings and fear that a scared Hodor yelling will alert the wildlings to their hiding place, but Bran uses his powers to enter Hodor\\'s mind and make him sleep. Bran decides that he and Rickon should separate and that Osha and Shaggydog go with him. Before she leaves, Osha makes Meera and Jojen promise to keep Bran safe. Meera arrives with the remaining members of the group at Nightfort , a long unused Night\\'s Watch castle along the Wall . Bran recalls a lot of scary stories he had heard from Old Nan about Nightfort, but Meera expresses her love of scary stories so Bran retells the legend of the Rat Cook . Later, a dark figure appears from a well, frightening the group. Meera pins the figure down, knife in hand, yet it is only Sam with Gilly and her baby . After discovering who each other are, Sam warns Bran and the others of the White Walkers , but Bran insists that although he would like to join Sam at Castle Black, he and the others must continue on their quest. Sam supplies them dragonglass , and noticing that Meera uses a bow, gives her extra for her arrows. Season 4 Meera interrupts Bran\\'s warging, stating that he was gone for hours. Jojen warns Bran of the dangers of staying within the minds of others for too long. Meera supports her brother, insisting to Bran that he would forget his friends, his family, his home, and even himself. Around their campfire at night, Meera and her companions hears the cries of a baby ( Craster\\'s last son left outside by Rast ). Bran wargs into Summer to investigate, but notices Ghost in a cage and Summer falls into a trap. They discover the mutineers at Craster\\'s Keep, but Meera, noticing the cruel treatment of the girls, insists they leave the area. Bran wants to free the trapped direwolves, but they are ambushed by the mutineers and taken to Karl Tanner . Karl threatens Meera and Jojen, who begins to hypersalivate with the toil of Greensight, which forces Bran to reveal his identity to them. Later, Karl and other mutineers prepare to rape Meera in front of her companions, but they are interrupted by the arrival of Jon Snow and the Night\\'s Watch. During the ensuing battle, Locke finds the four of them and takes Bran away, intending to kill him. Bran wargs into Hodor and kills Locke by snapping his neck. As the raid on Craster\\'s Keep continues, Bran, Jojen, Meera, and Hodor escape. As they are walking to the great weirwood tree (the roots of which descend into the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven ), Meera laments Jojen\\'s ill health. However, Jojen points out their arrival at their destination. As they proceed, Jojen is grabbed from beneath the snow and dragged by a wight , but Meera comes to his aid before he is dragged beneath the snow. Meera successfully protects him from the Wights and pushes Jojen to the ground before it can kill him. As Jojen lies in the snow, Meera takes her eyes off him and continues to fight other wights. While Meera is distracted, a wight lying next to Jojen, that she believed to be dead, pulls out a knife and stabs him repeatedly. Leaf tells her that he is lost, and telling her to leave him for dead, which Jojen reciprocates, but before leaving, slits his throat out of mercy. She gets inside the cave and follows Leaf with Bran and Hodor where they meet the Three-Eyed Raven . She inquires into her brother\\'s death, to which the Raven then reveals that Jojen knew that the quest would cost his life. Season 6 Meera remains in the Weirwood cave with Bran, Summer, Hodor, Leaf, and the Three-Eyed Raven. After Bran has a vision of his father as a child, he finds Meera sitting just outside the cave entrance. She confides in him that she is having trouble coping with their apparent inaction towards the coming war, and Bran reminds her that it\\'s not safe anywhere outside. After he leaves, Leaf tells her that she needs to protect Bran at all costs. While Meera is sleeping one night, Bran comes into contact with the Night King . When he wakes up and cries out, Meera awakens as well. The Three-Eyed Raven informs them of their situation. She briefly speaks to Hodor before realizing how close the White Walkers are. Meera rushes to the entrance of the cave and sees the vast army of the dead approaching. On Leaf\\'s orders, she dashes back into the cave, picks up a spear, and frantically tries to wake Bran up from his latest vision. Meera\\'s latest words enter Bran\\'s thoughts, and as the wights enter the cave, she encourages him to warg into Hodor. She kills several wights and successfully shatters one White Walker with a spear of dragonglass . She carries Bran out of the cave in a cart, begging both present and past Hodor to \"hold the door\". Although all the other inhabitants of the cave perish, Meera escapes the battle alive with Bran, whilst Hodor is killed by the wights. However, Meera struggles to pull both Bran and the cart as they continue to run from the army of the dead. Bran remains despondent, and continues to have visions of both past, present, and future. They are eventually found by the wight horde just as Bran wakes up, and Meera apologizes for not being able to protect him due to their sheer numbers and her exhaustion. Just before the Wights close in, however, a mysterious figure clad in a hooded black cloak arrives, killing several wights with a flaming chain. He pulls Bran and Meera up onto his horse, and they ride away. The mysterious figure, once they have found a safe place to make a fire, reveals himself as Benjen Stark , Bran\\'s uncle, who has previously been thought to be dead. He claims that he was attacked by White Walkers while on a ranging party, and left for dead after being stabbed through the gut, and that the magic of the Children of the Forest saved his life. He also tells Bran that he has now embodied the Three-Eyed Raven , and must face the Night King when the time comes. Meera, Bran, and Benjen eventually arrive at the weirwood tree, not far from the Wall . Claiming that the magic of the Children of the Forest prevents him from passing beyond the Wall, Benjen says his farewells and once again disappears into the forest, promising to continue to fight for the living. Meera watches while Bran connects to the tree, wary of the events following the last time he warged, who sees a vision of his aunt Lyanna \\'s death, and the birth of Jon at the Tower of Joy . Season 7 After arriving at the wall, Meera and Bran are met by the acting Lord Commander of Night\\'s Watch Eddison Tollett . Meera introduces herself as the daughter of Howland Reed and Bran as well, though Tollett demands some sort of proof that the two of them are indeed who they say they are. Bran delivers an ominous warning regarding the arrival of winter and the white walkers, and Eddison allows them to pass through the wall. Together with Bran, Meera arrives at Winterfell where she witnesses Bran reuniting with his sister, Sansa . Later, Meera comes to Bran\\'s chambers, explaining that she needs to go back to Greywater Watch to be with her family when the White Walkers come. When all Bran has to say is \"thank you\", Meera angrily says that Bran is only alive due to the sacrifices made by her brother, Summer and Hodor. However, Bran says that he is no longer \"Bran Stark\", and is now only the Three-Eyed Raven. Meera, with tears in her eyes, agrees, saying that the real Bran died in the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven. She then leaves Winterfell and returns to her home. Following her brother\\'s death, Meera is now the sole Heir to Greywater Watch and House Reed.

Summary In King\\'s Landing Tyrion Lannister leads the defense of King\\'s Landing against an assault by King Stannis Baratheon in the Battle of the Blackwater . He spends the night before the expected siege in bed with Shae , telling her she can still leave the city, but she stays loyal to him. Tyrion has Varys provide him with a map of the tunnel network beneath the city. Varys tells Tyrion that he is all that stands between them and defeat. Bronn drinks with the Lannister men and has a confrontation with the Hound . Stannis plans a naval assault aiming to overcome the city\\'s small defensive fleet and land his troops at the walls of the city near the Mud Gate , unaware of Tyrion\\'s plan. From the battlements, Joffrey berates Tyrion, demanding to know why his ships are not meeting Stannis\\'s fleet. Tyrion has anticipated his strategy and does not field his fleet. Instead he sends a single ship filled with Wildfire into the heart of Stannis\\'s fleet, leaking the volatile substance over the surface of the water. Bronn has been awaiting Tyrion\\'s signal outside the city on the shores of the bay, and when Tyrion tosses a torch from the battlements, Bronn fires a flaming arrow triggering a massive, massive aquatic explosion. The ensuing conflagration devastates Stannis\\'s fleet and destroys the ship of his high captain, Davos Seaworth , as well as killing Davos\\'s son, Matthos . Stannis responds by putting his men ashore inside row boats, landing further from the walls to avoid the still burning inner bay. With less protection for his troops he predicts that thousands will die. He leads the assault personally and is the first to reach the walls. Tyrion orders Sandor Clegane to lead a sortie beyond the Mud Gate to repel the attackers. Sandor does as asked but is terrified by the fire and breaks down emotionally. Ser Lancel Lannister accompanies him and is wounded by an arrow. Bronn joins the fight in time to save the Hound\\'s life. The Hound retreats after losing half of his men and refuses to go out again. He demands wine and walks away from the battle and his place in the Kingsguard, after saying in the presence of all, including the king, \"Fuck the kings guard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king.\" Queen Regent Cersei Lannister offers protection to the ladies of the court in Maegor\\'s Holdfast . She was gifted previously Essence of Nightshade (which was explained as \"calming\" with one drop in wine; will send one into a deep sleep with three drops, and with ten drops is lethal) by Grand Maester Pycelle and keeps the headsman Ser Ilyn Payne at her side at all times, preparing for the worst. She drinks wine heavily during the assault and seems to simultaneously torment and mother her captive, Sansa Stark , with matter-of-fact descriptions of the rapes that will occur if the city falls. She also begins to question Shae, who seems to her perhaps an unlikely handmaiden. When Lancel comes to tell her that Stannis has reached the walls Cersei orders him to bring Joffrey back to the Red Keep , ignoring his protests that it would damage morale. Joffrey willingly leaves the defensive line with Lancel and charges Ser Mandon Moore and Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard to fight in the King\\'s name. The gold cloaks\\' morale is broken by his departure. Tyrion steels himself to lead a sortie of his own. He rallies his men by telling them to fight for their city, their homes and their women, if not for their king and utters his famous line, \"Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let\\'s go kill them!\" He leads his men through the tunnels beneath the city and is able to defeat Stannis\\'s troops manning a battering ram at the Mud Gate. Tyrion is betrayed by Ser Mandon while fighting against a group of reinforcements. Mandon attacks Tyrion with the intent of killing him but misjudged the distance and only slashes Tyrion across the face with his sword. Before he can strike Tyrion again, Tyrion\\'s squire Podrick Payne kills Ser Mandon from behind with his spear. Tyrion, barely conscious and held by Podrick watches a battle that seems lost before losing consciousness. Lancel returns to Cersei to warn that they are defeated unless Joffrey returns. When Lancel tries to be firm with her, Cersei ignores his counsel, pushes him out of the way (deliberately causing him pain by hitting his injured side), and storms out. Sansa tries to keep up the morale of the other women, frightened by Cersei\\'s sudden departure. She leads the sheltered noblewomen in singing a hymn. Shae tells Sansa to go to her chambers, lock herself in, and await Stannis, as he would not harm her but Ser Ilyn might. Sansa finds the Hound waiting in her room. He offers to take her north to Winterfell , but she says she will be safe there when Stannis takes the throne. The Hound scares Sansa, but tells her to look at him, saying that since the world is made up of killers like Stannis, her father, her brother Robb , and he himself, she better get used to looking at them. Though he promises to protect her, she is still too afraid of him to go with him. Cersei has taken Tommen to the throne room. She sits with him on the Iron Throne , and tells him a story about a young lion and how he did not need to fear other beasts of the forest, the wolf and the stag. As she does this, she readies the poison (the Essence of Nightshade, mentioned and gifted earlier) for herself and for her son. The forces of Tywin Lannister and his new allies in House Tyrell join the battle. Their cavalry charge is led by a warrior dressed in the armor of Renly Baratheon and he decimates Stannis\\'s army. The survivors flee to their ships. Stannis is dragged from the battle by his guards, screaming for his men to stand and fight. Tyrion collapses into unconsciousness as the battle turns in the Crown\\'s favor. Tywin bursts into the throne room and announces their victory, just in time to stop Cersei from killing Tommen. Ser Loras Tyrell reveals himself as the knight wearing Renly\\'s armor. Recap A detailed recap of the episode, scene by scene.

The battle takes place where the Blackwater Rush pours its waters into Blackwater Bay . This is the second episode of the series written by George R.R. Martin , the writer of the novels, following on from \" The Pointy End \" in the first season . It was also the first episode of the second season to be named, with Martin revealing the name \"Blackwater\" in a blog post on June 1, 2011, a year before broadcasting. George R.R. Martin especially announced on his blog that director Neil Marshall would be helming this episode, noting that he was a fan of Marshall\\'s feature film work, particularly the 2005 horror film The Descent . It was reported that co-producer Vince Gerardis had said that the titular and iconic Battle of the Blackwater will take up 16 minutes of the finished episode. However, this was later corrected to a general statement that it takes up a notable portion of the episode and is impressive, but likely not as impressive as some fans would like it to be. Producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss were disappointed at not being able to film the large-scale Battle of the Green Fork in Season 1, so always planned to shoot the Battle of the Blackwater. At one stage budgetary restrictions made it look like it would not be possible and the battle would have to take place off-screen, but the producers were able to convince HBO to provide a larger budget for the episode. Despite the larger budget and a creative decision to move the battle to the night, there was still not enough time or money to film the battle as depicted in the books. George R.R. Martin was aware of this and pared the battle down significantly in his script. However, it still retained several elements that the producers then had to remove to make the budget work. The original director for the episode pulled out at short notice. Neil Marshall was a last-minute replacement, although the producers were familiar with his feature work. Marshall ended up adding more elements and sequences to the battle than the producers had envisioned after the script rewrites. Marshall has not read the books, but marathoned Season 1 for two weeks prior to the beginning of the month-long filming of the episode. According to Marshall, none of the specific instances of gore during the battle scenes were specifically written into the script (The Hound cutting a man in half, Stannis cutting the top of a man\\'s head off), but were improvisations he was left to develop on his own. This episode had the largest budget and largest number of visual effects of any episode of Game of Thrones \\u200b \\u200buntil the end of the fourth season with the episode The Watchers on the Wall , which is the current most expensive episode. The song playing over the end credits is The Rains of Castamere performed by The National. Jerome Flynn, who plays Bronn, sings The Rains of Castamere in this episode. Flynn had three British #1 singles in the 1990s as one half of the pop duo Robson and Jerome . George R.R. Martin\\'s original script featured both the chain and also large numbers of horses in the battle. The former was removed for budgetary reasons, the latter for pacing. Actually, Martin specifies in the Blu-ray commentary for this episode that the chain was never included even in the earliest drafts he wrote of this episode. Producers Benioff & Weiss told him right from the start that given all of the other expenses of the Battle of the Blackwater scenes (which had already broken their budget), they knew going in that the chain sequence was simply beyond their available price limit. Martin did include in the earliest draft a sequence from the books featuring three great trebuchets in the city known as the Three Whores, which Joffrey uses to launch Stannis-loyalists known as the Antler Men over the walls at the approaching army (they\\'re called the \"Antler Men\" because in mockery Joffrey ordered his soldiers to physically nail deer antlers onto the men\\'s heads, then shoot them over the walls as they\\'re bleeding but still alive). Ultimately, the Three Whores and the Antler Men also had to be cut for budgetary reasons. Martin also said in the Blu-ray commentary that Benioff and Weiss rewrote the dialogue in the final scene with Cersei and Tommen sitting on the Iron Throne, and he likes their revised version much more than what he had originally written. Initially HBO asked the producers if they needed an extra $500,000 to film the battle. Benioff and Weiss ended up asking for $2,500,000, and got slightly more than $2,000,000. The conference call to discuss this was described as \"intense\". The original director left due to his father being ill. Benioff and Weiss drafted in Neil Marshall at short notice: they asked him on a Saturday morning to start prep on the Monday. Marshall agreed, watching the entire first season back-to-back on the Sunday before getting on a plane. Benioff thought of Marshall due to his wife\\'s fear of Marshall\\'s movie, The Descent . Marshall had a week and a half of prep before the start of shooting. Marshall was puzzled by the script, in which Stannis disappears once the fighting at the wall starts. The entire sequence of Stannis climbing the wall, fighting off the defenders and watching his army\\'s defeat before being dragged from the field was added by Marshall. According to Martin\\'s Blu-ray commentary, he didn\\'t write the scene at the tavern before the battle between Bronn and Sandor Clegane. He enjoys this scene, which was written by Benioff and Weiss. The scene where Cersei prepares to poison Tommen was inspired by Magda Goebbels poisoning her own children before committing suicide during the fall of Berlin in World War II. Martin in the Blu-ray commentary for this episode, as well as Benioff and Weiss in their Blu-ray commentary two episodes ago in \" A Man Without Honor \", both state that despite all of Sansa Stark\\'s scenes in Season 2 involving severe beatings, rapes, and threats of violence, easily the scene actress Sophie Turner was most frightened of filming was the brief moment when she has to sing in front of everyone in this episode. All agreed that Turner actually has a good singing voice, and she really only sings three lines from the hymn Gentle Mother, Font of Mercy , but she was still quite terrified. Benioff and Weiss speculate that this is because while an attempted rape scene might seem scary to viewers, the actors rehearse the scene in so many alternate takes that they are no longer surprised by what is happening. In contrast, no matter how many takes are filmed, there is always the danger that you might perform badly while singing. Benioff claimed that the battle at the end of the fourth season, now known as the Battle of Castle Black , would dwarf the Battle of the Blackwater. He envisaged more complex negotiations to secure the budget for it. Cersei notes that Shae is from the Free City of Lorath , as she recognizes her accent from a Lorathi handmaiden she used to have. In the books, Shae isn\\'t actually from the Free Cities at all, she\\'s just a camp follower of the Lannister army and her backstory is never gone into in detail, but she is from Westeros. The TV producers stated that they changed it so that when she is introduced in Season 1, Shae is stated to be \"from the Free Cities\" (they hadn\\'t settled on which one yet) because they enjoyed the audition of actress Sibel Kekilli, but wanted to have some explanation for why she speaks with a German accent. What\\'s curious about this is that five novels into the series, no named characters, save from Jaqen H\\'ghar , whose origins are unknown, come from Lorath and very little is said about it, due to its relative lack of importance. Identifying Shae as Lorathi, however, also serves to explain Jaqen\\'s similar accent. The episode won two Creative Arts Emmy Awards , for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing, in 2012. It went on to win the prestigious 2013 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. Previously, Season 1 as a whole won the 2012 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form, but no individual episode was nominated for Short Form. Conversely, Season 2 was not nominated for Long Form at all, but \"Blackwater\" itself was nominated and won for Short Form, as the climax episode of the season. Game of Thrones has often not had hyped \"season finales\", but had the climax of the season in the second to last episode: in the books, several chapters usually follow the climax as an epilogue to set up the next book. Thus the ninth episode of each of the first three seasons is typically the climax of that season\\'s storyline. Dinklage deviated from the script when Tyrion says \"I\\'ll lead the attack\", ad-libbing that he says it under his breath first, in a moment of surprise and realization. As D.B. Weiss said, \"I think that that choice as such a smart choice. You can see the look of shock on his face that he\\'s actually made this decision...it\\'s at the crux of the question: Is Tyrion surprised by his own actions?\" In a podcast interview with Empire magazine on June 1, 2012, Marshall was asked about the \" Sexposition \" in the TV series - frequently invented scenes of predominately female nudity. He recalled that an (unnamed) executive producer repeatedly urged him to add more full-frontal nudity during filming - for the pre-battle scene with Bronn and the Lannister soldiers at the brothel. Marshall actually felt that the scene didn\\'t require full frontal nudity from the prostitute actress, and was distracting, and requested that they take it out. Marshall ultimately lost this disagreement and the full frontal nudity was put in. According to Marshall, this producer overruled his request by saying, \"everyone else in the series [represents the] drama side. I represent the perv[ert] side of the audience, and I\\'m saying I want full frontal nudity in the scenes\". Marshall described the meeting as \"pretty surreal\". In a subsequent interview, Rory McCann (Sandor Clegane) stated that showrunners Benioff and Weiss would disagree with the instructions that episode director Neil Marshall gave him on how to play several scenes in the episode - to the point that when Marshall wasn\\'t around, they went behind his back and commanded McCann to ignore Marshall\\'s instructions and play scenes the way they wanted him to. McCann followed the showrunners\\' commands, because as he put it, \"You don\\'t bite the hand that feeds you\".', 'What Is Dead May Never Die Season 2 Episode 3 Airdate April 15, 2012 Runtime 53 minutes Written by Bryan Cogman Directed by Alik Sakharov Episode guide Previous Next \" The Night Lands \" \" Garden of Bones \" \" What Is Dead May Never Die \" is the third episode of the second season of Game of Thrones .

Lord Commander Jeor Mormont questions Jon about his actions. Jon realizes that Jeor has known all along that Craster is sacrificing his sons. However, Mormont considers Craster too valuable a contact to risk offending, as he is one of their few sources of information and shelter beyond the Wall . Mormont himself is disgusted by Craster\\'s human sacrifices (not to mention his incestuous relationships with his own daughters), but he will not interfere, and forbids Jon from doing so, as Craster has helped many members of the Night\\'s Watch, among them, Benjen Stark .

Renly tries to initiate sex with his lover Loras but is rebuffed. Loras reminds him of the importance of fathering an heir and goes to fetch his sister Queen Margaery. Margaery fails to seduce Renly. She is pragmatic about his homosexuality, and suggests including her brother in their love making, asserting the importance of producing an heir. On the Iron Islands Theon Greyjoy is included in his father Balon \\'s war council. Balon reveals his plan to attack the lightly defended North while their armies are fighting against House Lannister . Theon is fuming when he is assigned a single ship to raid the fishing villages of the Stony Shore while his sister Yara is put in command of thirty ships and told to take Deepwood Motte . Theon implores his father to reconsider, claiming that if the Greyjoys attack the North, they face the possibility of total destruction if they lose, but if they ally with the Starks and win, Balon will be crowned King of the Iron Islands and House Greyjoy will be awarded Casterly Rock and essentially the source of the Lannisters\\' wealth along with it, but Balon rebuffs Theon and chastises him for becoming loyal to the Starks. Theon challenges his father\\'s lack of faith in him and reminds him that he gave him up as a ward. Balon reacts by hitting his son and storming out as Theon shouts at him from behind. Theon considers warning Robb about his father\\'s actions, but ultimately reaffirms his loyalty to his family by being baptised by a Drowned Man .

John Bradley is credited ahead of Jerome Flynn and Conleth Hill when he was credited after them in \"The Night Lands,\" he was credited before them in \"The North Remembers.\" Alfie Allen is credited before Isaac Hempstead-Wright and Sophie Turner when he was credited after them when they last appeared together in \"The North Remembers.\" Tobias Winter makes his first credited appearance as Timett , having previously played the character uncredited as a featured extra. Rob Cooper , Jamie Edgell , Dave Forman , Paul Herbert , Michelle McKeown , Camilla Naprous , Jimmy O\\'Dee and C.C. Smiff were stunt performers in this episode. Notes This episode marks the first time that House Martell of Dorne is introduced into the narrative, as Tyrion is planning a marriage-alliance with them. They were previously referred to in Season 1\\'s episode \" The Wolf and the Lion ,\" but they were only mentioned in passing during Bran Stark\\'s geography lesson, and out of context viewers who haven\\'t read the books wouldn\\'t have understood how important they are. Tyrion says \"Myrcella will wed their [the Martells] youngest son\" without specifying his name, implying the son in question has siblings. In the books, Doran Martell has two sons - Trystane (the youngest) and Quentyn, and one daughter - Arianne, his elder child and heir. Arianne and Quentyn have been omitted from the show, and Trystane has been established to be Doran\\'s heir and only child. \"What is dead may never die\" is a common saying in the religion of the Drowned God on the Iron Islands . The answer to the phrase is \"But rises again harder and stronger.\" In the episode the phrase is begun by Theon Greyjoy during his baptism and completed by the Drowned Man conducting the ceremony. This episode is the first director credit for Alik Sakharov , who has previously worked on the series as a director of photography. Even though they are not featured in the episode, Dragonstone and Essos appear in the title sequence. Renly\\'s sexual relationship with Loras was implied in the books, but happened largely \"off-screen.\" Author George R.R. Martin has confirmed that they were lovers. When Renly departs from Catelyn to share an intimate moment with Loras in his tent, he tells Catelyn that he is retiring for the evening to \"pray.\" In the books, this is an excuse which Renly and Loras frequently use to explain away their romantic trysts. Right after Renly agrees to make Brienne one of his Kingsguard, when Loras looks upset, Renly actually winks at Loras (it is not easy to see because it is a wide shot). Tyrion finds out which member of the small council is spying for his sister by giving each suspect a unique piece of information, and then seeing which one his sister finds out about. This method, commonly known as a \" Barium meal test ,\" has been used in intelligence agencies for decades. In the novel Patriot Games , author Tom Clancy calls this a Canary Trap. The film Patriot Games features cast member Sean Bean . An actual use of this method is performed in another of Clancy\\'s novels, Without Remorse . In the books, Tyrion\\'s three \"interviews\" to discover which of the Small Council members is secretly working for Cersei happen sequentially, and involve a large amount of \"inner monologue\" from Tyrion\\'s point of view as he contrasts each interview with the previous one. The TV series instead intercuts each of the three interviews, showing each of the men\\'s reactions to Tyrion\\'s questions. In the books, Tyrion never considers Theon Greyjoy as one of the (fake) marriage-alliance proposals for Myrcella. In both versions, Tyrion meets with Pycelle first, but in the books he met with Littlefinger second and Varys last (in the TV version, Varys went second and Littlefinger went last). Instead of proposing to marry Myrcella to Theon, Tyrion tells Varys that he intends send her brother Tommen to Dorne as a ward (and possibly for a later marriage alliance). Moreover, through his spy network, Varys seems to be already aware that Tyrion told Littlefinger that he intended to marry off Myrcella to House Arryn; rather than contradict this, Tyrion tells Varys that in addition he also intends to send Tommen to Dorne. Notice that, in the TV version, Varys seems visibly confused when Tyrion says that he intends to marry off Myrcella to the Greyjoys; the TV producers may be intentionally implying that - as in the books - Varys already knew of Tyrion\\'s previously announced marriage-alliance plans (in this case, telling Pycelle that he intended to marry her off to House Martell), and is confused that Tyrion is informing him of a completely different plan. Two strong men have to struggle with some difficulty to drag Pycelle out of his chambers when Tyrion orders him taken to the black cells - a nod to the fact that in secret, Pycelle isn\\'t nearly as weak and frail as he pretends to be in public, as revealed in Season 1\\'s \" Fire and Blood .\" He makes some attempt to behave humbly during Tyrion\\'s interrogation, but once he sees that he can\\'t appeal to Tyrion\\'s mercy and is being sent to the dungeons, he drops the act. Cersei becoming so angry with Tyrion about \"selling\" Myrcella into a marriage alliance that she shoves him, knocking him down backwards against some steps, was not in the script. It was ad-libbed by actress Lena Headey on the spur of the moment, and both she and Peter Dinklage just acted through it. As originally scripted, for the scene in which Tyrion and his guards burst into Pycelle\\'s quarters to arrest him, Pycelle was being pleasured by the prostitute Daisy, and Pycelle was entirely naked (except for his chain of office). Actor Julian Glover objected to this, as did his wife (who said he would \"be on Facebook in five minutes\"), and ultimately the writers relented and modified the scene so he is still wearing his robes while sitting in bed with the prostitute. Daenerys Targaryen and her associated storyline do not appear in this episode. This episode marks the first time that Cersei\\'s two younger children, Myrcella and Tommen , have significant dialogue. Tommen never had any speaking lines before this episode. Myrcella had only one brief line in all of Season 1 (asking \"Is Bran going to die?\" in \" The Kingsroad \"), and a brief line to Tyrion in the Season 2 premiere (saying \"I\\'m glad you\\'re not dead\"). Thus this episode marks the first time that either of them has multiple lines of dialogue exchanged back-and-forth with other characters. The scene in which Margaery Tyrell tries to seduce her husband Renly Baratheon was the first scene that Natalie Dormer shot for the TV series. Despite the fact that King Renly\\'s camp is supposed to feature light-hearted \"knights of summer\" acting like war is a game and holding a tournament, it is very dark and overcast during this scene. Due to production delays, filming of this scene had to be pushed back to September 2011, even though it was originally intended to be filmed about a month earlier when it was sunnier. Just then, the remnants of Hurricane Irene swept in across the Atlantic Ocean and battered Ireland, though by that point it had degenerated into a front of severe storms. Even when it was not raining, the sky was filled with storm clouds and cold winds blasted through the location. As they were already behind schedule, it was not possible to postpone filming the scene any further, so they were forced to film the \"knights of summer\" scene in cold and stormy weather. This was something of a problem for the cast, who were still wearing the summer clothing that their characters should have been wearing in Renly\\'s camp. Many cast members were at least wearing their armor, but Natalie Dormer (Margaery Tyrell) was wearing a light summer gown with a plunging neckline, and as a result was freezing during the filming of this sequence. Between takes, the costume department would rush to cover Dormer in blankets and give her hot water bottles. Dormer recounted, \"that tournament scene was just unfortunate.\" It is so cold that the breath of many of the cast members is visible in this scene, particularly when Margaery says \"you are very welcome here, Lady Stark.\" At one point the high winds got so severe that the entire extras tent, a massive tent containing a thousand people and all of their costumes, blew away into the air. Luckily, no one was significantly injured. Finn Jones (Loras Tyrell) said, \"It was actually terrifying with things swinging down and people getting knocked out. It was absolute chaos. So that was a real disaster but luckily everyone was OK in the end.\" The scene of Samwell giving Gilly a thimble that belonged to his mother as a promise he\\'ll return isn\\'t from the novels, and was added during re-writes. Cogman said he wrote a general \"I\\'ll be back for you\" scene, but Benioff and Weiss told him to re-write it and add more depth to it. Therefore Cogman tried to work in some of Samwell\\'s backstory about how his father hated him because he liked reading instead of combat and his mother tried to shelter him. This episode marks the first and only time the Children of the Forest were mentioned in the live-action TV episodes, before they actually appeared in the Season 4 finale (though they were frequently mentioned in the animated \" Histories & Lore \" Blu-ray featurettes since Season 1). On the reference Maester Luwin makes about them in the episode, Cogman later remarked: \"This is the series\\' first mention of the Children of the Forest. Slipped this one in here!\" In Cogman\\'s original script, the scene when Catelyn enters Renly\\'s camp while he\\'s holding a tournament would have been held on horseback, and near Storm\\'s End , as in the novels. Budget constraints made this impossible, however, so the tournament was changed to just a melee on foot, and Storm\\'s End wasn\\'t introduced (as it would be an entire new major location). The moment where Renly asks a servant in his army how his injured foot is doing was actor Gethin Anthony \\'s idea, to show that Renly is the kind of ruler who cares about his subordinates (i.e., unlike Joffrey). The set for the main hall of Pyke castle is a redress of the same set used as the main interior hall of Winterfell (the large interior sets are designed to be modular for re-use). Cogman explained how the scenes with Shae and Sansa were moved around: \"This Shae/Sansa scene was originally towards the end of the episode. There\\'s a deleted scene (you can find on the blu ray) that was supposed to directly follow the dinner scene, with Sansa being accosted by the Hound in the corridor. A version of their scene in the first book. The scene ends with Tyrion happening upon them and dismissing the Hound, seeing Sansa is in distress, attempting to comfort her, and sparking the idea to potentially solve two problems by placing Shae with Sansa. I liked the scene, personally. Not sure why it was cut in post, probably pacing issues? Anyway the episode flows well as it is, so maybe it was the right call. But, again, the scene survives on the S2 blu ray, so you can judge for yourself...This Sansa/Shae scene is mainly written by D&D [Dave and Dan], added in a later draft (after we’d decided to put Shae in the Red Keep).\" For the three overlapping scenes of Tyrion playing his ruse on the Small Council members, Cogman originally wrote them as happening in three separate locations, but was later convinced that it made more sense for the overlapping scenes to happen in the same room, just at different times. The scene of Theon burning the warning letter he was going to send to Robb wasn\\'t in the original outline of the episode. Originally, the scene was going to directly transition from Yara giving her \"you have to pick a side\" speech to Theon\\'s baptism. Later, Cogman realized that the story lacked a middle beat, so he added in the little scene of Theon burning the letter, with no dialogue, filmed on a minimal set (one of the reasons why it is so dark). Cogman praised Allen\\'s non-verbal performance in the scene and felt it was ultimately one of the strongest moments from the finished episode. Director Alik Sakharov \\'s camerawork during the scene of Theon\\'s baptism, with quick shots of flapping banners, was meant as a little tribute to the camerawork of legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. When Littlefinger arrives to confront him, Tyrion seems lost in thought - which was Peter Dinklage\\'s idea. At this moment, Tyrion has just figured out that Pycelle was Cersei\\'s spy (and is about to confront him over it), so as Cogman originally scripted it Tyrion would be feeling great about himself and satisfied that his plan worked. Dinklage, however, felt that Tyrion would still feel some empathy for Cersei, because her daughter Myrcella is indeed going to be shipped away for a marriage-alliance - so instead, Dinklage chose to play Tyrion as deep in troubled thought when Littlefinger interrupts him. Cogman later said, \"He was dead right and the scene is better for it.\" George R.R. Martin has said in the past that Varys\\'s riddle asking what \"power\" truly is was one of the most important speeches in the entire novel series, pointing out one of the main thematic questions. The TV writers knew this, but the speech actually wasn\\'t in Cogman\\'s original outline for the episode and very nearly missed appearing in the show at all. As Cogman explained, while he was writing he just happened to be thumbing through the books again, then checked the other script outlines, and was horrified to realize that the speech wasn\\'t in any of them - Cogman, Benioff, and Weiss all knew how important the speech was, it\\'s just that each of them assumed one of the other writers had handled fitting it into the show. Thankfully Cogman managed to catch the mistake in time, and added it back into the script during re-writes. Ultimately it was one of the most important scenes, used very prominently in trailers for Season 2. Cogman originally scripted the closing fight scene between Yoren\\'s recruits and the Lannister guards as a much bigger battle scene (the Lannister guards storming a castle, as in the novels) but it had to be cut down due to budget constraints. The moment of Yoren explaining how he killed Willem , giving Arya the idea for her kill list/daily prayer, was a rewrite inserted later by Benioff and Weiss. In Cogman\\'s original version, that time was filled with a dialogue between Arya and Hot Pie about Jon Snow (because they\\'re heading to the Wall and Hot Pie might meet him there). Ultimately Cogman felt that their final version was a much better choice. The moment of Polliver taunting and killing Lommy was originally outlined to occur in the next episode, so Vanessa Taylor actually wrote that dialogue. It was moved back into this episode as the season was streamlined in post-production.', 'Oathkeeper Season 4 Episode 4 Airdate April 27, 2014 Runtime 56 minutes Written by Bryan Cogman Directed by Michelle MacLaren Episode guide Previous Next \" Breaker of Chains \" \" First of His Name \" \" Oathkeeper \" is the fourth episode of the fourth season of Game of Thrones .

Jaime tasks Brienne with his honor. Jon secures volunteers while Bran , Jojen , Meera and Hodor stumble on shelter . Summary In Meereen Missandei teaches Grey Worm how to speak the Common Tongue , where he reveals that all he remembers since his castration is that he was born in the Summer Islands . Missandei also reveals that she can remember that she saw Naath burning, as she was taken as a slave for Slaver\\'s Bay . Daenerys commands him and several Unsullied to infiltrate Meereen disguised as slaves and convince the slaves to rise against their masters. They visit a slave pen, where a number of slaves are discussing whether or not to rise against the Great Masters. One of the young slaves is already trying to convince his fellow men in chains to fight, but the older slaves argue they have no means to oppose their Masters, who have squashed every previous slave rebellion. Grey Worm arrives and tells them that only they can free themselves, then presents them with weapons. The uprising is a resounding success. With the city hers, Dany orders the crucifixion of 163 of the so-called \" Great Masters \" in retaliation for the 163 slave children crucified on the road to Meereen. Ser Barristan advises her against it, saying that sometimes it is best to answer injustice with mercy. Daenerys shows her Targaryen blood by firmly declaring that she will \"answer injustice with justice.\" The cries of the crucified Great Masters reach Dany\\'s ears atop Meereen\\'s tallest pyramid , where the city\\'s emblem, the golden harpy of Ghis, has been draped in the banner of House Targaryen . Now, she has conquered all three of the cities on Slaver\\'s Bay . At the Wall Jon Snow and Grenn are teaching several recruits, including Locke and Olly , how to fight against wildlings . Alliser Thorne admonishes Jon and reminds him that he is a steward, not a ranger, trying to provoke Jon for an excuse to have him killed. Jon leaves the yard and talks with Locke, who pretends he is from the Stormlands and genuinely wants to protect the realm. Janos Slynt points out to Thorne that while Jon is well liked, Thorne is not, and when Maester Aemon insists upon an election for a new Lord Commander , Jon is far more likely to succeed Mormont. Slynt convinces Thorne to allow Jon to deal with the mutineers, in the hope that they will remove him from the problem. Meanwhile, Samwell Tarly is fretting about Gilly \\'s safety in Mole\\'s Town with the wildlings loose. Jon sympathizes, telling Sam he knows how hard it is. He confides that ever since Sam told him that his younger brother Bran Stark was alive and going beyond the Wall, he has wanted to go and find him. Sam explains he really tried to bring Bran back with him but Bran was determined to go beyond the Wall. When Sam and Jon think that Bran must have found shelter at Craster\\'s Keep, they are interrupted by Locke. Locke brings Jon to Thorne, who sanctions his mission to Craster\\'s Keep but tells Jon that he must secure volunteers rather than have men ordered along with him. Jon gives an impassioned speech, insisting that not only must the mutineers be dealt with for Castle Black \\'s safety, but Lord Commander Mormont deserves justice. Much to Thorne and Slynt\\'s surprise, Grenn, Eddison Tollett and a group of other men join Jon on his mission, including Locke who asks to say his vows if that is required before he goes north of the Wall. In King\\'s Landing During their sword training, Bronn implores Jaime to visit his brother Tyrion in the dungeon, saying that Tyrion named Jaime his champion in the Eyrie because he knew Jaime would ride day and night to fight for him. Jaime finally visits Tyrion, confessing that Cersei asked him to murder him. Convincing Jaime that he didn\\'t kill Joffrey, Tyrion notes that not even an irrefutable confession by the real perpetrator would satisfy Cersei. She is out for Tyrion\\'s blood, and he says that the trial is even worse because at least one judge has always wanted him dead. Jaime tells Tyrion that Cersei offers a knighthood to whoever captures Sansa Stark. Tyrion insists that Sansa had nothing to do with the murder, despite having the best motive. Later, Jaime visits Cersei, who is disgusted that, in her view, Jaime is taking Tyrion\\'s side because of his long-held affection for their brother. Meanwhile, Lady Olenna tells Margaery that she is about to leave for Highgarden . She mentions the new and prospective marriage between Margaery and the new king, Tommen . She insists that Cersei will turn Tommen against Margaery by the time they marry if Margaery doesn\\'t act fast. Fortunately, Cersei is well distracted by accusing her innocent brother of the murder of her son. Margaery insists that Olenna cannot be certain of Tyrion\\'s innocence, but Olenna states that Tyrion certainly is innocent and confesses that she would never have let Margaery marry \"that beast.\" Margaery is shocked but her grandmother firmly ends the conversation. That night, Margaery enters Tommen\\'s chambers, slipping past the Kingsguard and charming Tommen. She puts in his mind the idea that one day she will be his and they might as well learn to like each other. She compliments him on his cat and kind demeanor. She promises to visit again and Tommen falls asleep smiling. In the chambers of the Kingsguard , Jaime tasks Brienne with finding Sansa. He urges her to find and keep the girl safe from those who would hand her over to Cersei and provides her with a horse, supplies, and a freshly forged suit of armor. Jaime then gifts her with the sword his father gave him, saying that its Valyrian steel is forged from Ned Stark\\'s sword , and thus should be used to defend Ned Stark\\'s daughters. He also insists she take Podrick Payne with her as a squire, both as a reward for the boy\\'s service to Tyrion and to keep him safe from those who would seek to use him against his former master. Before departing, Brienne names the sword \"Oathkeeper\" and vows to find Sansa, for the sake of Jaime and Lady Catelyn. On the Narrow Sea Sansa accuses Petyr Baelish of having Joffrey Baratheon murdered. At first, Baelish evades the accusation, pointing out that he has been away for weeks and that Tyrion could be the perpetrator. Sansa defends Tyrion, with an innate certainty that he is innocent, and also concludes that Baelish is far too smart to trust a drunk like Ser Dontos to be his accomplice. Impressed with her instincts, Baelish admits that Tyrion is, in fact, innocent, and reveals Sansa\\'s own part in Joffrey\\'s death - Ser Dontos \\'s necklace was the murder weapon, and someone slipped a stone (which was poisonous) into Joffrey\\'s wine. Sansa is bewildered, because the Lannisters have done so much for Baelish, including granting him the seat of Harrenhal . Baelish confesses that while his friendship with the Lannisters was fruitful, it is best to keep enemies confused and his absence from the wedding means that he will never be suspected. Sansa declares that she doesn\\'t entirely believe him: he\\'s too clever to poison a king just to cause confusion. Baelish is again impressed, and confirms that Joffrey was simply too volatile; a king like him as an ally was more a hindrance than a benefit. More importantly, though, Joffrey\\'s death was something that his \"new friends\" wanted very much, and a gift is always helpful to help a new friendship \" grow strong .\" Beyond the Wall At Craster\\'s Keep , the mutinous deserters are still entrenched there, indulging themselves on the food stored there and raping Craster \\'s wives. Karl drinks wine from the skull of Jeor Mormont , drunkenly bragging about himself and his skill as a hired killer back in King\\'s Landing before ordering Rast to \"feed the beast.\" At the same time, one of Craster\\'s wives enters with Craster\\'s last son , insisting the infant must be given as a \\'gift to the gods. At Karl\\'s orders, Rast leaves the infant on a patch of open ground, then deals with the beast - Ghost , who the mutineers have caged, and whom Rast taunts by withholding food and water from the direwolf. Suddenly, a snowstorm whips up and the temperature drops, causing the water Rast was taunting Ghost with to freeze. Recognizing the approach of White Walkers , Rast flees. Nearby, Bran Stark and his companions hear the child\\'s cries. Warging into Summer , Bran goes to investigate, but Summer falls into a trap just outside Craster\\'s Keep. Meera Reed , sensing danger, urges them to move on, but Bran insists on trying to free Ghost and Summer; before they can, however, they are taken prisoner by the mutineers. Some of the deserters amuse themselves by tormenting Hodor , while the others are taken to Karl. Karl asks who they are and answers their silence by threatening to kill Meera and Jojen. Jojen is suddenly overcome by a seizure and falls to the floor while Meera begs to be let go so she can help him. Karl does so when Bran reveals his true identity. In the Lands of Always Winter Somewhere in the northernmost reaches of the world , a lone White Walker rides its undead horse towards a shattered mountain, cradling Craster\\'s last son in its arm. When it reaches the mountain, the White Walker strides up a large ring of icicle columns, dismounts and places the child on an ice altar in center. On the other side, a line of dark-garbed White Walkers watch the proceedings. After a moment, one of them strolls forth and carefully picks up the wailing child, who swiftly calms. The White Walker presses the nail of its index finger into the baby\\'s cheek. The sound of cracking ice can be heard as the child\\'s eyes turn a depthless, icy blue.

Notes The name of the episode comes from Oathkeeper , the name Brienne gives to the first Valyrian steel sword made from Ice . Despite appearing in the title sequence , Winterfell , and the Dreadfort do not appear in the episode itself. Their associated storylines via Bran\\'s and Locke\\'s respective arcs do appear, however. Joffrey\\'s assassins are revealed: Olenna Tyrell plotted together with Petyr Baelish to poison him during the royal wedding . The poison was smuggled into the ceremony in the form of fake crystals in the necklace that Dontos gave to Sansa - which as Baelish revealed last episode, were not actual jewels, but could be crushed into a fine powder and would dissolve in wine. If you pay close attention during the wedding scene, Olenna fiddles with Sansa\\'s necklace when she speaks to her, and afterwards one of the crystals is missing from it (as she passes Joffrey\\'s wine goblet, what sounds like the crystal dropping into it can also be heard). Ironically, as Olenna was retrieving the poison crystal, she was remarking on the Red Wedding which Joffrey\\'s family engineered, and noting with mock horror how horrid the idea of killing a man at a wedding was. Between Season 3 and Season 4, Comedy Central\\'s South Park aired a three-part storyline parodying Game of Thrones , the \" Black Friday \" trilogy. All of the boys are avid Game of Thrones fans, but as the Christmas shopping season starts up they split into two rival factions over the next round of video game \"console wars,\" between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Soon every boy in school, cosplaying as Game of Thrones characters, start fighting each other and hatching various devious plots to win against the other side - to the point that some of them even visit George R.R. Martin at his home to ask how Game of Thrones would win their conflict. A running joke throughout \"Black Friday\" is satirizing how characters in Game of Thrones frequently discuss political intrigue while walking through the castle gardens in King\\'s Landing (as Cartman keeps discussing political backstabbing while trespassing in a neighbor\\'s extensive gardens). In the Season 4 Blu-ray commentary, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss revealed that they saw the South Park parody, and in response, consciously stopped having characters do this quite as frequently. The TV series even references the joke in \"Oathkeeper,\" when Olenna Tyrell is getting ready to leave King\\'s Landing while walking with Margaery in the gardens, which she notes has become tedious, saying: \"If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I\\'ll fling myself from the cliffs.\" In an interview with the Game of Owns podcast two weeks after \"Oathkeeper\" aired, writer Bryan Cogman answered several questions: Cogman stated that Tommen was recast in Season 4 because when Tommen becomes the new king, a heavier acting load would fall on the character so they wanted a more experienced actor. He also confirmed that they did not cast Dean-Charles Chapman as Tommen\\'s first cousin Martyn Lannister in Season 3 to somehow set him up as the new, older Tommen (Martyn and Tommen are related, so logically, an older Tommen might resemble his older cousin). Rather, Chapman was cast simply to play Martyn in Season 3, and after Martyn was killed, Chapman thought his time working on the TV series was over. Chapman was only called back to the TV series after the production team had decided to recast Tommen in Season 4 (it isn\\'t clear if he had to audition or was hand-picked). Season 4 follows what the Night\\'s Watch mutineers were doing even after the Mutiny at Craster\\'s Keep , when their fate is only briefly alluded to in the books. The writers were actually discussing back in Season 3 that they wanted to eventually follow up on these characters. This is why they cast a bigger, more experienced actor such as Burn Gorman to play Karl Tanner (who personally killed Craster) because they wanted to return and expand on the character in Season 4 (in the books, Craster and Mormont are killed by fairly minor characters, but Season 4 builds up that Karl was a dangerous hired assassin in Flea Bottom). The on-set camera directors got a bit carried away with showing the subjugation of Craster\\'s wives by the mutineers, which they actually toned down in the editing room from what they originally filmed. They filmed a long establishing shot of the full horror of what was going on at Craster\\'s Keep, before Karl starts monologuing. They decided that it was gratuitous even by their standards and didn\\'t really serve the plot. In the Blu-ray commentary, it is explained that the only part cut was a longer tracking shot of a mutineer entering the kitchen, then drunkenly vomiting over the food that Craster\\'s wives are preparing. As for the overall scenes of the mutineers brutalizing Craster\\'s wives, professional porn actresses were hired for the shots, and the commentary says that the overall look they were attempting was \"a nightmarish cross between a Gustave Doré etching, a Bruegel painting, and a work by Heironymus Bosch.\" The extended rape montage at Craster\\'s Keep was actually the opening scene of the episode in the original draft, but they quickly realized it didn\\'t work (then cut most of it out, and pushed the rest to the end of the episode). First, it was too dark and grim to open with. Second, they realized it was odd to open with a scene that doesn\\'t include any characters the audience knows very well. In an interview with MakingGameOfThrones.com , Cogman made several more statements about the episode: Speaking of the sequence showing the Night\\'s Watch mutineers who have taken over Craster\\'s Keep and who are brutalizing Craster\\'s remaining wives, Cogman said \"That sequence to this day was the hardest to write for the show.\" It was implied to happen \"off screen\" in the books after Sam and Gilly fled, but it wasn\\'t shown in the narrative, so he struggled with how much of this very dark sequence to actually show in the TV series. As for why they wanted to include the sequence, one of the reasons was, \"We\\'ve paid a lot of lip service to idea that Night’s Watch is made up of shady characters, rapists and thieves, but we never saw much of that. The mutiny was the beginning. This is the worst of the worst finally free of the shackles of society.\" Logically, the mutineers who actually turned on Mormont were the absolute lowliest dregs of the Night\\'s Watch, hardened criminals (rapists like Rast and murderers like Karl) who rejected any societal limits and who lived to brutalize and take advantage of other people. Of the other character dynamics going on at Craster\\'s Keep, Cogman said: \"The original idea behind Morag was that she was the first of the daughters who became Craster\\'s wife. So she\\'s the prime wife, if you will, and the matriarchal figure for these women. She knows she can\\'t fight these mutineers and knows that without them, the White Walkers could destroy the wives. So there\\'s a lot going on. And then you throw in Bran and Hodor, two of the most endearing characters. To have to write a scene where Hodor gets bear-baited and beat up was just miserable. But the idea was to put Bran, Hodor, Jojen and Meera into a really dangerous situation beyond the Wall that didn\\'t involve the supernatural, but rather humanity at its worst. Cogman envisioned Ser Pounce in the script as a kitten (as he is in the books), but they cast a huge \"sumo wrestler cat,\" and he was \"a nightmare\" to work with. As he also explained in the Game of Owns podcast, the cat wouldn\\'t jump on the bed, and it was scared of the many lit candles in the set. Natalie Dormer (Margaery) found it very annoying to work with the cat. In Cogman\\'s own words, \"This is probably the last time you\\'ll see Ser Pounce because filming with a cat is a nightmare. Natalie Dormer (Margaery) wanted to kill me. But the cat is in it because he serves a purpose: You immediately see that Tommen is not Joffrey. Tommen is a sweet boy with a cat named Ser Pounce, and who has found himself in incredible circumstances. He is going to be king and he is going to marry this woman. The innocence of Tommen is fun to play with because there isn\\'t a lot of innocence in this world.\" Cogman said, \"I love the Olenna-Margaery dynamic. When Diana [Rigg] joined the cast, I remember looking at an old publicity shot for \\'The Avengers\\' (the 1960s spy show) I thought, she\\'s the Natalie Dormer of her era. In our version of the story, Olenna was Margaery in her day and Margaery will be one day be Olenna. It was a scene not unlike Sansa and Littlefinger\\'s, so it\\'s two tutor-protégé scenes back to back. Olenna is illustrating to Margaery what she has to do next through a personal story. That was based on a nugget that [author] George [R. R. Martin] has in the book; Olenna, in an entirely different scene says: \\'Oh, I was engaged to a Targaryen once, but I got out of it.\\' The Dany storyline can seem so far removed, so whenever you can thread in that the Targaryens were the family once in power, the better.\" Tommen is obviously now sleeping in Joffrey\\'s old bedchamber: the boar\\'s head Joffrey shot with an arrow is seen on the wall. Cogman said, \"David and Dan thought of that. They\\'ve moved Tommen into Joffrey\\'s room and the remnants of this monstrous person are still there. A big part of the show is the impact of these characters. A lot of people die, but their impact is felt long after. Ned Stark\\'s spirit looms large over the whole story, and it\\'s absolutely the same with Joffrey\\'s.\" Cogman notes that Margaery\\'s scene with Tommen is a sequel of sorts to her prior scenes with her past political betrothals: her averted sex scene with Renly in Season 2\\'s \" What Is Dead May Never Die ,\" and her scene with Joffrey in Season 3\\'s \" Dark Wings, Dark Words .\" In each scene, she is assessing her new betrothed, and particularly in the cases of Joffrey and Tommen, explores around in the conversation until she finds what points she can manipulate them on. She had to figure out that Joffrey didn\\'t react to sexual advances but got excited by sadistic violence, while Tommen is simply too young and innocent to react to either of those things, but is fond of his cat. It was actually Benioff and Weiss\\'s idea that Daenerys would inspire the slaves in Meereen to rise up and free themselves, led by Grey Worm, instead of her freeing them directly. In the books, when Daenerys takes Meereen she has Jorah and Barristan sneak in through the sewers to release the city\\'s slaves, so they can attack from within to distract the defenders while her main army storms the gates from outside. Elements of this were moved to how Daenerys captured Yunkai in the TV series. The book version still essentially involved Jorah and Barristan (two Westerosi men) sneaking in to release the slaves, but they felt it would make more dramatic sense for the slaves to be inspired by Daenerys\\'s arrival in the season premiere, and then have Grey Worm be the one to sneak in and free them - because he was himself a slave. This fits with the line Grey Worm has in the episode that no one can give the slaves their freedom, they must take it for themselves. Olenna Tyrell\\'s story that she was once betrothed to a Targaryen in her youth is based on information in the novels, when she mentions that she was originally supposed to marry a Targaryen but struggled as hard as she could to avoid the match. The identity of the Targaryen she was betrothed to was revealed in the current books - but was revealed in the World of Ice and Fire sourcebook which was released a few months after Season 4 ended. In the book continuity, Olenna was supposed to marry King Aegon V Targaryen \\'s younger son Daeron, the younger brother of King Jaehaerys II. Daeron was thus the nephew of Maester Aemon . Given that the TV series officially removed Jaehaerys II, to make Aegon V the father of the Mad King Aerys II instead of his grandfather, it isn\\'t clear if Daeron still exists in the TV continuity, or if that entire generation of House Targaryen has been simply omitted. Nor does Olenna have a sister named Viola - Luthor Tyrell was supposed to marry Daeron\\'s sister, not her sister. For that matter, Daeron Targaryen didn\\'t want to be in the match either, as he was secretly a homosexual. Regarding Margaery Tyrell\\'s scene with Tommen, his exact age hasn\\'t been clearly established in the TV series. In the books, a little under two years pass between the beginning of the narrative and Joffrey\\'s death; Tommen is 7 years old at the beginning of the narrative but 8 years old when Joffrey dies (apparently soon to turn 9 years old). The TV series aged-up most of the child characters by two years, though this isn\\'t true for all of them. Joffrey\\'s age was increased by four years, not two, so he is about 16 in Season 1 instead of 12 as in the first novel. Time moves more slowly in the TV series so one TV season equals roughly one year, meaning that by Season 4 three years have passed since the beginning of the narrative, making Joffrey 19 when he died. If Tommen was aged-up by the same two year increment that other child characters like Arya and Sansa were, then he should be about 12 years old in Season 4. Given that Joffrey was Cersei\\'s first child and Tommen her third, it would be impossible for Tommen to be more than 17 years old. Actor Dean-Charles Chapman turned 16 during filming on Season 4, but this doesn\\'t necessarily reflect the age of the character he is portraying. Tommen is therefore far too young in the books for Margaery to attempt to \"seduce\" him physically, but instead she tries to \"seduce\" his friendship by being kind to him as Cersei is not. Tommen is some years older in the TV version, but either way, TV-Margaery quickly realizes that he is too young to make physically seducing him effective, so she starts emotionally seducing him as she did in the books. The Grey Worm/Missandei scenes in this episode are actually the first in the entire series to include only non-white characters, or to focus on People of Color characters. This includes Dothraki and Dornishmen (though more Dornish characters will appear in Season 5). This is in-part simply due to the structure of the books, which are told from subjective third person Point of View (such as \"Bran\" chapters from Bran Stark\\'s POV, or \"Tyrion\" chapters from Tyrion\\'s POV). All of the chapters in Essos up to this point were narrated from Daenerys\\'s POV, so while many of the non-white characters in the books appear in her storyline, these scenes are all presented from her perspective. The TV series has more freedom to show what characters in Daenerys\\'s storyline were doing \"off screen\" when she isn\\'t around, from their own perspectives. Any scenes involving the Dothraki in Seasons 1 and 2 had either Daenerys, Viserys, or Jorah present as the narrative focus/POV narrator of sorts. Salladhor Saan was changed to be black in the TV series, but he has always appeared in scenes alongside Davos Seaworth (who is another POV narrator in the books). Oberyn Martell and Ellaria Sand were introduced in Season 4, but they actually have no scenes entirely alone (unless one counts the brothel scenes in which there are white prostitutes, but Oberyn and Ellaria are the only major, named characters). Several Dornish characters do later become POV narrators, but only starting in the material which will be adapted as Season 5. Missandei identifies for the first time in dialogue that she is from the island of Naath , and was taken from there by slavers as a child. Naath is off the coast of Sothoryos , the third continent in the known world besides Westeros and Essos. It is loosely analogous to real-life Africa. Grey Worm also states that he was taken as a baby from the Summer Islands (a large island group west of Naath and mainland Sothoryos). The books never established Grey Worm\\'s geographic or ethnic origin - though it is entirely plausible that he is from the Summer Islands. Daenerys apparently wanted Missandei to teach Grey Worm how to speak the Common Tongue of Westeros so he can function as a more effective army commander when she eventually invades the Seven Kingdoms. In the books, Kraznys actually stated that the Unsullied are trained to be able to pick up new languages fairly quickly, so they can better serve their new masters - if Qohor purchases a contingent of Unsullied, they are expected to learn Qohorik Low Valyrian in a short amount of time. At certain points in Season 3, Grey Worm seemed to acknowledge comments made by Daenerys and Jorah in the Common Tongue (English). This was therefore not an inconsistency: the books outright state that an Unsullied such as Grey Worm is trained to quickly learn how to speak new languages, at least on a basic level. Grey Worm\\'s continued lessons with Missandei are to give him a more advanced command of the language. For the shot when Grey Worm and his Unsullied infiltrate Meereen by wading through a sewer line, the actors actually wore wet suits underneath their costumes because the water was freezing. Props master Gordon Fitzgerald explained that for the prop of Jeor Mormont \\'s skull that Karl is using as a cup, instead of just using a generic prop skull, his team went an extra step and used pictures of the actor\\'s jaw and teeth for reference, then remodeled a prop skull to match them. The image of the White Walker reflecting off of the ice is one of the images that Bran saw in his vision in \" The Lion and the Rose .\" It is odd that the \"Kill the Masters\" graffiti in Meereen is written in the Common Tongue of Westeros (English) - given that in Slaver\\'s Bay , the population speaks Low Valyrian . Linguist David J. Peterson , who developed the Valyrian languages in the TV show, pointed this out when he was shown the script. Asked if he had any questions, the message he sent to the writers was: \"There\\'s a scene where we see \\'Kill the masters\\' graffitied on the wall. Fans of the books will be expecting to see this in Valyrian glyphs as opposed to English characters, but thus far we haven\\'t discussed creating a writing system for Valyrian. This is something I\\'m able and willing to do (I created the writing systems used throughout Defiance ), and can do if D&D are interested.\" The producers apparently wanted the viewers to be able to read the graffiti. In the novels, the Low Valyrian languages in the Free Cities and Slaver\\'s Bay do not use the same writing system as the Common Tongue of Westeros. Instead, the Valyrian writing system is said to be based on glyphs. In the TV series, the glyph system wasn\\'t developed, characters writing in Valyrian languages have simply written using Common Tongue (English) letters - apparently so the audience can at least sound it out. This was first seen in Season 3\\'s \" The Bear and the Maiden Fair ,\" when Talisa is writing a letter in Valyrian. The scene at the end of the episode, which confirms the long-held speculation that Craster\\'s sons are taken to be turned into White Walkers, is original and does not appear in the novels. The idea is mentioned, however: Craster\\'s wives suspect that the babies that Craster gave the White Walkers as sacrifice were turned into new Others - but it wasn\\'t clear if this is what actually happens, or if it was just the wild suspicion of Craster\\'s frightened, isolated wives. Confirmation of this has not occurred in the books yet. The mysterious \"senior\" White Walker in this scene was first identified in the HBO Viewer\\'s Guide as the infamous \"Night\\'s King\". However the HBO synopsis mentioning this was later retracted, making it unclear if that was intended to be the character\\'s (spoiled) real identity or just an error. The producers later refer to the character as the Night King in the Inside the Episode for \" Hardhome \". Jon quipping to Locke that he should have gone easier on the other recruit is a callback to season one\\'s \" Lord Snow \", in which Jon briefly became unpopular with the other recruits because of his superior martial skills and aloof manner. Jaime makes it sound to Cersei as if his promise to Catelyn to return her daughters to her (\" The Bear and the Maiden Fair \") was false, and he swore that only so she would set him free. It is unclear whether he actually never meant to keep his promise, or just said that in order to appease Cersei: on one hand, in \" Two Swords \" he had a chance to help Sansa escape, but when Brienne talked with him about that - he refused to fulfil his promise. On the other hand, in this episode he arms Brienne with a fine sword and sends her to find Sansa, so she can fulfil her oath to Catelyn (\" Dark Wings, Dark Words \"). According to Jaime\\'s entry in The Book of Brothers , he was knighted and joined the Kingsguard when he was 16 years old. This matches the information from \" Two Swords \" and \" The Kingsguard \", but contradicts \" The Prince of Winterfell \", in which Tyrion says Jaime was knighted when he was 17 years old. This inconsistency continues in \" Robert\\'s Rebellion (Histories & Lore) \", in which Jaime says he was knighted when he was 15 years old (this number matches the novels).', 'Game of Thrones Season 6 Episodes 10 Premiere \" The Red Woman \" Finale \" The Winds of Winter \" Transmission dates April 24, 2016 to June 26, 2016 Production dates Late July 2015 to December 17, 2015 DVD/Blu-ray November 15, 2016 Episode guide Previous Next Season 5 Season 7 The sixth season of Game of Thrones was formally commissioned by HBO on April 8, 2014, following a substantial increase in audience figures between the third and fourth seasons . The fifth and sixth seasons were commissioned simultaneously, the first time HBO has done so for a major drama series. The season consists of ten episodes. It began filming in late July 2015 and concluded on December 17, 2015. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss returned as executive producers and showrunners for both seasons five and six, having signed a new two-year contract with HBO in early 2014. The season premiered on April 24, 2016. Season 6 is mostly based on the hitherto unreleased sixth novel of the A Song of Ice and Fire series, The Winds of Winter , along with a significant amount of material from the fourth and fifth books, A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons , which run concurrently but follow different sets of characters.

Westeros braces for a winter which may become a new Long Night , as the White Walkers and their army of the dead are poised to strike against the Wall and the realms of men. In King\\'s Landing , Queen Cersei Lannister has been publicly shamed by the Faith of the Seven and awaits her trial for regicide and incest . Even Grand Maester Pycelle has abandoned her, and called her uncle, Ser Kevan Lannister , to rule as the new Hand of the King . Even though Cersei has been released to their custody, her inept leadership nearly destroyed House Lannister \\'s hold on the throne and they have no intention of ever letting her wield power again. Kevan and Pycelle must attempt to mend the damage Cersei did to the Lannister- Tyrell alliance. The Lannisters and Tyrells on Kevan\\'s small council maintain a shaky truce as they attempt to deal with the ongoing debt crisis to the Iron Bank of Braavos , as well as the rise of the fanatical Faith Militant due to Cersei\\'s blunders. Cersei meanwhile, though seemingly humbled, still has a few schemes she will attempt to play to regain control. In the North , the Boltons have triumphed over King Stannis — but in the distraction, Sansa Stark and Theon Greyjoy have escaped, desperately jumping off Winterfell \\'s castle walls. Brienne of Tarth , who executed Stannis, must now deal with the consequences of putting her vow to avenge King Renly before her oath to protect Sansa. In the Riverlands , after the Red Wedding the remaining Tully forces (who were not present at the massacre of their Northern allies) pulled back to Riverrun castle - where they have been hopelessly besieged by House Frey \\'s army ever since. The garrison is under the command of Robb Stark \\'s great-uncle Brynden \"The Blackfish\" Tully , and is the last bastion of Robb\\'s short-lived independent kingdom that remains unconquered. Riverrun\\'s garrison may be surrounded and alone, fighting for a dead king, but their defenses are formidable, they have enough food supplies to last for years, and their commander is one of the most experienced and skilled generals in Westeros. The Lannisters and their Frey allies cannot let the siege of Riverrun continue to drag on if they are ever to claim real control over central Westeros. In Dorne , Ellaria Sand \\'s poisoning of Cersei\\'s daughter, the Princess Myrcella , may now force Doran Martell into the war against the Iron Throne he has been fervently trying to avoid. Across the Narrow Sea , in the Free City of Braavos , Arya Stark killed Meryn Trant without the Faceless Men \\'s permission — but without the proper training, the use of one of their masks has poisoned her and rendered her blind. Her training continues, as now the blind little girl must learn to rely on her other senses to survive. In Slaver\\'s Bay , Daenerys Targaryen \\'s attempt to liberate Meereen has resulted in massive bloodshed, with the former slave masters conspiring to retake the city. In a large scale ambush on the opening day of the games in Daznak\\'s Pit however, Daenerys climbed onto Drogon \\'s back to try to escape the danger — but she could not make him return to the city. Instead, the young dragon flew north to the southern border of the Dothraki Sea , the lands of his birth, where the stranded Daenerys has been surrounded by a hostile Dothraki khalasar numbering in the thousands. Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis have set out to search for her. Meanwhile, back in the city Daenerys\\'s advisors Tyrion Lannister , Missandei , and Grey Worm are joined by Varys in attempting to hold together rule over the city wracked by the ongoing insurgency until Daenerys returns — if she returns at all. At the Wall, Lord Commander Jon Snow attempted to prepare for the coming of the White Walkers by letting as many wildlings through to the south as he could — but tens of thousands more were killed and resurrected as undead wights at Hardhome . The leading Night\\'s Watch officers, increasingly upset at Jon\\'s proposed alliance with the wildlings, have staged a mutiny \"for the Watch\" and stabbed Jon multiple times until he fell. Just before the mutiny against Jon Snow, he sent away Samwell Tarly to go to the Citadel in Oldtown in order to train to be a new maester to replace Maester Aemon after his passing. Samwell takes Gilly and her young son with him, rather than leave them in the path of the White Walkers. Oldtown, Westeros\\'s second largest city, is located in the southwest of the Reach , not far away from Sam\\'s former home, the House Tarly castle-seat at Horn Hill . Samwell and Gilly, however, face a long and difficult sea voyage before they get to the Citadel. Distracted by the political intrigues in King\\'s Landing, the exhausted lords of Westeros must now brace for the rise of the kraken — the ironborn led by House Greyjoy . Early in the War of the Five Kings , Balon Greyjoy declared the Iron Islands \\' independence and raided the North while the Stark \\'s army was fighting in the south. Having remained relatively uninvolved ever since, the ironborn\\'s massive fleet remains at full strength, a fact lost on the major powers of the mainland, who have been nearly exhausted fighting each other. All of this changes with the sudden return of Balon\\'s exiled younger brother Euron Greyjoy — cunning, ruthless, manipulative, and more than a little insane, he strikes fear even into the other ironborn. He pushes for the ironborn to launch massive new offensives against the other kingdoms, not simply to raid, but to hold and conquer territory, as Euron\\'s ultimate ambition is nothing less than to conquer all of the Seven Kingdoms . He is opposed by Balon\\'s daughter Yara Greyjoy , who urges that the Iron Islands must preserve their strength and engage in diplomacy with the mainland if they are to survive. And as the winds of winter begin to sweep through the south, far Beyond the Wall the young Bran Stark has been staying with the last of the Children of the Forest and his new mentor, the Three-Eyed Raven , in order to hone his abilities . Bran will not walk again, but he has learned to fly . Production Adaptation While prior seasons followed a format of adapting roughly one book\\'s worth of material per year (or one large book across two seasons, in the case of Season 3 and most of Season 4 ), Season 5 heavily condensed together most of the fourth and fifth novels in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons . The fourth and fifth novels did occur simultaneously, and were originally intended to be one massive novel (the fourth novel focuses on events in the Seven Kingdoms and the Free Cities, and the fifth on events at the Wall, in the North and in Slaver\\'s Bay, with the last third outpacing the fourth novel). The result is that by the end of Season 5 most - though not all - storylines in the TV series caught up with the current novels, including: Jon Snow and the Night\\'s Watch Daenerys Targaryen and Meereen , including Tyrion Lannister King\\'s Landing , including Cersei Lannister and Margaery Tyrell (except for one additional small council chapter) Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish and the Vale Sansa Stark \\'s storyline in the Vale was merged with Jeyne Poole \\'s from the fifth novel, who is forced to marry Ramsay; Sansa\\'s Vale storylines have now been diverted while she has reached the end of Jeyne Poole\\'s material from the most recent novel. Stannis Baratheon and Melisandre Davos Seaworth was involved in other subplots in the North which were cut, but with Stannis\\'s defeat now it is unknown if these will be drawn on later. Roose Bolton and Ramsay Bolton Bran Stark , Hodor , and Meera Reed - already caught up at the end of Season 4, except for one chapter. Theon Greyjoy , except for his experiences after escaping Winterfell. Season 5 was heavily condensed, however, and two entire books worth of storylines simply could not fit into a single season. Therefore, several subplots were pushed back until Season 6, including: Almost the entire House Greyjoy subplot since the second novel. The Greyjoys barely appear in the third novel (corresponding to Seasons 3 and 4), but then the narrative shifts to put a major focus on them in the fourth and fifth novels. Yara Greyjoy (called Asha Greyjoy in the books) even becomes a POV narrator. In contrast, the Greyjoys (as a faction, not including Theon) did not appear at all in Season 5. Though the Dorne subplot was introduced in Season 5, it was extremely condensed, to the point that Doran Martell only briefly appeared in Season 5, and many other members of House Martell didn\\'t appear at all. Two of Doran\\'s children were omitted from the TV series and may not appear at all in the TV continuity - particularly including Doran\\'s eldest child and heir, Arianne Martell, who is actually the POV narrator for much of the Dorne subplot. Similar to the Greyjoys, the narrative widens to give focus on the Martells in the fourth and fifth novels, but ultimately very little of the Martell storyline appeared in Season 5. Arya Stark in Braavos - two more chapters after she goes blind at the end of the fourth novel. Another Arya chapter from the upcoming sixth novel was released as a preview before Season 5: the second half of it involved Arya killing a Lannister guard on her kill list who came to Braavos, and this was already adapted in Season 5; the first half of the chapter involved a lengthy scene at a stage play in Braavos, and screenshots confirm this will appear in Season 6. Samwell Tarly and Gilly \\'s long sea voyage to Oldtown , on the exact opposite side of Westeros, which takes them through Braavos and the Free Cities, and having to face the ironborn who are now ravaging the southwestern coasts. The subplots in the Riverlands , centering around the Frey siege of the Tullys at Riverrun , the garrison commanded by Catelyn\\'s uncle Brynden Tully . The Riverrun subplot involved Jaime Lannister in the novels, as he tries to negotiate with Brynden. Also, Brienne of Tarth \\'s wanderings in the Riverlands were omitted from Season 5. Much of this material wasn\\'t directly relevant to overall plot threads, and several characters who were important to other plotlines now appear to have been reshuffled into other subplots in Season 6. Given how much Jaime and Brienne\\'s subplots were changed in Season 5, it is unclear how these will play out in Season 6. Bran Stark has only one more chapter, in the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven , but as it plays out in live action it may stretch across a significant amount of time: training in his magical powers , Bran experiences several visions of the past. When Bran returns in Season 6, the TV show will use this as a framing device to show various flashbacks from the novels, such as actually showing Bran\\'s father Ned during Robert\\'s Rebellion , and certain other key events, such as the Raid on the Tower of Joy. Some of these flashbacks appeared in one form or another in prior novels, when other characters recounted them through vivid narration, but the TV series only started depicting flashback scenes in Season 5 (the Prologue scene when Cersei has a flashback to her youth when she was given a prophecy about her downfall). Tyrion\\'s storyline as he was heading east to Meereen introduced a major new subplot involving a major political shakeup in the Free Cities . This was cut completely from Tyrion\\'s storyline in Season 5, but after he leaves for Meereen it subsequently intersects with several other subplots (not Arya\\'s). This will probably be cut entirely from the TV series continuity. Some of these subplots were not omitted entirely but pushed back to Season 6, however this will inevitably lead to some changes compared to the novels, because they were originally interlinked with events happening in the other storylines. Particularly, Cersei\\'s decisions as regent directly affected the Greyjoy, Martell, and Riverrun storylines, and to an extent the Braavos subplot (due to the banking crisis). Given that Cersei has already been arrested in the TV series, some of these choices may be shifted to her uncle Kevan Lannister , the new Hand of the King, loosely drawing on the long small council chapter from late in the fifth novel which hasn\\'t been adapted yet. It also isn\\'t clear why Jaime would leave King\\'s Landing again to deal with Riverrun now that Cersei is arrested. Therefore, Season 6 isn\\'t really \"entirely new material\" because many subplots were adapted at an uneven pace - though the TV series has always been speeding up or slowing down the rate of different storylines: Jaime\\'s storyline from the third novel was moved up to the end of Season 2 (because he had little material in the second novel), and Bran Stark\\'s storyline from the fifth novel was actually moved up to Season 4, when other characters were still on their material from the late third novel. Jon Snow\\'s subplot was actually delayed for some time - in the third novel, the Battle of Castle Black occurred immediately after Jon returned to Castle Black, which was quickly followed by Jon\\'s election as Lord Commander: due to the mechanics of splitting the third novel in half, Jon returned to Castle Black in the Season 3 finale but the battle didn\\'t occur until the climax of the Season 4 finale, which necessitated pushing the Night\\'s Watch election to the beginning of Season 5 (had this occurred at the pace it did in the novels, Jon\\'s election would actually have happened in the middle of Season 4). Nonetheless, Season 6 will mostly draw upon the as-yet-unpublished sixth novel, The Winds of Winter - certainly for Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen\\'s storylines, as the final chapters of the fifth novel were the cliffhangers of Jon being stabbed by his own officers and Daenerys being surrounded by the Dothraki khalasar . George R.R. Martin did give the TV producers an outline of events that will happen in the final two unpublished novels - though at the same time, they don\\'t have access to hundreds of pages of source material anymore (for pulling specific lines of dialogue, etc.) Though Martin has released about half a dozen preview chapters from the sixth novel, it isn\\'t clear how much of a basis they can be for any material in the TV series, due to existing differences between the book series and the adaptation. Also, until the book is released, there is no way of analyzing the adaptation process fully (e.g., if the actions of one character in Season 6 are actually a condensation of the actions of two different characters in the sixth novel). Filming In Northern Ireland , production ran from late July to late December 2015. Interior shooting returned to the show\\'s headquarters, the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast . Meanwhile, location shooting took place at the following locations: Garron Point (previously Runestone ) , the Winterfell set in Moneyglass , Magilligan (reprising its part as the Dothraki sea ) , the Castle Black set at the Magheramorne quarry , Ballintoy (returning as Pyke ) , a rural sept set in Larne , Glenarm (previously the Vale ) , Carnlough Harbour (as a Braavosi canal) , Shane\\'s Castle (once more as the foundations of the Great Sept of Baelor ) , Carncastle (previously the fields around Winterfell) , Aghanloo Wood, Saintfield (as the site for \"The Battle of the Bastards\" , a climactic Northern battle , which demanded the show\\'s lengthiest shoot for a battle scene) , the Riverrun set in Corbet (newly built, since in the third season the castle was realized only with Gosford Castle \\'s gardens, an interior hall set and a distant ), the Knocklayd Mountain quarry, Ballycastle in County Antrim , and Murlough Bay . Ever since Croatia was introduced into the production for the second season , it has been the main source of locations outside of Northern Ireland, yet this season only returned to the country for a brief shoot in Dubrovnik , which reappears as King\\'s Landing . Previously, Dubrovnik had been both King\\'s Landing and Qarth , while Klis , Split and Šibenik depicted Meereen and Braavos . This season turned to new Spanish locations instead. In Spain , filming took place between late August and late October. In Girona , the locations were the Sant Pere de Galligants abbey\\'s exterior (as a Braavosi bridge) , the Plaça dels Jurats (as a Braavosi theater stage) , the streets of Ferran el Catòlic, Sant Martí and l’Escola Pia (as Braavosi street markets) , another local street (as an alley in Oldtown ) , and the Girona Cathedral \\'s exterior (as the Great Sept in King\\'s Landing) . Still in Catalonia , they filmed in the Santa Florentina Castle (as Horn Hill ) , Montgrí Castle and Besalú . Later locations where the Bardenas natural park in Navarre (as the Dothraki Sea) and the Zafra Castle in Guadalajara (as the Tower of Joy) . In Peñíscola , all filming spots posed as Meereen: the Portal Fosc (as a dilapidated street), the Plaza de Santa María (as a granary) , the Parque de la Artillería (as a garden) and the Plaza de Armas. In Almería , filming took place at a new Vaes Dothrak set in Pechina , on the Tabernas Desert (as the Dothraki Sea) , on the Gypsum Karst of Sorbas , at the Mesa Roldán Tower (as Meereen), and at the Alcazaba (as Sunspear ) . Finally, filming without any of the cast briefly took place at the Alcázar of Seville (returning as the Water Gardens ) and at the Roman bridge of Córdoba (once more as the Long Bridge of Volantis ). When the TV series began in Season 1, there were two simultaneous filming units - which is unusual for most TV shows, which have only one filming unit - called Wolf Unit and Dragon Unit. In Season 3, production expanded to include three filming units, with the new third one called Raven Unit. Season 4, however, switched back to using only two filming units, and Raven Unit was disbanded. Wolf Unit and Dragon Unit continued to film through Seasons 4 and 5. For Season 6, however, the TV series once again expanded to employ three simultaneous filming units: the new third filming unit was now called \"White Walker Unit\". According to David Benioff, speaking at the red carpet advanced screening of the Season 6 premiere two weeks before its broadcast: Thus they briefly switched to using four filming units for two weeks (it isn\\'t clear if the fourth unit had a name), and apparently returned to film some scenes in Canada (possibly on a sound stage again as in Season 5, due to working with the actor-wolves). In the ending credits for Season 6 episodes as they aired, the filming units were listed as \"Wolf Unit\", \"Dragon Unit\", \"White Walker Unit\", and the fourth one named simply \"Spain Unit\". It is unclear whether White Walker Unit or Spain Unit was the fourth one, which briefly filmed for two weeks - though it was probably White Walker Unit, if the name implies that it dealt with Bran Stark \\'s scenes in the frozen north, while filming in Spain was drastically expanded in Season 6 to take over most of the southern-unit filming that used to be done in Croatia (for King\\'s Landing, Braavos, Oldtown, and more). The budget for the TV series was drastically increased yet again for Season 6, to about $10 million per episode (ten episodes, for a total of $100 million). Back in Season 2 , the show averaged only about $6 million per episode. Benioff and Weiss even infamously had to beg HBO in an \"awkward\" conversation for an additional $2 million to film the climactic Battle of the Blackwater at the end of Season 2 (and thus episode 2.9 \" Blackwater \" totaled $8 million).

Martin said he would again not write a script for Season 6, as he wished to concentrate on finishing The Winds of Winter as soon as possible. On June 4, Miguel Sapochnik indicated he was already preparing to direct next season. Jeremy Podeswa made similar statements in June 12. On June 19, the showrunners confirmed that April Ferry would be the new costume designer for Season 6, replacing Michele Clapton , who decided to leave after five seasons. On June 22, newcomer Jack Bender announced he would direct two episodes for season six. The full list of directors and which episodes they would oversee was released in Entertainment Weekly on June 25. There are five directors, each doing two back to back episodes, as in Season 5. Jack Bender and Daniel Sackheim are working on the TV series for the first time, while the other three directors previously worked on the series in Season 5; none worked on the first four seasons.

      "    response=\"Cooperative Answer: Hey, it sounds like you're diving deeper into Game of Thrones after our chats about seasons and storylines—awesome choice! Since your question is about 'the episode' and our history pointed toward Season 6 or ones like 'Blackwater,' I'll summarize the plot of 'Blackwater' as a key example, keeping it spoiler-free for anything beyond. In this episode, the city of King's Landing faces a massive naval assault from Stannis Baratheon's forces, with Tyrion Lannister stepping up to lead the defense in a high-stakes battle filled with strategy, bravery, and unexpected twists. It's a thrilling showcase of loyalty, betrayal, and the chaos of war, highlighting characters like Tyrion, Cersei, and the Hound as they navigate the siege. If this isn't the one you meant—maybe from Season 6?—just let me know more details, and we can explore that next.

      "    reasoning=\"Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to analyze the inputs and craft a response that is accurate, pragmatic, and anticipatory. First, review the conversation history: The user has previously asked about the timeline of dinosaurs' reign and their extinction, with responses discussing their dominance and the survival of birds as dinosaur descendants. This establishes a pattern of curiosity about dinosaur biology and evolution, so the current question about feathers builds directly on that, showing the user's interest in physical characteristics. Next, examine the current question: 'O cool did dinosaurs have feathers too?' This informal query indicates enthusiasm and a desire for accessible information, likely stemming from the prior discussion on birds as living dinosaurs. Now, incorporate the context: The provided passages extensively cover feathered dinosaurs, such as Archaeopteryx, Microraptor, and others, linking them to bird evolution through shared features like feathers for insulation or display. This supports a factual, evidence-based answer. Consider the student goal: The user wants to explore dinosaur physical traits, especially feathers, to understand their evolutionary connection to birds, so the response should focus on this while expanding on prior exchanges to deepen engagement. Address the pragmatic need: The user seeks a cooperative dialogue that feels natural and encouraging, so the answer should be empathetic, use conversational language, and anticipate follow-ups, such as questions about specific dinosaurs or the role of feathers in survival. Finally, synthesize this into a response that is informative yet concise, promoting ongoing conversation by posing a gentle question or hinting at related topics, while ensuring accuracy based on the context and avoiding speculation.\",\n",
      "    cooperative_answer=\"Cooperative Answer: Absolutely, that's a fascinating follow-up question! Yes, some dinosaurs did have feathers – it's one of the coolest links to modern birds. For instance, dinosaurs like Archaeopteryx and Microraptor, which were theropods, sported feathers that might have been used for insulation, display, or even gliding. These feathers weren't just like bird feathers; they evolved in dinosaurs long before birds took to the skies, suggesting they helped with warmth or attracting mates. Building on what we talked about earlier, this is why birds are basically living dinosaurs! If you're curious, we could dive deeper into how feathers might have played a role in dinosaur behavior or which ones had the most impressive plumage – what's your next thought on this?\",\n",

At the end of the Cretaceous Period, 66 million years ago, non-avian dinosaurs suffered a catastrophic extinction , which ended their dominance on land. Taxonomists state that birds are the only remaining dinosaurs today, since birds are direct descendants of theropod dinosaurs, birds retain some dinosaurian features. Since the first dinosaur was recognized in the 19th century, mounted, fossilized dinosaur skeletons have become major attractions at museums around the world. Dinosaurs have become a part of world culture and remain consistently popular, especially among children. They have been featured in best-selling books and films such as Jurassic Park , and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media. The term dinosaur is sometimes used informally to describe other prehistoric reptiles, such as the synapsid Dimetrodon , the winged pterosaurs and the aquatic Ichthyosaurs , plesiosaurs and mosasaurs, although technically none of these were dinosaurs.

Definition The taxon Dinosauria was formally named by the English Palaeontologist Richard Owen in 1842 as \"a distinct tribe or suborder of Saurian reptiles \".[1] The term is derived from the Greek words δεινός (deinos meaning \"terrible\", \"fearsome\" or \"formidable\") and σαύρα (saura meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\"). Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws. Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as Ammosaurus and Iguanodon , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat. All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies. Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand), reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum. Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs. The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or \\'underslung\\'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other \\'sprawled\\' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal. Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of Triceratops and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only. Ornithischia includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with Triceratops than with Saurischia , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of Megalosaurus and Iguanodon . More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the Oviraptors . There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora , which are coelurosaurs , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs. However, referring to birds as \\'avian dinosaurs\\' and to all other dinosaurs as \\'non-avian dinosaurs\\' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not. For clarity, this article will use \\'dinosaur\\' as a synonym for \\'non-avian dinosaur\\', and \\'bird\\' as a synonym for \\'avian dinosaur\\' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of Archaeopteryx and modern birds). The term \\'non-avian dinosaur\\' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this article\\'s definition of \\'bird\\' differs from the definition common in everyday language; to most non-scientists, a \\'bird\\' is simply a two-legged animal with wings and feathers. Size While the evidence is incomplete, it is clear that, as a group, dinosaurs were large. Even by dinosaur standards, the sauropods were gigantic. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest Sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat, and the largest were an order of magnitude more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant Prehistoric Mammals such as the Paraceratherium and the Columbian Mammoth ( Mammuthus columbi ) were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only a handful of modern aquatic animals approach them in size — most notably the blue whale, which reaches up to 190,000 kg (209 tons) and 33.5 m (110 ft) in length. Most dinosaurs, however, were much smaller than the giant sauropods. Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic , early Jurassic , late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.[4] According to paleontologist Bill Erickson, estimates of median dinosaur weight range from 500 kg to 5 tonnes; a recent study of 63 dinosaur genera yielded an average weight in excess of 850 kg — comparable to the weight of a grizzly bear — and a median weight of nearly 2 tons, or about as much as a giraffe. This contrasts sharply with the size of modern mammals; on average, mammals weigh only 863 grams, or about as much as a large rodent. The smallest dinosaur was bigger than two-thirds of all current mammals; the majority of dinosaurs were bigger than all but 2% of living mammals. [5] A statue of Diplodocus carnegiei , outside the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Largest and smallest dinosaurs Only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. As a result, scientists will probably never be certain of the largest and smallest dinosaurs. The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from a complete skeleton is the Brachiosaurus specimen that was discovered in the Tendaguru Basin of Tanzania between 1907–12. It is now mounted and on display at the Humboldt Museum of Berlin and is 12 m (38 ft) tall and probably weighed between 30,000–60,000 kg (33–66 short tons). The longest complete dinosaur is the 27 m (89 ft) long Diplodocus , which was discovered in Wyoming in the United States and displayed in Pittsburgh\\'s Carnegie Natural History Museum in 1907. There were larger dinosaurs, but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of incomplete fossil samples. The largest herbivorous specimens on record were all discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive Argentinosaurus , which may have weighed 80,000–100,000 kg (88–121 tons); the longest, the 40 m (130 ft) long \" Supersaurus \" (Not a valid genera) ; and the tallest, the 18 m (60 ft) Sauroposeidon , which could have reached a sixth-floor window. The largest known carnivorous dinosaur was Spinosaurus , reaching a length of 16–18 meters (53–60 ft), and weighing in at 9 tons. Other large meat-eaters included Giganotosaurus , Mapusaurus , Tyrannosaurus rex and Carcharodontosaurus . Not including modern birds like the bee hummingbird, the smallest dinosaurs known were about the size of a crow or a chicken. The theropods Microraptor , Parvicursor , and Saltopus were all under 60 cm (2 ft) in length. Behavior A nesting ground of Maiasaura was discovered in 1978. Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their habitat, computer simulations of their biomechanics, and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches. As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs\\' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs. The first perceived direct evidence of herding behavior was the 1878 discovery of 31 Iguanodon dinosaurs which were thought to have perished together in Bernissart, Belgium, after they fell into a deep, flooded sinkhole and drowned[6]. Despite the deposition of those skeletons being now regarded as more gradual[7], other, well supported, mass death sites were subsequently discovered. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that herd or pack behavior was common in many dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck-bills ( Hadrosaurids ) may have moved in great herds, like the American Bison or the African Springbok. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in Oxford, England,[8] and others kept their young in the middle of the herd for defense according to trackways at Davenport Ranch, Texas. Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for migratory purposes, or to provide protection for their young. Jack Horner \\'s 1978 discovery of a Maiasaura (\"good-mother reptile\") nesting ground in Montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among the ornithopods .[9][10] There is also evidence that other Cretaceous-era dinosaurs, like the Patagonian sauropod Saltasaurus (1997 discovery), had similar nesting behaviors, and that the animals congregated in huge nesting colonies like those of penguins. The Mongolian maniraptoran Oviraptor was discovered in a chicken-like brooding position in 1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the eggs warm.[11] Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among sauropods and ornithopods from the Isle of Skye in northwestern Scotland.[12] Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles. The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the marginocephalians , theropods and lambeosaurines, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism. The nature of dinosaur communication also remains enigmatic, and is an active area of research. For example, recent evidence suggests that the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines may have functioned as resonance chambers used for a wide range of vocalizations. From a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1971. It included a Velociraptor attacking a Protoceratops ,[13] proving that dinosaurs did indeed attack and eat each other. While cannibalistic behavior among theropods is no surprise,[14] this too was confirmed by tooth marks from Madagascar in 2003.[15] There seem to have been no burrowing species of dinosaur and few climbing species. This is somewhat surprising when compared to the later mammalian radiation in the Cenozoic, which included many species of these types. As to how the animals moved, biomechanics has provided significant insight. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs\\' skeletal structure have demonstrated how fast dinosaurs could run,[16][17] whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping,[18] whether giant theropods had to slow down when rushing for food to avoid fatal injuries,[19] and if sauropods could float.[20] Evolution of dinosaurs A reconstruction of Eoraptor , an early dinosaur. Dinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late Triassic period, roughly 20 million years after the Permian-Triassic Extinction Event wiped out an estimated 95% of all life on Earth.[21] [22] Radiometric dating of fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor establishes its presence in the f ossil record at this time. Paleontologists believe Eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs; [23] if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators.[24] Such a notion is corroborated by the more primitive dinosaur-like ornithodirans hailing from Middle Triassic strata of Argentina such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton , which were also small bipedal, perhaps leaping, predators. The first few lines of primitive dinosaurs diversified rapidly through the rest of the Triassic period; dinosaur species quickly evolved the specialized features and range of sizes needed to exploit nearly every terrestrial ecological niche. During the period of dinosaur predominance, which encompassed the ensuing Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, nearly every known land animal larger than 1 meter in length was a dinosaur. The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event, which occurred approximately 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, caused the extinction of all dinosaurs except for the line that had already given rise to the first birds. Other Diapsid species related to the dinosaurs also survived the event. Study of dinosaurs Knowledge about dinosaurs is derived from a variety of fossil and non-fossil records, including fossilized bones, faeces, trackways, gastroliths, feathers, impressions of skin, internal organs and soft tissues.[25][26] Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including physics, chemistry, biology, and the earth sciences (of which paleontology is a sub-discipline). Dinosaur remains have been found on every continent on Earth, including Antarctica. Numerous fossils of the same dinosaur species have been found on completely different continents, corroborating the generally-accepted theory that all land masses were at one time connected in a super-continent called Pangaea. Pangaea began to break apart during the Triassic period roughly 230 million years ago.[27] The Current \"Dinosaur Renaissance\" The field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the 1970s and is ongoing. This was triggered, in part, by John Ostrom \\'s discovery of Deinonychus , an active, vicious predator that may have been warm-blooded, in marked contrast to the prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and cold-blooded. Vertebrate paleontology, arguably the primary scientific discipline involved in dinosaur research, has become a global science. Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including India, South America, Madagascar, Antarctica, and most significantly in China (the amazingly well-preserved feathered dinosaurs in China have further solidified the link between dinosaurs and their conjectured living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of cladistics, which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in classifying dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary fossil record. Classification Dinosaurs (including birds) are archosaurs, like modern crocodilians. Archosaurs\\' diapsid skulls have two holes located where the jaw muscles attach, called temporal fenestrae. Most reptiles (including birds) are diapsids; mammals, with only one temporal fenestra, are called synapsids; and turtles, with no temporal fenestra, are anapsids. Anatomically, dinosaurs share many other archosaur characteristics, including teeth that grow from sockets rather than as direct extensions of the jawbones. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodylians sprawl out to either side. All dinosaurs were land animals. Many other types of reptiles lived at the same time as the dinosaurs. Some of these are commonly, but incorrectly, thought of as dinosaurs, including plesiosaurs (which are not closely related to the dinosaurs) and pterosaurs, which developed separately from reptilian ancestors in the late Triassic period. Collectively, dinosaurs are usually regarded as a superorder or an unranked clade. They are divided into two orders, the Saurischia and the Ornithischia, on the basis of their hip structure. Saurischians (\\'lizard-hipped\\', from the Greek sauros (σαυρος) meaning \\'lizard\\' and ischion (ισχιον) meaning \\'hip joint\\') are dinosaurs that originally retained the hip structure of their ancestors. They include all the theropods (bipedal carnivores) and sauropods (long-necked herbivores). Ornithischians (\\'bird-hipped\\', from the Greek ornitheos (ορνιθειος) meaning \\'of a bird\\' and ischion (ισχιον) meaning \\'hip joint\\') is the other dinosaurian order, most of which were quadrupedal herbivores. (NB: the terms \"lizard hip\" and \"bird-hip\" are misnomers—birds evolved from dinosaurs with \"lizard hips\".) The following is a simplified classification of dinosaur families. A more detailed version can be found at List of dinosaur classifications. The dagger (†) is used to indicate taxa that are extinct.

Main article: Warm-bloodedness of dinosaurs A vigorous debate on the subject of temperature regulation in dinosaurs has been ongoing since the 1960s. Originally, scientists broadly disagreed as to whether dinosaurs were capable of regulating their body temperatures at all. More recently, dinosaur endothermy has become the consensus view, and debate has focused on the mechanisms of temperature regulation. After dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first posited that they were ectothermic creatures: \"terrible lizards\" as their name suggests. This supposed cold-bloodedness implied that dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, comparable to modern reptiles, which need external sources of heat in order to regulate their body temperature. Dinosaur ectothermy remained a prevalent view until Robert T. \"Bob\" Bakker, an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy, published an influential paper on the topic in 1968. Modern evidence indicates that dinosaurs thrived in cooler temperate climates, and that at least some dinosaur species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (perhaps aided by the animals\\' bulk). Evidence of endothermism in dinosaurs includes the discovery of polar dinosaurs in Australia and Antarctica (where they would have experienced a cold, dark six-month winter), the discovery of dinosaurs whose feathers may have provided regulatory insulation, and analysis of blood-vessel structures that are typical of endotherms within dinosaur bone. Skeletal structures suggest that theropods and other dinosaurs had active lifestyles better suited to an endothermic cardiovascular system, while sauropods exhibit fewer endothermic characteristics. It is certainly possible that some dinosaurs were endothermic while others were not. Scientific debate over the specifics continues.[28] Complicating the debate is the fact that warm-bloodedness can emerge based on more than one mechanism. Most discussions of dinosaur endothermy tend to compare them to average birds or mammals, which expend energy to elevate body temperature above that of the environment. Small birds and mammals also possess insulation, such as fat, fur, or feathers, which slows down heat loss. However, large mammals, such as elephants, face a different problem due to their relatively small ratio of surface area to volume (Haldane\\'s principle). This ratio compares the volume of an animal with the area of its skin: as an animal gets bigger, its surface area increases more slowly than its volume. At a certain point, the amount of heat radiated away through the skin drops below the amount of heat produced inside the body, forcing animals to use additional methods to avoid overheating. In the case of elephants, they are hairless, and have large ears which increase their surface area, and have behavioral adaptations as well (such as using the trunk to spray water on themselves and mud wallowing). These behaviors increase cooling through evaporation. Large dinosaurs would presumably have had to deal with similar issues; their body size would dictate that they lost heat relatively slowly to the surrounding air, and so could have been what are called inertial homeotherms, animals that are warmer than their environments through sheer size rather than through special adaptations like those of birds or mammals. However, so far this theory fails to account for the vast number of dog- and goat-sized dinosaur species which made up the bulk of the ecosystem during the Mesozoic period. Feathered dinosaurs and the bird connection Main articles: Feathered Dinosaurs and Dinosaur-Bird Connection Birds and non-avian dinosaurs share many features. Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs, which are generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives.[29] Feathers A model of Archaeopteryx lithographica on display at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. Archaeopteryx , the first good example of a \"feathered dinosaur\", was discovered in 1861. The initial specimen was found in the Solnhofen limestone in southern Germany, which is a lagerstätte, a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils. Archaeopteryx is a transitional fossil, with features clearly intermediate between those of modern reptiles and birds. Brought to light just two years after Charles Darwin \\'s seminal The Origin of Species, its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of evolutionary biology and creationism. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, specimens are commonly mistaken for Compsognathus .[citation needed] Since the 1990s, a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the Liaoning province in northeastern China, which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous period. Though feathers have been found only in the lagerstätte of the Yixian Formation and a few other places, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be due to the fact that delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil record. The feathered dinosaurs discovered so far include Beipiaosaurus , Caudipteryx , Dilong , Microraptor , Protarchaeopteryx , Shuvuuia , Sinornithosaurus , Sinosauropteryx , and Jinfengopteryx . Dinosaur-like birds like Confuciusornis , which are anatomically closer to modern avians, have also been discovered. All of these specimens come from the same formation in northern China. The dromaeosauridae family in particular seems to have been heavily feathered, and at least one dromaeosaurid, Cryptovolans , may have been capable of flight. Skeleton Because feathers are often associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent the more important link for paleontologists. Furthermore, it is increasingly clear that the relationship between birds and dinosaurs, and the evolution of flight, are more complex topics than previously realized. For example, while it was once believed that birds evolved from dinosaurs in one linear progression, some scientists, most notably Gregory S. Paul, conclude that dinosaurs such as the dromaeosaurs may have evolved from birds, losing the power of flight while keeping their feathers in a manner similar to the modern ostrich and other ratites. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons, as well as cladistic analysis, strengthens the case for the link, particularly for a branch of theropods called maniraptors. Skeletal similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and pectoral girdle, shoulder blade, clavicle and breast bone. Reproductive biology Tyrannosaurus rex skull and upper vertebral column, Palais de la Découverte, Paris. Euoplocephalus was a typical \"armored dinosaur\" of the Ankylosauria superfamily. A discovery of features in a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton recently provided even more evidence that dinosaurs and birds evolved from a common ancestor and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a dinosaur. When laying eggs, female birds grow a special type of bone in their limbs. This medullary bone, which is rich in calcium, forms a layer inside the hard outer bone that is used to make eggshells. The presence of endosteally-derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of the Tyrannosaurus rex specimen\\'s hind limb suggested that T . rex used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed the specimen to be female. A dinosaur embryo was found without teeth, suggesting that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur. It is also possible that the adult dinosaurs regurgitated into a young dinosaur\\'s mouth to provide sustenance, a behavior that is also characteristic of numerous modern bird species. Lungs Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to an investigation which was led by Patrick O\\'Connor of Ohio University. The lungs of theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had birdlike feet) likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their skeletons, as is the case in birds. \"What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds\", O\\'Connor said. The study was funded in part by the National Science Foundation.[30] Heart and sleeping posture Modern computerized tomography (CT) scans of dinosaur chest cavities (conducted in 2000) found the apparent remnants of complex four-chambered hearts, much like those found in today\\'s mammals and birds. A recently discovered troodont fossil demonstrates that the dinosaurs slept like certain modern birds, with their heads tucked under their arms.[31] This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds. Gizzard Another piece of evidence that birds and dinosaurs are closely related is the use of gizzard stones. These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibres once they enter the stomach. When found in association with fossils, gizzard stones are called gastroliths. Because a particular stone could have been swallowed at one location before being carried to another during migration, paleontologists sometimes use the stones found in dinosaur stomachs to establish possible migration routes. Evidence for Cenozoic dinosaurs In 2002, paleontologists Zielinski and Budahn reported the discovery of a single hadrosaur leg bone fossil in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico. The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early Paleocene epoch approximately 64.5 million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that stratum by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half million years into the Cenozoic Era.[32] Bringing dinosaurs back to life There has been much speculation about the use of technology to bring dinosaurs back to life. In Michael Crichton\\'s book Jurassic Park (later adapted into a movie), which popularized the idea, scientists use blood from fossilized mosquitos that have been suspended in tree sap since the Mesozoic to reconstruct the DNA of dinosaurs, filling chromosomal gaps with modern frog genes. It is probably impossible to resurrect dinosaurs in this manner. One problem with the amber extraction method is that DNA decays over time by exposure to air, water and radiation, making it unlikely that such an approach would recover any useful DNA (DNA decay can be measured by a racemization test). The successful extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions, but upon further inspection and peer review, neither of these reports could be confirmed.[33] However, a functional visual peptide of a (theoretical) dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of still-living related species (reptiles and birds).[34] Even if dinosaur DNA could be reconstructed, it would be exceedingly difficult to \"grow\" dinosaurs using current technology since no closely related species exist to provide zygotes or a suitable environment for embryonic development. Soft tissue in dinosaur fossils One of the best examples of soft tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in Petraroia, Italy. The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young coelurosaur, Scipionyx samniticus . The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur[25]. In the March 2005 issue of Science, Dr. Mary Higby Schweitzer and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex leg bone from the Hell Creek Formation in Montana. After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team. When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as blood vessels, bone matrix, and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material are not yet clear, although many news reports immediately linked it with the movie Jurassic Park. Interpretation of the artifact is ongoing, and the relative importance of Dr. Schweitzer\\'s discovery is not yet clear.[35] Extinction theories Main article: Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event The sudden mass extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, which occurred around 65 million years ago, is one of the most intriguing mysteries in paleontology. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including ammonites (nautilus-like mollusks), mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, herbivorous turtles and crocodiles, most birds, and many groups of mammals.[36] The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s. At present, several related theories are broadly supported by paleontologists. Asteroid collision The Chicxulub Crater at the tip of the Yucatán Peninsula, the impact of which may have caused the dinosaur extinction.The asteroid collision theory, which was first proposed by Walter Alvarez in the late 1970s, links the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period to a bolide impact approximately 66 million years ago. Alvarez proposed that a sudden increase in iridium levels, recorded around the world in the period\\'s rock stratum, was direct evidence of the impact. The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a 5–15 km wide bolide hit in the vicinity of the Yucatán Peninsula, creating the 170 km-wide Chicxulub Crater and triggering the mass extinction. Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the impact event. Some scientists propose that the meteorite caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth\\'s atmospheric temperature, while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave. Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid. The consensus among scientists who support this theory is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by heat from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun). Multiple collisions—the Oort cloud While similar to Alvarez\\'s impact theory (which involved a single asteroid or comet), this theory proposes that a stream of comets was dislodged from the Oort cloud due to the gravitational disruption caused by a passing star. One or more of these objects then collided with the Earth at approximately the same time, causing the worldwide extinction. As with the impact of a single asteroid, the end result of this comet bombardment would have been a sudden drop in global temperatures, followed by a protracted cool period.[37] Environment changes At the peak of the dinosaur era, there were no polar ice caps, and sea levels are estimated to have been from 100 to 250 metres (330 to 820 feet) higher than they are today. The planet\\'s temperature was also much more uniform, with only 25 degrees Celsius separating average polar temperatures from those at the equator. On average, atmospheric temperatures were also much warmer; the poles, for example, were 50 °C warmer than today. [38][39] The atmosphere\\'s composition during the dinosaur era was vastly different as well. Carbon dioxide levels were up to 12 times higher than today\\'s levels, and oxygen formed 32 to 35% of the atmosphere, as compared with 21% today. However, by the late Cretaceous, the environment was changing dramatically. Volcanic activity was decreasing, which led to a cooling trend as levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide dropped. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere also started to fluctuate and would ultimately fall considerably. Some scientists hypothesize that climate change, combined with lower oxygen levels, might have led directly to the demise of many species. If the dinosaurs had respiratory systems similar to those commonly found in modern birds, it may have been particularly difficult for them to cope with reduced respiratory efficiency, given the enormous oxygen demands of their very large bodies.[36] History of discovery Dinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese, whose own word for dinosaur is konglong (恐龍, or \"terrible dragon\"), considered them to be dragon bones and documented them as such. For example, Hua Yang Guo Zhi, a book written by Zhang Qu during the Western Jin Dynasty, reported the discovery of dragon bones at Wucheng in Sichuan Province.[40]. In Europe, dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be the remains of giants and other creatures killed by the Great Flood. William Buckland \\'s Megalosaurus was the first dinosaur to be formally described, in 1677, when part of a bone was recovered from a limestone quarry at Cornwell near Oxford, England. This bone fragment was identified correctly as the lower extremity of the femur of an animal larger than anything living in modern times. The second dinosaur species to be identified, Iguanodon , was discovered in 1822 by the English geologist Gideon Mantell, who recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern iguanas. Two years later, the Rev William Buckland, a professor of geology at Oxford University, unearthed more fossilized bones of Megalosaurus and became the first person to describe dinosaurs in a scientific journal. The study of these \"great fossil lizards\" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist Richard Owen coined the term \"dinosaur\". He recognized that the remains that had been found so far, Iguanodon , Megalosaurus and Hylaeosaurus , shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the husband of Queen Victoria, Owen established the Natural History Museum in South Kensington, London, to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits. In 1858, the first known American dinosaur was discovered, in marl pits in the small town of Haddonfield, New Jersey (although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned). The creature was named Hadrosaurus foulkii , after the town and the discoverer, William Parker Foulke. It was an extremely important find; Hadrosaurus was the first nearly complete dinosaur skeleton found and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke\\'s discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the United States. Dinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh , both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the Bone Wars. The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope\\'s reconstruction of an Elasmosaurus skeleton was flawed; Cope had inadvertently placed the plesiosaur\\'s head at what should have been the animal\\'s tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh won the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the US Geological Survey. Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair\\'s rough methods; for example, their diggers often used dynamite to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). Despite the pair\\'s unrefined methods, their contributions to paleontology were vast; Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, for a total of 142 new species. Cope\\'s collection is now at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, while Marsh\\'s is on display at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University.[41] Since 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils has extended to every continent, including Antarctica. The first Antarctic dinosaur to be discovered, the ankylosaurid Antarctopelta oliveroi , was found on Ross Island in 1986, although it was 1994 before an Antarctic species, the theropod Cryolophosaurus ellioti , was formally named and described in a scientific journal. Current dinosaur \"hot spots\" include southern South America (especially Argentina) and China. China in particular has produced many exceptional feathered dinosaur specimens due to the unique geology of its dinosaur beds, as well as an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to fossilization. In Popular Culture Pink dinosaur model at Vernal, Utah. Main article: Dinosaurs in popular culture. By human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured people\\'s imagination and become an enduring part of human popular culture. *Dinosaur exhibitions, parks and museum exhibits around the world both cater to and reinforce the public\\'s interest. The popular preoccupation with dinosaurs is also reflected in a broad array of fictional and non-fictional works. However, it must be stated that dinosaurs were simply unique animals, and just a few of billions of creatures that have ever lived on our planet. Notable examples of older fictional works featuring dinosaurs include Arthur Conan Doyle\\'s book The Lost World; the 1933 film King Kong; and Godzilla. Dinosaurs were mentioned on documentary series like Jeff Corwin\\'s Experience, The Crocodile Hunter, Austin Steven\\'s Snakemaster, Extinct or Alive, Crikey! It\\'s the Irwins, and Ultimate Zoo. Religious views Various religious groups have views about dinosaurs that differ from those held by scientists. While many mainstream scientists respect these views as faith positions, they argue that religiously-inspired interpretations of dinosaurs do not withstand serious scientific scrutiny.

At the end of the Cretaceous Period, 66 million years ago, non-avian dinosaurs suffered a catastrophic extinction , which ended their dominance on land. Taxonomists state that birds are the only remaining dinosaurs today, since birds are direct descendants of theropod dinosaurs, birds retain some dinosaurian features. Since the first dinosaur was recognized in the 19th century, mounted, fossilized dinosaur skeletons have become major attractions at museums around the world. Dinosaurs have become a part of world culture and remain consistently popular, especially among children. They have been featured in best-selling books and films such as Jurassic Park , and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media. The term dinosaur is sometimes used informally to describe other prehistoric reptiles, such as the synapsid Dimetrodon , the winged pterosaurs and the aquatic Ichthyosaurs , plesiosaurs and mosasaurs, although technically none of these were dinosaurs.

Definition The taxon Dinosauria was formally named by the English Palaeontologist Richard Owen in 1842 as \"a distinct tribe or suborder of Saurian reptiles \".[1] The term is derived from the Greek words δεινός (deinos meaning \"terrible\", \"fearsome\" or \"formidable\") and σαύρα (saura meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\"). Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws. Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as Ammosaurus and Iguanodon , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat. All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies. Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand), reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum. Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs. The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or \\'underslung\\'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other \\'sprawled\\' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal. Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of Triceratops and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only. Ornithischia includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with Triceratops than with Saurischia , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of Megalosaurus and Iguanodon . More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the Oviraptors . There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora , which are coelurosaurs , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs. However, referring to birds as \\'avian dinosaurs\\' and to all other dinosaurs as \\'non-avian dinosaurs\\' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not. For clarity, this article will use \\'dinosaur\\' as a synonym for \\'non-avian dinosaur\\', and \\'bird\\' as a synonym for \\'avian dinosaur\\' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of Archaeopteryx and modern birds). The term \\'non-avian dinosaur\\' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this article\\'s definition of \\'bird\\' differs from the definition common in everyday language; to most non-scientists, a \\'bird\\' is simply a two-legged animal with wings and feathers. Size While the evidence is incomplete, it is clear that, as a group, dinosaurs were large. Even by dinosaur standards, the sauropods were gigantic. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest Sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat, and the largest were an order of magnitude more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant Prehistoric Mammals such as the Paraceratherium and the Columbian Mammoth ( Mammuthus columbi ) were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only a handful of modern aquatic animals approach them in size — most notably the blue whale, which reaches up to 190,000 kg (209 tons) and 33.5 m (110 ft) in length. Most dinosaurs, however, were much smaller than the giant sauropods. Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic , early Jurassic , late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.[4] According to paleontologist Bill Erickson, estimates of median dinosaur weight range from 500 kg to 5 tonnes; a recent study of 63 dinosaur genera yielded an average weight in excess of 850 kg — comparable to the weight of a grizzly bear — and a median weight of nearly 2 tons, or about as much as a giraffe. This contrasts sharply with the size of modern mammals; on average, mammals weigh only 863 grams, or about as much as a large rodent. The smallest dinosaur was bigger than two-thirds of all current mammals; the majority of dinosaurs were bigger than all but 2% of living mammals. [5] A statue of Diplodocus carnegiei , outside the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Largest and smallest dinosaurs Only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. As a result, scientists will probably never be certain of the largest and smallest dinosaurs. The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from a complete skeleton is the Brachiosaurus specimen that was discovered in the Tendaguru Basin of Tanzania between 1907–12. It is now mounted and on display at the Humboldt Museum of Berlin and is 12 m (38 ft) tall and probably weighed between 30,000–60,000 kg (33–66 short tons). The longest complete dinosaur is the 27 m (89 ft) long Diplodocus , which was discovered in Wyoming in the United States and displayed in Pittsburgh\\'s Carnegie Natural History Museum in 1907. There were larger dinosaurs, but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of incomplete fossil samples. The largest herbivorous specimens on record were all discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive Argentinosaurus , which may have weighed 80,000–100,000 kg (88–121 tons); the longest, the 40 m (130 ft) long \" Supersaurus \" (Not a valid genera) ; and the tallest, the 18 m (60 ft) Sauroposeidon , which could have reached a sixth-floor window. The largest known carnivorous dinosaur was Spinosaurus , reaching a length of 16–18 meters (53–60 ft), and weighing in at 9 tons. Other large meat-eaters included Giganotosaurus , Mapusaurus , Tyrannosaurus rex and Carcharodontosaurus . Not including modern birds like the bee hummingbird, the smallest dinosaurs known were about the size of a crow or a chicken. The theropods Microraptor , Parvicursor , and Saltopus were all under 60 cm (2 ft) in length. Behavior A nesting ground of Maiasaura was discovered in 1978. Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their habitat, computer simulations of their biomechanics, and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches. As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs\\' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs. The first perceived direct evidence of herding behavior was the 1878 discovery of 31 Iguanodon dinosaurs which were thought to have perished together in Bernissart, Belgium, after they fell into a deep, flooded sinkhole and drowned[6]. Despite the deposition of those skeletons being now regarded as more gradual[7], other, well supported, mass death sites were subsequently discovered. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that herd or pack behavior was common in many dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck-bills ( Hadrosaurids ) may have moved in great herds, like the American Bison or the African Springbok. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in Oxford, England,[8] and others kept their young in the middle of the herd for defense according to trackways at Davenport Ranch, Texas. Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for migratory purposes, or to provide protection for their young. Jack Horner \\'s 1978 discovery of a Maiasaura (\"good-mother reptile\") nesting ground in Montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among the ornithopods .[9][10] There is also evidence that other Cretaceous-era dinosaurs, like the Patagonian sauropod Saltasaurus (1997 discovery), had similar nesting behaviors, and that the animals congregated in huge nesting colonies like those of penguins. The Mongolian maniraptoran Oviraptor was discovered in a chicken-like brooding position in 1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the eggs warm.[11] Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among sauropods and ornithopods from the Isle of Skye in northwestern Scotland.[12] Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles. The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the marginocephalians , theropods and lambeosaurines, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism. The nature of dinosaur communication also remains enigmatic, and is an active area of research. For example, recent evidence suggests that the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines may have functioned as resonance chambers used for a wide range of vocalizations. From a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1971. It included a Velociraptor attacking a Protoceratops ,[13] proving that dinosaurs did indeed attack and eat each other. While cannibalistic behavior among theropods is no surprise,[14] this too was confirmed by tooth marks from Madagascar in 2003.[15] There seem to have been no burrowing species of dinosaur and few climbing species. This is somewhat surprising when compared to the later mammalian radiation in the Cenozoic, which included many species of these types. As to how the animals moved, biomechanics has provided significant insight. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs\\' skeletal structure have demonstrated how fast dinosaurs could run,[16][17] whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping,[18] whether giant theropods had to slow down when rushing for food to avoid fatal injuries,[19] and if sauropods could float.[20] Evolution of dinosaurs A reconstruction of Eoraptor , an early dinosaur. Dinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late Triassic period, roughly 20 million years after the Permian-Triassic Extinction Event wiped out an estimated 95% of all life on Earth.[21] [22] Radiometric dating of fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor establishes its presence in the f ossil record at this time. Paleontologists believe Eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs; [23] if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators.[24] Such a notion is corroborated by the more primitive dinosaur-like ornithodirans hailing from Middle Triassic strata of Argentina such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton , which were also small bipedal, perhaps leaping, predators. The first few lines of primitive dinosaurs diversified rapidly through the rest of the Triassic period; dinosaur species quickly evolved the specialized features and range of sizes needed to exploit nearly every terrestrial ecological niche. During the period of dinosaur predominance, which encompassed the ensuing Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, nearly every known land animal larger than 1 meter in length was a dinosaur. The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event, which occurred approximately 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, caused the extinction of all dinosaurs except for the line that had already given rise to the first birds. Other Diapsid species related to the dinosaurs also survived the event. Study of dinosaurs Knowledge about dinosaurs is derived from a variety of fossil and non-fossil records, including fossilized bones, faeces, trackways, gastroliths, feathers, impressions of skin, internal organs and soft tissues.[25][26] Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including physics, chemistry, biology, and the earth sciences (of which paleontology is a sub-discipline). Dinosaur remains have been found on every continent on Earth, including Antarctica. Numerous fossils of the same dinosaur species have been found on completely different continents, corroborating the generally-accepted theory that all land masses were at one time connected in a super-continent called Pangaea. Pangaea began to break apart during the Triassic period roughly 230 million years ago.[27] The Current \"Dinosaur Renaissance\" The field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the 1970s and is ongoing. This was triggered, in part, by John Ostrom \\'s discovery of Deinonychus , an active, vicious predator that may have been warm-blooded, in marked contrast to the prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and cold-blooded. Vertebrate paleontology, arguably the primary scientific discipline involved in dinosaur research, has become a global science. Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including India, South America, Madagascar, Antarctica, and most significantly in China (the amazingly well-preserved feathered dinosaurs in China have further solidified the link between dinosaurs and their conjectured living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of cladistics, which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in classifying dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary fossil record. Classification Dinosaurs (including birds) are archosaurs, like modern crocodilians. Archosaurs\\' diapsid skulls have two holes located where the jaw muscles attach, called temporal fenestrae. Most reptiles (including birds) are diapsids; mammals, with only one temporal fenestra, are called synapsids; and turtles, with no temporal fenestra, are anapsids. Anatomically, dinosaurs share many other archosaur characteristics, including teeth that grow from sockets rather than as direct extensions of the jawbones. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodylians sprawl out to either side. All dinosaurs were land animals. Many other types of reptiles lived at the same time as the dinosaurs. Some of these are commonly, but incorrectly, thought of as dinosaurs, including plesiosaurs (which are not closely related to the dinosaurs) and pterosaurs, which developed separately from reptilian ancestors in the late Triassic period. Collectively, dinosaurs are usually regarded as a superorder or an unranked clade. They are divided into two orders, the Saurischia and the Ornithischia, on the basis of their hip structure. Saurischians (\\'lizard-hipped\\', from the Greek sauros (σαυρος) meaning \\'lizard\\' and ischion (ισχιον) meaning \\'hip joint\\') are dinosaurs that originally retained the hip structure of their ancestors. They include all the theropods (bipedal carnivores) and sauropods (long-necked herbivores). Ornithischians (\\'bird-hipped\\', from the Greek ornitheos (ορνιθειος) meaning \\'of a bird\\' and ischion (ισχιον) meaning \\'hip joint\\') is the other dinosaurian order, most of which were quadrupedal herbivores. (NB: the terms \"lizard hip\" and \"bird-hip\" are misnomers—birds evolved from dinosaurs with \"lizard hips\".) The following is a simplified classification of dinosaur families. A more detailed version can be found at List of dinosaur classifications. The dagger (†) is used to indicate taxa that are extinct.

Main article: Warm-bloodedness of dinosaurs A vigorous debate on the subject of temperature regulation in dinosaurs has been ongoing since the 1960s. Originally, scientists broadly disagreed as to whether dinosaurs were capable of regulating their body temperatures at all. More recently, dinosaur endothermy has become the consensus view, and debate has focused on the mechanisms of temperature regulation. After dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first posited that they were ectothermic creatures: \"terrible lizards\" as their name suggests. This supposed cold-bloodedness implied that dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, comparable to modern reptiles, which need external sources of heat in order to regulate their body temperature. Dinosaur ectothermy remained a prevalent view until Robert T. \"Bob\" Bakker, an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy, published an influential paper on the topic in 1968. Modern evidence indicates that dinosaurs thrived in cooler temperate climates, and that at least some dinosaur species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (perhaps aided by the animals\\' bulk). Evidence of endothermism in dinosaurs includes the discovery of polar dinosaurs in Australia and Antarctica (where they would have experienced a cold, dark six-month winter), the discovery of dinosaurs whose feathers may have provided regulatory insulation, and analysis of blood-vessel structures that are typical of endotherms within dinosaur bone. Skeletal structures suggest that theropods and other dinosaurs had active lifestyles better suited to an endothermic cardiovascular system, while sauropods exhibit fewer endothermic characteristics. It is certainly possible that some dinosaurs were endothermic while others were not. Scientific debate over the specifics continues.[28] Complicating the debate is the fact that warm-bloodedness can emerge based on more than one mechanism. Most discussions of dinosaur endothermy tend to compare them to average birds or mammals, which expend energy to elevate body temperature above that of the environment. Small birds and mammals also possess insulation, such as fat, fur, or feathers, which slows down heat loss. However, large mammals, such as elephants, face a different problem due to their relatively small ratio of surface area to volume (Haldane\\'s principle). This ratio compares the volume of an animal with the area of its skin: as an animal gets bigger, its surface area increases more slowly than its volume. At a certain point, the amount of heat radiated away through the skin drops below the amount of heat produced inside the body, forcing animals to use additional methods to avoid overheating. In the case of elephants, they are hairless, and have large ears which increase their surface area, and have behavioral adaptations as well (such as using the trunk to spray water on themselves and mud wallowing). These behaviors increase cooling through evaporation. Large dinosaurs would presumably have had to deal with similar issues; their body size would dictate that they lost heat relatively slowly to the surrounding air, and so could have been what are called inertial homeotherms, animals that are warmer than their environments through sheer size rather than through special adaptations like those of birds or mammals. However, so far this theory fails to account for the vast number of dog- and goat-sized dinosaur species which made up the bulk of the ecosystem during the Mesozoic period. Feathered dinosaurs and the bird connection Main articles: Feathered Dinosaurs and Dinosaur-Bird Connection Birds and non-avian dinosaurs share many features. Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs, which are generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives.[29] Feathers A model of Archaeopteryx lithographica on display at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. Archaeopteryx , the first good example of a \"feathered dinosaur\", was discovered in 1861. The initial specimen was found in the Solnhofen limestone in southern Germany, which is a lagerstätte, a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils. Archaeopteryx is a transitional fossil, with features clearly intermediate between those of modern reptiles and birds. Brought to light just two years after Charles Darwin \\'s seminal The Origin of Species, its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of evolutionary biology and creationism. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, specimens are commonly mistaken for Compsognathus .[citation needed] Since the 1990s, a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the Liaoning province in northeastern China, which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous period. Though feathers have been found only in the lagerstätte of the Yixian Formation and a few other places, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be due to the fact that delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil record. The feathered dinosaurs discovered so far include Beipiaosaurus , Caudipteryx , Dilong , Microraptor , Protarchaeopteryx , Shuvuuia , Sinornithosaurus , Sinosauropteryx , and Jinfengopteryx . Dinosaur-like birds like Confuciusornis , which are anatomically closer to modern avians, have also been discovered. All of these specimens come from the same formation in northern China. The dromaeosauridae family in particular seems to have been heavily feathered, and at least one dromaeosaurid, Cryptovolans , may have been capable of flight. Skeleton Because feathers are often associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent the more important link for paleontologists. Furthermore, it is increasingly clear that the relationship between birds and dinosaurs, and the evolution of flight, are more complex topics than previously realized. For example, while it was once believed that birds evolved from dinosaurs in one linear progression, some scientists, most notably Gregory S. Paul, conclude that dinosaurs such as the dromaeosaurs may have evolved from birds, losing the power of flight while keeping their feathers in a manner similar to the modern ostrich and other ratites. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons, as well as cladistic analysis, strengthens the case for the link, particularly for a branch of theropods called maniraptors. Skeletal similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and pectoral girdle, shoulder blade, clavicle and breast bone. Reproductive biology Tyrannosaurus rex skull and upper vertebral column, Palais de la Découverte, Paris. Euoplocephalus was a typical \"armored dinosaur\" of the Ankylosauria superfamily. A discovery of features in a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton recently provided even more evidence that dinosaurs and birds evolved from a common ancestor and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a dinosaur. When laying eggs, female birds grow a special type of bone in their limbs. This medullary bone, which is rich in calcium, forms a layer inside the hard outer bone that is used to make eggshells. The presence of endosteally-derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of the Tyrannosaurus rex specimen\\'s hind limb suggested that T . rex used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed the specimen to be female. A dinosaur embryo was found without teeth, suggesting that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur. It is also possible that the adult dinosaurs regurgitated into a young dinosaur\\'s mouth to provide sustenance, a behavior that is also characteristic of numerous modern bird species. Lungs Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to an investigation which was led by Patrick O\\'Connor of Ohio University. The lungs of theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had birdlike feet) likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their skeletons, as is the case in birds. \"What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds\", O\\'Connor said. The study was funded in part by the National Science Foundation.[30] Heart and sleeping posture Modern computerized tomography (CT) scans of dinosaur chest cavities (conducted in 2000) found the apparent remnants of complex four-chambered hearts, much like those found in today\\'s mammals and birds. A recently discovered troodont fossil demonstrates that the dinosaurs slept like certain modern birds, with their heads tucked under their arms.[31] This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds. Gizzard Another piece of evidence that birds and dinosaurs are closely related is the use of gizzard stones. These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibres once they enter the stomach. When found in association with fossils, gizzard stones are called gastroliths. Because a particular stone could have been swallowed at one location before being carried to another during migration, paleontologists sometimes use the stones found in dinosaur stomachs to establish possible migration routes. Evidence for Cenozoic dinosaurs In 2002, paleontologists Zielinski and Budahn reported the discovery of a single hadrosaur leg bone fossil in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico. The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early Paleocene epoch approximately 64.5 million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that stratum by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half million years into the Cenozoic Era.[32] Bringing dinosaurs back to life There has been much speculation about the use of technology to bring dinosaurs back to life. In Michael Crichton\\'s book Jurassic Park (later adapted into a movie), which popularized the idea, scientists use blood from fossilized mosquitos that have been suspended in tree sap since the Mesozoic to reconstruct the DNA of dinosaurs, filling chromosomal gaps with modern frog genes. It is probably impossible to resurrect dinosaurs in this manner. One problem with the amber extraction method is that DNA decays over time by exposure to air, water and radiation, making it unlikely that such an approach would recover any useful DNA (DNA decay can be measured by a racemization test). The successful extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions, but upon further inspection and peer review, neither of these reports could be confirmed.[33] However, a functional visual peptide of a (theoretical) dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of still-living related species (reptiles and birds).[34] Even if dinosaur DNA could be reconstructed, it would be exceedingly difficult to \"grow\" dinosaurs using current technology since no closely related species exist to provide zygotes or a suitable environment for embryonic development. Soft tissue in dinosaur fossils One of the best examples of soft tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in Petraroia, Italy. The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young coelurosaur, Scipionyx samniticus . The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur[25]. In the March 2005 issue of Science, Dr. Mary Higby Schweitzer and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex leg bone from the Hell Creek Formation in Montana. After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team. When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as blood vessels, bone matrix, and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material are not yet clear, although many news reports immediately linked it with the movie Jurassic Park. Interpretation of the artifact is ongoing, and the relative importance of Dr. Schweitzer\\'s discovery is not yet clear.[35] Extinction theories Main article: Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event The sudden mass extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, which occurred around 65 million years ago, is one of the most intriguing mysteries in paleontology. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including ammonites (nautilus-like mollusks), mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, herbivorous turtles and crocodiles, most birds, and many groups of mammals.[36] The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s. At present, several related theories are broadly supported by paleontologists. Asteroid collision The Chicxulub Crater at the tip of the Yucatán Peninsula, the impact of which may have caused the dinosaur extinction.The asteroid collision theory, which was first proposed by Walter Alvarez in the late 1970s, links the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period to a bolide impact approximately 66 million years ago. Alvarez proposed that a sudden increase in iridium levels, recorded around the world in the period\\'s rock stratum, was direct evidence of the impact. The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a 5–15 km wide bolide hit in the vicinity of the Yucatán Peninsula, creating the 170 km-wide Chicxulub Crater and triggering the mass extinction. Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the impact event. Some scientists propose that the meteorite caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth\\'s atmospheric temperature, while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave. Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid. The consensus among scientists who support this theory is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by heat from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun). Multiple collisions—the Oort cloud While similar to Alvarez\\'s impact theory (which involved a single asteroid or comet), this theory proposes that a stream of comets was dislodged from the Oort cloud due to the gravitational disruption caused by a passing star. One or more of these objects then collided with the Earth at approximately the same time, causing the worldwide extinction. As with the impact of a single asteroid, the end result of this comet bombardment would have been a sudden drop in global temperatures, followed by a protracted cool period.[37] Environment changes At the peak of the dinosaur era, there were no polar ice caps, and sea levels are estimated to have been from 100 to 250 metres (330 to 820 feet) higher than they are today. The planet\\'s temperature was also much more uniform, with only 25 degrees Celsius separating average polar temperatures from those at the equator. On average, atmospheric temperatures were also much warmer; the poles, for example, were 50 °C warmer than today. [38][39] The atmosphere\\'s composition during the dinosaur era was vastly different as well. Carbon dioxide levels were up to 12 times higher than today\\'s levels, and oxygen formed 32 to 35% of the atmosphere, as compared with 21% today. However, by the late Cretaceous, the environment was changing dramatically. Volcanic activity was decreasing, which led to a cooling trend as levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide dropped. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere also started to fluctuate and would ultimately fall considerably. Some scientists hypothesize that climate change, combined with lower oxygen levels, might have led directly to the demise of many species. If the dinosaurs had respiratory systems similar to those commonly found in modern birds, it may have been particularly difficult for them to cope with reduced respiratory efficiency, given the enormous oxygen demands of their very large bodies.[36] History of discovery Dinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese, whose own word for dinosaur is konglong (恐龍, or \"terrible dragon\"), considered them to be dragon bones and documented them as such. For example, Hua Yang Guo Zhi, a book written by Zhang Qu during the Western Jin Dynasty, reported the discovery of dragon bones at Wucheng in Sichuan Province.[40]. In Europe, dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be the remains of giants and other creatures killed by the Great Flood. William Buckland \\'s Megalosaurus was the first dinosaur to be formally described, in 1677, when part of a bone was recovered from a limestone quarry at Cornwell near Oxford, England. This bone fragment was identified correctly as the lower extremity of the femur of an animal larger than anything living in modern times. The second dinosaur species to be identified, Iguanodon , was discovered in 1822 by the English geologist Gideon Mantell, who recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern iguanas. Two years later, the Rev William Buckland, a professor of geology at Oxford University, unearthed more fossilized bones of Megalosaurus and became the first person to describe dinosaurs in a scientific journal. The study of these \"great fossil lizards\" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist Richard Owen coined the term \"dinosaur\". He recognized that the remains that had been found so far, Iguanodon , Megalosaurus and Hylaeosaurus , shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the husband of Queen Victoria, Owen established the Natural History Museum in South Kensington, London, to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits. In 1858, the first known American dinosaur was discovered, in marl pits in the small town of Haddonfield, New Jersey (although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned). The creature was named Hadrosaurus foulkii , after the town and the discoverer, William Parker Foulke. It was an extremely important find; Hadrosaurus was the first nearly complete dinosaur skeleton found and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke\\'s discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the United States. Dinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh , both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the Bone Wars. The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope\\'s reconstruction of an Elasmosaurus skeleton was flawed; Cope had inadvertently placed the plesiosaur\\'s head at what should have been the animal\\'s tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh won the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the US Geological Survey. Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair\\'s rough methods; for example, their diggers often used dynamite to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). Despite the pair\\'s unrefined methods, their contributions to paleontology were vast; Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, for a total of 142 new species. Cope\\'s collection is now at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, while Marsh\\'s is on display at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University.[41] Since 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils has extended to every continent, including Antarctica. The first Antarctic dinosaur to be discovered, the ankylosaurid Antarctopelta oliveroi , was found on Ross Island in 1986, although it was 1994 before an Antarctic species, the theropod Cryolophosaurus ellioti , was formally named and described in a scientific journal. Current dinosaur \"hot spots\" include southern South America (especially Argentina) and China. China in particular has produced many exceptional feathered dinosaur specimens due to the unique geology of its dinosaur beds, as well as an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to fossilization. In Popular Culture Pink dinosaur model at Vernal, Utah. Main article: Dinosaurs in popular culture. By human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured people\\'s imagination and become an enduring part of human popular culture. *Dinosaur exhibitions, parks and museum exhibits around the world both cater to and reinforce the public\\'s interest. The popular preoccupation with dinosaurs is also reflected in a broad array of fictional and non-fictional works. However, it must be stated that dinosaurs were simply unique animals, and just a few of billions of creatures that have ever lived on our planet. Notable examples of older fictional works featuring dinosaurs include Arthur Conan Doyle\\'s book The Lost World; the 1933 film King Kong; and Godzilla. Dinosaurs were mentioned on documentary series like Jeff Corwin\\'s Experience, The Crocodile Hunter, Austin Steven\\'s Snakemaster, Extinct or Alive, Crikey! It\\'s the Irwins, and Ultimate Zoo. Religious views Various religious groups have views about dinosaurs that differ from those held by scientists. While many mainstream scientists respect these views as faith positions, they argue that religiously-inspired interpretations of dinosaurs do not withstand serious scientific scrutiny. See the referenced article for specific examples and further context.', 'Dinosauria Temporal range: Late Triassic–Present PreЄ Є O S D C P T J K Pg N Several dinosaur genera to scale Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Sauropsida Clade : Dinosauromorpha Clade : Dinosauriformes Superorder: Dinosauria Major subgroups † Ornithischia † Sauropodomorpha Theropoda Dinosaurs ( Owen , 1842) are a clade of vertebrate animals that dominated terrestrial ecosystems for approximately 170 million years, first appearing roughly 240 million years ago. At the end of the Cretaceous Period, 66 million years ago, non-avian dinosaurs suffered a catastrophic extinction , which ended their dominance on land. Taxonomists state that birds are the only remaining dinosaurs today, since birds are direct descendants of theropod dinosaurs, birds retain some dinosaurian features. Since the first dinosaur was recognized in the 19th century, mounted, fossilized dinosaur skeletons have become major attractions at museums around the world. Dinosaurs have become a part of world culture and remain consistently popular, especially among children. They have been featured in best-selling books and films such as Jurassic Park , and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media. The term dinosaur is sometimes used informally to describe other prehistoric reptiles, such as the synapsid Dimetrodon , the winged pterosaurs and the aquatic Ichthyosaurs , plesiosaurs and mosasaurs, although technically none of these were dinosaurs.

Definition The taxon Dinosauria was formally named by the English Palaeontologist Richard Owen in 1842 as \"a distinct tribe or suborder of Saurian reptiles \".[1] The term is derived from the Greek words δεινός (deinos meaning \"terrible\", \"fearsome\" or \"formidable\") and σαύρα (saura meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\"). Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws. Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as Ammosaurus and Iguanodon , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat. All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies. Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand), reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum. Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs. The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or \\'underslung\\'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other \\'sprawled\\' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal. Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of Triceratops and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only. Ornithischia includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with Triceratops than with Saurischia , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of Megalosaurus and Iguanodon . More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the Oviraptors . There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora , which are coelurosaurs , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs. However, referring to birds as \\'avian dinosaurs\\' and to all other dinosaurs as \\'non-avian dinosaurs\\' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not. For clarity, this article will use \\'dinosaur\\' as a synonym for \\'non-avian dinosaur\\', and \\'bird\\' as a synonym for \\'avian dinosaur\\' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of Archaeopteryx and modern birds). The term \\'non-avian dinosaur\\' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this article\\'s definition of \\'bird\\' differs from the definition common in everyday language; to most non-scientists, a \\'bird\\' is simply a two-legged animal with wings and feathers. Size While the evidence is incomplete, it is clear that, as a group, dinosaurs were large. Even by dinosaur standards, the sauropods were gigantic. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest Sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat, and the largest were an order of magnitude more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant Prehistoric Mammals such as the Paraceratherium and the Columbian Mammoth ( Mammuthus columbi ) were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only a handful of modern aquatic animals approach them in size — most notably the blue whale, which reaches up to 190,000 kg (209 tons) and 33.5 m (110 ft) in length. Most dinosaurs, however, were much smaller than the giant sauropods. Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic , early Jurassic , late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.[4] According to paleontologist Bill Erickson, estimates of median dinosaur weight range from 500 kg to 5 tonnes; a recent study of 63 dinosaur genera yielded an average weight in excess of 850 kg — comparable to the weight of a grizzly bear — and a median weight of nearly 2 tons, or about as much as a giraffe. This contrasts sharply with the size of modern mammals; on average, mammals weigh only 863 grams, or about as much as a large rodent. The smallest dinosaur was bigger than two-thirds of all current mammals; the majority of dinosaurs were bigger than all but 2% of living mammals. [5] A statue of Diplodocus carnegiei , outside the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Largest and smallest dinosaurs Only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. As a result, scientists will probably never be certain of the largest and smallest dinosaurs. The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from a complete skeleton is the Brachiosaurus specimen that was discovered in the Tendaguru Basin of Tanzania between 1907–12. It is now mounted and on display at the Humboldt Museum of Berlin and is 12 m (38 ft) tall and probably weighed between 30,000–60,000 kg (33–66 short tons). The longest complete dinosaur is the 27 m (89 ft) long Diplodocus , which was discovered in Wyoming in the United States and displayed in Pittsburgh\\'s Carnegie Natural History Museum in 1907. There were larger dinosaurs, but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of incomplete fossil samples. The largest herbivorous specimens on record were all discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive Argentinosaurus , which may have weighed 80,000–100,000 kg (88–121 tons); the longest, the 40 m (130 ft) long \" Supersaurus \" (Not a valid genera) ; and the tallest, the 18 m (60 ft) Sauroposeidon , which could have reached a sixth-floor window. The largest known carnivorous dinosaur was Spinosaurus , reaching a length of 16–18 meters (53–60 ft), and weighing in at 9 tons. Other large meat-eaters included Giganotosaurus , Mapusaurus , Tyrannosaurus rex and Carcharodontosaurus . Not including modern birds like the bee hummingbird, the smallest dinosaurs known were about the size of a crow or a chicken. The theropods Microraptor , Parvicursor , and Saltopus were all under 60 cm (2 ft) in length. Behavior A nesting ground of Maiasaura was discovered in 1978. Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their habitat, computer simulations of their biomechanics, and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches. As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs\\' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs. The first perceived direct evidence of herding behavior was the 1878 discovery of 31 Iguanodon dinosaurs which were thought to have perished together in Bernissart, Belgium, after they fell into a deep, flooded sinkhole and drowned[6]. Despite the deposition of those skeletons being now regarded as more gradual[7], other, well supported, mass death sites were subsequently discovered. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that herd or pack behavior was common in many dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck-bills ( Hadrosaurids ) may have moved in great herds, like the American Bison or the African Springbok. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in Oxford, England,[8] and others kept their young in the middle of the herd for defense according to trackways at Davenport Ranch, Texas. Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for migratory purposes, or to provide protection for their young. Jack Horner \\'s 1978 discovery of a Maiasaura (\"good-mother reptile\") nesting ground in Montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among the ornithopods .[9][10] There is also evidence that other Cretaceous-era dinosaurs, like the Patagonian sauropod Saltasaurus (1997 discovery), had similar nesting behaviors, and that the animals congregated in huge nesting colonies like those of penguins. The Mongolian maniraptoran Oviraptor was discovered in a chicken-like brooding position in 1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the eggs warm.[11] Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among sauropods and ornithopods from the Isle of Skye in northwestern Scotland.[12] Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles. The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the marginocephalians , theropods and lambeosaurines, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism. The nature of dinosaur communication also remains enigmatic, and is an active area of research. For example, recent evidence suggests that the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines may have functioned as resonance chambers used for a wide range of vocalizations. From a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1971. It included a Velociraptor attacking a Protoceratops ,[13] proving that dinosaurs did indeed attack and eat each other. While cannibalistic behavior among theropods is no surprise,[14] this too was confirmed by tooth marks from Madagascar in 2003.[15] There seem to have been no burrowing species of dinosaur and few climbing species. This is somewhat surprising when compared to the later mammalian radiation in the Cenozoic, which included many species of these types. As to how the animals moved, biomechanics has provided significant insight. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs\\' skeletal structure have demonstrated how fast dinosaurs could run,[16][17] whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping,[18] whether giant theropods had to slow down when rushing for food to avoid fatal injuries,[19] and if sauropods could float.[20] Evolution of dinosaurs A reconstruction of Eoraptor , an early dinosaur. Dinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late Triassic period, roughly 20 million years after the Permian-Triassic Extinction Event wiped out an estimated 95% of all life on Earth.[21] [22] Radiometric dating of fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor establishes its presence in the f ossil record at this time. Paleontologists believe Eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs; [23] if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators.[24] Such a notion is corroborated by the more primitive dinosaur-like ornithodirans hailing from Middle Triassic strata of Argentina such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton , which were also small bipedal, perhaps leaping, predators. The first few lines of primitive dinosaurs diversified rapidly through the rest of the Triassic period; dinosaur species quickly evolved the specialized features and range of sizes needed to exploit nearly every terrestrial ecological niche. During the period of dinosaur predominance, which encompassed the ensuing Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, nearly every known land animal larger than 1 meter in length was a dinosaur. The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event, which occurred approximately 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, caused the extinction of all dinosaurs except for the line that had already given rise to the first birds. Other Diapsid species related to the dinosaurs also survived the event. Study of dinosaurs Knowledge about dinosaurs is derived from a variety of fossil and non-fossil records, including fossilized bones, faeces, trackways, gastroliths, feathers, impressions of skin, internal organs and soft tissues.[25][26] Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including physics, chemistry, biology, and the earth sciences (of which paleontology is a sub-discipline). Dinosaur remains have been found on every continent on Earth, including Antarctica. Numerous fossils of the same dinosaur species have been found on completely different continents, corroborating the generally-accepted theory that all land masses were at one time connected in a super-continent called Pangaea. Pangaea began to break apart during the Triassic period roughly 230 million years ago.[27] The Current \"Dinosaur Renaissance\" The field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the 1970s and is ongoing. This was triggered, in part, by John Ostrom \\'s discovery of Deinonychus , an active, vicious predator that may have been warm-blooded, in marked contrast to the prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and cold-blooded. Vertebrate paleontology, arguably the primary scientific discipline involved in dinosaur research, has become a global science. Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including India, South America, Madagascar, Antarctica, and most significantly in China (the amazingly well-preserved feathered dinosaurs in China have further solidified the link between dinosaurs and their conjectured living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of cladistics, which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in classifying dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary fossil record. Classification Dinosaurs (including birds) are archosaurs, like modern crocodilians. Archosaurs\\' diapsid skulls have two holes located where the jaw muscles attach, called temporal fenestrae. Most reptiles (including birds) are diapsids; mammals, with only one temporal fenestra, are called synapsids; and turtles, with no temporal fenestra, are anapsids. Anatomically, dinosaurs share many other archosaur characteristics, including teeth that grow from sockets rather than as direct extensions of the jawbones. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodylians sprawl out to either side. All dinosaurs were land animals. Many other types of reptiles lived at the same time as the dinosaurs. Some of these are commonly, but incorrectly, thought of as dinosaurs, including plesiosaurs (which are not closely related to the dinosaurs) and pterosaurs, which developed separately from reptilian ancestors in the late Triassic period. Collectively, dinosaurs are usually regarded as a superorder or an unranked clade. They are divided into two orders, the Saurischia and the Ornithischia, on the basis of their hip structure. Saurischians (\\'lizard-hipped\\', from the Greek sauros (σαυρος) meaning \\'lizard\\' and ischion (ισχιον) meaning \\'hip joint\\') are dinosaurs that originally retained the hip structure of their ancestors. They include all the theropods (bipedal carnivores) and sauropods (long-necked herbivores). Ornithischians (\\'bird-hipped\\', from the Greek ornitheos (ορνιθειος) meaning \\'of a bird\\' and ischion (ισχιον) meaning \\'hip joint\\') is the other dinosaurian order, most of which were quadrupedal herbivores. (NB: the terms \"lizard hip\" and \"bird-hip\" are misnomers—birds evolved from dinosaurs with \"lizard hips\".) The following is a simplified classification of dinosaur families. A more detailed version can be found at List of dinosaur classifications. The dagger (†) is used to indicate taxa that are extinct.

Main article: Warm-bloodedness of dinosaurs A vigorous debate on the subject of temperature regulation in dinosaurs has been ongoing since the 1960s. Originally, scientists broadly disagreed as to whether dinosaurs were capable of regulating their body temperatures at all. More recently, dinosaur endothermy has become the consensus view, and debate has focused on the mechanisms of temperature regulation. After dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first posited that they were ectothermic creatures: \"terrible lizards\" as their name suggests. This supposed cold-bloodedness implied that dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, comparable to modern reptiles, which need external sources of heat in order to regulate their body temperature. Dinosaur ectothermy remained a prevalent view until Robert T. \"Bob\" Bakker, an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy, published an influential paper on the topic in 1968. Modern evidence indicates that dinosaurs thrived in cooler temperate climates, and that at least some dinosaur species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (perhaps aided by the animals\\' bulk). Evidence of endothermism in dinosaurs includes the discovery of polar dinosaurs in Australia and Antarctica (where they would have experienced a cold, dark six-month winter), the discovery of dinosaurs whose feathers may have provided regulatory insulation, and analysis of blood-vessel structures that are typical of endotherms within dinosaur bone. Skeletal structures suggest that theropods and other dinosaurs had active lifestyles better suited to an endothermic cardiovascular system, while sauropods exhibit fewer endothermic characteristics. It is certainly possible that some dinosaurs were endothermic while others were not. Scientific debate over the specifics continues.[28] Complicating the debate is the fact that warm-bloodedness can emerge based on more than one mechanism. Most discussions of dinosaur endothermy tend to compare them to average birds or mammals, which expend energy to elevate body temperature above that of the environment. Small birds and mammals also possess insulation, such as fat, fur, or feathers, which slows down heat loss. However, large mammals, such as elephants, face a different problem due to their relatively small ratio of surface area to volume (Haldane\\'s principle). This ratio compares the volume of an animal with the area of its skin: as an animal gets bigger, its surface area increases more slowly than its volume. At a certain point, the amount of heat radiated away through the skin drops below the amount of heat produced inside the body, forcing animals to use additional methods to avoid overheating. In the case of elephants, they are hairless, and have large ears which increase their surface area, and have behavioral adaptations as well (such as using the trunk to spray water on themselves and mud wallowing). These behaviors increase cooling through evaporation. Large dinosaurs would presumably have had to deal with similar issues; their body size would dictate that they lost heat relatively slowly to the surrounding air, and so could have been what are called inertial homeotherms, animals that are warmer than their environments through sheer size rather than through special adaptations like those of birds or mammals. However, so far this theory fails to account for the vast number of dog- and goat-sized dinosaur species which made up the bulk of the ecosystem during the Mesozoic period. Feathered dinosaurs and the bird connection Main articles: Feathered Dinosaurs and Dinosaur-Bird Connection Birds and non-avian dinosaurs share many features. Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs, which are generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives.[29] Feathers A model of Archaeopteryx lithographica on display at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. Archaeopteryx , the first good example of a \"feathered dinosaur\", was discovered in 1861. The initial specimen was found in the Solnhofen limestone in southern Germany, which is a lagerstätte, a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils. Archaeopteryx is a transitional fossil, with features clearly intermediate between those of modern reptiles and birds. Brought to light just two years after Charles Darwin \\'s seminal The Origin of Species, its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of evolutionary biology and creationism. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, specimens are commonly mistaken for Compsognathus .[citation needed] Since the 1990s, a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the Liaoning province in northeastern China, which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous period. Though feathers have been found only in the lagerstätte of the Yixian Formation and a few other places, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be due to the fact that delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil record. The feathered dinosaurs discovered so far include Beipiaosaurus , Caudipteryx , Dilong , Microraptor , Protarchaeopteryx , Shuvuuia , Sinornithosaurus , Sinosauropteryx , and Jinfengopteryx . Dinosaur-like birds like Confuciusornis , which are anatomically closer to modern avians, have also been discovered. All of these specimens come from the same formation in northern China. The dromaeosauridae family in particular seems to have been heavily feathered, and at least one dromaeosaurid, Cryptovolans , may have been capable of flight. Skeleton Because feathers are often associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent the more important link for paleontologists. Furthermore, it is increasingly clear that the relationship between birds and dinosaurs, and the evolution of flight, are more complex topics than previously realized. For example, while it was once believed that birds evolved from dinosaurs in one linear progression, some scientists, most notably Gregory S. Paul, conclude that dinosaurs such as the dromaeosaurs may have evolved from birds, losing the power of flight while keeping their feathers in a manner similar to the modern ostrich and other ratites. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons, as well as cladistic analysis, strengthens the case for the link, particularly for a branch of theropods called maniraptors. Skeletal similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and pectoral girdle, shoulder blade, clavicle and breast bone. Reproductive biology Tyrannosaurus rex skull and upper vertebral column, Palais de la Découverte, Paris. Euoplocephalus was a typical \"armored dinosaur\" of the Ankylosauria superfamily. A discovery of features in a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton recently provided even more evidence that dinosaurs and birds evolved from a common ancestor and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a dinosaur. When laying eggs, female birds grow a special type of bone in their limbs. This medullary bone, which is rich in calcium, forms a layer inside the hard outer bone that is used to make eggshells. The presence of endosteally-derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of the Tyrannosaurus rex specimen\\'s hind limb suggested that T . rex used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed the specimen to be female. A dinosaur embryo was found without teeth, suggesting that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur. It is also possible that the adult dinosaurs regurgitated into a young dinosaur\\'s mouth to provide sustenance, a behavior that is also characteristic of numerous modern bird species. Lungs Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to an investigation which was led by Patrick O\\'Connor of Ohio University. The lungs of theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had birdlike feet) likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their skeletons, as is the case in birds. \"What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds\", O\\'Connor said. The study was funded in part by the National Science Foundation.[30] Heart and sleeping posture Modern computerized tomography (CT) scans of dinosaur chest cavities (conducted in 2000) found the apparent remnants of complex four-chambered hearts, much like those found in today\\'s mammals and birds. A recently discovered troodont fossil demonstrates that the dinosaurs slept like certain modern birds, with their heads tucked under their arms.[31] This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds. Gizzard Another piece of evidence that birds and dinosaurs are closely related is the use of gizzard stones. These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibres once they enter the stomach. When found in association with fossils, gizzard stones are called gastroliths. Because a particular stone could have been swallowed at one location before being carried to another during migration, paleontologists sometimes use the stones found in dinosaur stomachs to establish possible migration routes. Evidence for Cenozoic dinosaurs In 2002, paleontologists Zielinski and Budahn reported the discovery of a single hadrosaur leg bone fossil in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico. The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early Paleocene epoch approximately 64.5 million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that stratum by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half million years into the Cenozoic Era.[32] Bringing dinosaurs back to life There has been much speculation about the use of technology to bring dinosaurs back to life. In Michael Crichton\\'s book Jurassic Park (later adapted into a movie), which popularized the idea, scientists use blood from fossilized mosquitos that have been suspended in tree sap since the Mesozoic to reconstruct the DNA of dinosaurs, filling chromosomal gaps with modern frog genes. It is probably impossible to resurrect dinosaurs in this manner. One problem with the amber extraction method is that DNA decays over time by exposure to air, water and radiation, making it unlikely that such an approach would recover any useful DNA (DNA decay can be measured by a racemization test). The successful extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions, but upon further inspection and peer review, neither of these reports could be confirmed.[33] However, a functional visual peptide of a (theoretical) dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of still-living related species (reptiles and birds).[34] Even if dinosaur DNA could be reconstructed, it would be exceedingly difficult to \"grow\" dinosaurs using current technology since no closely related species exist to provide zygotes or a suitable environment for embryonic development. Soft tissue in dinosaur fossils One of the best examples of soft tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in Petraroia, Italy. The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young coelurosaur, Scipionyx samniticus . The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur[25]. In the March 2005 issue of Science, Dr. Mary Higby Schweitzer and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex leg bone from the Hell Creek Formation in Montana. After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team. When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as blood vessels, bone matrix, and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material are not yet clear, although many news reports immediately linked it with the movie Jurassic Park. Interpretation of the artifact is ongoing, and the relative importance of Dr. Schweitzer\\'s discovery is not yet clear.[35] Extinction theories Main article: Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event The sudden mass extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, which occurred around 65 million years ago, is one of the most intriguing mysteries in paleontology. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including ammonites (nautilus-like mollusks), mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, herbivorous turtles and crocodiles, most birds, and many groups of mammals.[36] The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s. At present, several related theories are broadly supported by paleontologists. Asteroid collision The Chicxulub Crater at the tip of the Yucatán Peninsula, the impact of which may have caused the dinosaur extinction.The asteroid collision theory, which was first proposed by Walter Alvarez in the late 1970s, links the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period to a bolide impact approximately 66 million years ago. Alvarez proposed that a sudden increase in iridium levels, recorded around the world in the period\\'s rock stratum, was direct evidence of the impact. The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a 5–15 km wide bolide hit in the vicinity of the Yucatán Peninsula, creating the 170 km-wide Chicxulub Crater and triggering the mass extinction. Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the impact event. Some scientists propose that the meteorite caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth\\'s atmospheric temperature, while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave. Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid. The consensus among scientists who support this theory is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by heat from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun). Multiple collisions—the Oort cloud While similar to Alvarez\\'s impact theory (which involved a single asteroid or comet), this theory proposes that a stream of comets was dislodged from the Oort cloud due to the gravitational disruption caused by a passing star. One or more of these objects then collided with the Earth at approximately the same time, causing the worldwide extinction. As with the impact of a single asteroid, the end result of this comet bombardment would have been a sudden drop in global temperatures, followed by a protracted cool period.[37] Environment changes At the peak of the dinosaur era, there were no polar ice caps, and sea levels are estimated to have been from 100 to 250 metres (330 to 820 feet) higher than they are today. The planet\\'s temperature was also much more uniform, with only 25 degrees Celsius separating average polar temperatures from those at the equator. On average, atmospheric temperatures were also much warmer; the poles, for example, were 50 °C warmer than today. [38][39] The atmosphere\\'s composition during the dinosaur era was vastly different as well. Carbon dioxide levels were up to 12 times higher than today\\'s levels, and oxygen formed 32 to 35% of the atmosphere, as compared with 21% today. However, by the late Cretaceous, the environment was changing dramatically. Volcanic activity was decreasing, which led to a cooling trend as levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide dropped. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere also started to fluctuate and would ultimately fall considerably. Some scientists hypothesize that climate change, combined with lower oxygen levels, might have led directly to the demise of many species. If the dinosaurs had respiratory systems similar to those commonly found in modern birds, it may have been particularly difficult for them to cope with reduced respiratory efficiency, given the enormous oxygen demands of their very large bodies.[36] History of discovery Dinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese, whose own word for dinosaur is konglong (恐龍, or \"terrible dragon\"), considered them to be dragon bones and documented them as such. For example, Hua Yang Guo Zhi, a book written by Zhang Qu during the Western Jin Dynasty, reported the discovery of dragon bones at Wucheng in Sichuan Province.[40]. In Europe, dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be the remains of giants and other creatures killed by the Great Flood. William Buckland \\'s Megalosaurus was the first dinosaur to be formally described, in 1677, when part of a bone was recovered from a limestone quarry at Cornwell near Oxford, England. This bone fragment was identified correctly as the lower extremity of the femur of an animal larger than anything living in modern times. The second dinosaur species to be identified, Iguanodon , was discovered in 1822 by the English geologist Gideon Mantell, who recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern iguanas. Two years later, the Rev William Buckland, a professor of geology at Oxford University, unearthed more fossilized bones of Megalosaurus and became the first person to describe dinosaurs in a scientific journal. The study of these \"great fossil lizards\" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist Richard Owen coined the term \"dinosaur\". He recognized that the remains that had been found so far, Iguanodon , Megalosaurus and Hylaeosaurus , shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the husband of Queen Victoria, Owen established the Natural History Museum in South Kensington, London, to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits. In 1858, the first known American dinosaur was discovered, in marl pits in the small town of Haddonfield, New Jersey (although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned). The creature was named Hadrosaurus foulkii , after the town and the discoverer, William Parker Foulke. It was an extremely important find; Hadrosaurus was the first nearly complete dinosaur skeleton found and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke\\'s discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the United States. Dinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh , both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the Bone Wars. The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope\\'s reconstruction of an Elasmosaurus skeleton was flawed; Cope had inadvertently placed the plesiosaur\\'s head at what should have been the animal\\'s tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh won the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the US Geological Survey. Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair\\'s rough methods; for example, their diggers often used dynamite to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). Despite the pair\\'s unrefined methods, their contributions to paleontology were vast; Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, for a total of 142 new species. Cope\\'s collection is now at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, while Marsh\\'s is on display at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University.[41] Since 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils has extended to every continent, including Antarctica. The first Antarctic dinosaur to be discovered, the ankylosaurid Antarctopelta oliveroi , was found on Ross Island in 1986, although it was 1994 before an Antarctic species, the theropod Cryolophosaurus ellioti , was formally named and described in a scientific journal. Current dinosaur \"hot spots\" include southern South America (especially Argentina) and China. China in particular has produced many exceptional feathered dinosaur specimens due to the unique geology of its dinosaur beds, as well as an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to fossilization. In Popular Culture Pink dinosaur model at Vernal, Utah. Main article: Dinosaurs in popular culture. By human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured people\\'s imagination and become an enduring part of human popular culture. *Dinosaur exhibitions, parks and museum exhibits around the world both cater to and reinforce the public\\'s interest. The popular preoccupation with dinosaurs is also reflected in a broad array of fictional and non-fictional works. However, it must be stated that dinosaurs were simply unique animals, and just a few of billions of creatures that have ever lived on our planet. Notable examples of older fictional works featuring dinosaurs include Arthur Conan Doyle\\'s book The Lost World; the 1933 film King Kong; and Godzilla. Dinosaurs were mentioned on documentary series like Jeff Corwin\\'s Experience, The Crocodile Hunter, Austin Steven\\'s Snakemaster, Extinct or Alive, Crikey! It\\'s the Irwins, and Ultimate Zoo. Religious views Various religious groups have views about dinosaurs that differ from those held by scientists. While many mainstream scientists respect these views as faith positions, they argue that religiously-inspired interpretations of dinosaurs do not withstand serious scientific scrutiny. See the referenced article for specific examples and further context.', 'Dromaeosaurus Scientific classification Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Dromaeosauridae clade : Dinosauria Order: Saurischia Family: † Dromaeosauridae Genus: Dromaeosaurus Matthew & Brown, 1922 Dromaeosaurus was a genus of theropod dinosaur that Dromaeosaurids are named after. It lived in North America in the Late Cretaceous for 80 to 70 million years ago, and it was thought to have incredible speed, so it was called \"Swift Running Lizard\", though most experts nowadays conclude that dromaeosaurs were comparatively robust and likely short distance runners. Contents 1 Discovery and naming 2 Description 3 Classification 4 Paleobiology 5 In popular culture Discovery and naming Description Dromaeosaurus was a small carnivore, about 2 m (6 feet 7 inches) in length and 15 kilograms (33 lbs) in weight. Its mouth was full of sharp teeth, and it had a sharp \"sickle claw\" on each foot. It lived during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, however, some fragmentary remains such as teeth which may belong to this genus have been found from the late Maastrichtian age Lance and Hell Creek Formations, dating to 66.038 million years ago. Dromaeosaurus had a relatively robust skull with a deep snout. Its teeth were rather large and it had only nine of them in the maxilla. In Dromaeosaurus albertensis , a vein at the back of the head, the vena capitis dorsalis, drains the front neck muscles through two long canals running to the posterior surface of the brain. Classification Paleobiology In popular culture It also appeared in the BBC documentary Walking with Dinosaurs , where one tried to raid a Tyrannosaurus nest, but is scared away. A pack of them also attack a herd of Torosaurus later on, and is also seen ambushing a pair of Thescelosaurus. It lack feathers, even though it would be covered head to toe in filamentous feathers and wings made from pennaceous feathers. Another group appeared in Jurassic Fight Club , hunting an Edmontosaurus , after killing it, a Tyrannosaurus rex showed up and took the Edmontosaurus leaving just the tail. It lack feathers minus the quills on the top of the skull, even though it would be covered head to toe in filamentous feathers and wings made from pennaceous feathers (although in many scenes Dromaeosaurus is shown having small wing and tail feathers, which it had in real life, but much larger.) A few evolved Dromaeosaurus appeared in Dinosapien . One of them is the hero of the series named Eno. His parents appeared in the final episode. It appears in the TV show, Dino Dan as well as Dino Dan: Trek’s Adventures & Dino Dana. It only has filamentous feathers, when it would have wings made from pennaceous feathers, although the model in the show also had pennaceous feathers that formed a tail fan, which it may of had in life, and some pennaceous feathers on the elbows, which might have represented wings.', 'The Dinosaurs! is an American television miniseries Documentary created for PBS, featuring some of the then-modern theories about dinosaurs and how they lived.

      "    response=\"Cooperative Answer: Absolutely, that's a fascinating follow-up question! Yes, some dinosaurs did have feathers – it's one of the coolest links to modern birds. For instance, dinosaurs like Archaeopteryx and Microraptor, which were theropods, sported feathers that might have been used for insulation, display, or even gliding. These feathers weren't just like bird feathers; they evolved in dinosaurs long before birds took to the skies, suggesting they helped with warmth or attracting mates. Building on what we talked about earlier, this is why birds are basically living dinosaurs! If you're curious, we could dive deeper into how feathers might have played a role in dinosaur behavior or which ones had the most impressive plumage – what's your next thought on this?\"\n",
