    "Why we chose to enrich the model with the intermediary fields “student_goal” and “pragmatic_need”:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Capture the core idea: Cooperative answers rely on Theory of Mind (ToM) elements—understanding the user’s goals, intent, and needs. These fields allow the model to explicitly represent and reason about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Cost efficiency: If we instead generated “cooperative” questions and re-queried the context, the number of LLM calls and input tokens would increase significantly, raising costs. By focusing directly on the core idea, we can anticipate such questions more efficiently."

(at the time of physical death) Relationships unknown Occupation Groundskeeper (when he was alive) Child Molester (when he was alive) Serial Killer (confirmed after death, not stated either way when he was alive) Appearances 2010 reboot Portrayal Jackie Earle Haley This version of Freddy Krueger is the main antagonist of the A Nightmare on Elm Street Reboot . In this film, Freddy appeared once again as a Dream Demon and a serial killer after his death. In life, he was a child molester. It isn\\'t stated in the film whether or not he\\'d killed anybody when he was alive. After death, he killed the majority of the teenage children who he blames for his death in their nightmares, but Nancy Holbrook and Quentin Smith survived. Unlike the original Freddy Krueger , who, over the course of the series, developed a cheeky and dark humored personality and always cracked puns and jokes when he killed his victims, the reboot version of Freddy seemed to be more in line with how Wes Craven had originally envisioned the character; a much more serious killer.

Freddy initially appeared to have been wrongly accused and seemingly looked like a friendly gardener around the children. The parents, after they heard about the abuse from their children and observed slashes on their skin and clothes that were consistent with his trademark glove , chased Freddy down to a building, in which Freddy locked himself in. One of the parents threw in a container of gasoline with a burning rag. It is implied that he did this to force him to come out, not to intentionally burn him to death. However, he did end up burning him to death. The parents did that to spare their children the trauma of having to testify against him in open court. Having been burned to death, Freddy somehow returned as a vengeful Dream Demon who killed off the teenage children in their dreams one by one as payback against the parents for killing him and/or as payback against them for reporting his actions to their parents. During the climax, Nancy pulled Freddy into the physical world and apparently killed him by severing his gloved-hand and slashed his throat with a broken paper cutter blade. However, Freddy was shown to still be alive and he killed Nancy\\'s mother, Gwen Holbrook, from the mirror reflection. (ENTP) Characterization Powers and abilities Weaknesses Appearance The reboot Freddy\\'s clothing looked almost identical to that of both the Freddy Krueger of the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series and the Freddy Krueger of Freddy\\'s Nightmares; he wore the same red and green sweater and hat as well as sported the iconic glove that he used to kill his victims. The biggest difference were his burns, while the previous Freddy Kruegers did indeed look burnt the remake\\'s Freddy\\'s burns looked much more realistic and made Freddy realistically look like a person who had been horribly burnt. This Freddy also had a noticeable hole in his left cheek as well as one milky cloudy eye and one red blood shot eye. Along with those, this version of Freddy Krueger looked more gaunt and thinner than the previous Freddy Kruegers.

Jackie Earle Haley , who played Freddy, originally auditioned for the role of Glen Lantz in the original Elm Street , but lost to his friend, Johnny Depp . Haley went on and portrayed Freddy in the remake 26 years later. The remake Freddy being a child molester was something that Wes Craven had wanted the original Freddy to be in the first Nightmare film, but it being straight out stated was dropped in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time. However, it is strongly implied at times in the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series. It is, however, straight out stated in Freddy\\'s Nightmares: A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Series , which is a different story than any of the movies, in the episode \" It\\'s My Party and You\\'ll Die If I Want You To \". This version of Freddy makes an appearance as a DLC Character for the reboot and ninth entry of the fighting game series, Mortal Kombat . Despite his resemblance to the 2010 remake\\'s version of Freddy though, he is voiced by Patrick Seitz imitating Robert Englund\\'s voice as the character. This version of Freddy was added as DLC killer for the online survival horror game Dead By Daylight in 2017, along with Quentin Smith as a playable survivor. He is the third killer from a licensed property to be featured in the game, as fellow slasher villains Michael Myers of the Halloween film series and Leatherface of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre film series were added to the game prior to his inclusion. This was the only Freddy Krueger portrayal to have his scars and burned appearance to be completely CGI rather than practical makeup affects.', \"Mr. Underwood General information Age ?

He presumably took in Freddy at a young age when Freddy's biological mother gave him up for adoption. He is Freddy's First Murder Victim. He was portrayed by singer-songwriter, Alice Cooper . His equivalent in the comic Freddy Krueger's A Nightmare on Elm Street is Walter Fingle . Biography A severe alcoholic, Mr. Underwood abused Freddy both verbally and physically. His preferred method of beating Freddy was apparently whipping with a belt. Once he became a teenager, Freddy, fed up with his foster father's abuse, murdered Mr. Underwood when he came home drunk one day, and laughed off his blows before he stabbed him in the eye with a straight razor as revenge, a memory which Freddy's daughter, Maggie Burroughs , later witnessed after she entered Freddy's mind years later in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare .\", \"Little Girl General information Age 12 (at the time of her death) Relationships unknown Occupation One of Freddy Krueger's pre-death victims Appearances Freddy vs. Jason Portrayal Joelle Antonissen This article is about a character credited simply as Little Girl in the closing credits of Freddy vs. Jason .

She is also one of the 20 Child Victims of the Springwood Slasher. This unidentified young girl was a resident of the town of Springwood , Ohio. In the 1960s, she became a target of a child murderer named Freddy Krueger. Freddy abducted the little girl and brought her back to the Boiler Room of the Power Plant where he worked. He took the doll the girl was cluching and threw it into a burner. He then sharpened the knives he was going to use in front of her and then stood up straight and approached her as she backed against a wall. Soon after, her life ended. It is possible that this little girl might be one of the ghosts always seen playing jump-rope or hopscotch in the vicinity of the Elm Street House . Lori Campbell had a nightmare in a police station wherein she saw this little girl with no eyes and verticle slashes across her eye sockets. The girl told her that Freddy was coming back.

He welcomed a return to immortality.

Trivia If not counting the DC characters, Freddy is the second guest character to appear in the Mortal Kombat series, the first being Kratos . However, he is the first DLC character originated from movies. Unlike Kratos, Freddy is available for both consoles. However, also unlike Kratos, he does not have his own arena. In the movies, Freddy only had claws on his right hand. In this game, however, he has claws on both hands for gameplay mechanics. This marks the first time Freddy is seen using two claws on his hands instead of just one. His first Fatality is based on the way he killed Glen Lantz in the original Nightmare on Elm Street , while his second Fatality is based on the way he killed Kristen Parker in the 4th Nightmare on Elm Street. His X-Ray Move is based on the way he killed Taryn White in the 3rd Nightmare on Elm Street . The names of his first fatality and his X-Ray are lines spoken to two of his victims before he killed them, the first to Ronald Kincaid in response to his comment \"I\\'ll see you in hell\", the second to Taryn White, a former junkie. Much like Shang Tsung , Freddy Krueger feeds off the souls of his victims. Much like Kabal , Freddy\\'s disfigured appearance is the result of being burned alive. Much like how Smoke can dash forward and backwards while turned into a cloud of smoke, Freddy can also move away and forward in a unique way, with his Dream Shift special move. Krueger and Scorpion were both aged 32 before they died and became immortals. They also share a similar power of hellfire. Ed Boon has stated there\\'s a future possibility of more DLC, but it\\'s uncertain at this time. Amongst with Reptile , Kano , Baraka , the bosses and the rest of the DLC characters, Krueger has no battle cry. Freddy Krueger, along with Kintaro , Kratos, Reptile, Shang Tsung, Shao Kahn , Skarlet , and Johnny Cage are the only characters in MK 2011 who do not cry during their Babalities . He is the only character in MK 2011 to have a Fatality that involves the victim only losing one arm. Also, his Tell\\'em Freddy Sent Ya fatality is the only Fatality that can be performed anywhere in the stage. The woman Freddy kills in at the end of his ladder ending bears an extremely strong resemblance to Nancy Thompson on the original poster advertising the first A Nightmare on Elm Street . Nancy Thompson being the woman who originally defeats Freddy at the end of the first film, but is killed in the 3rd film. Like Kratos, Freddy performs a sweep with his clawed gloves instead of his leg. The game uses the body model of JEH\\'s Freddy. However Robert Englund reprises the role once again, making this version of Freddy the only one to be a hybrid of two different versions of Krueger. This also makes Robert Englund the only Freddy actor to have portrayed two different versions of Freddy Krueger, as well as the first time he has voiced Freddy in a video game. For many years since the Freddy DLC was released many Mortal Kombat and Nightmare fans assumed that Patrick Seitz, the voice actor of Scorpion, had lent his talents to voicing the Dream Demon and imitated the vocal style of Robert Englund to sound as close to Freddy as possible. However Ed Boon, one of the creators of the Mortal Kombat series revealed in 2017 that they had in fact gotten to work with Robert Englund for the Freddy DLC, meaning it had been Englund who had voiced Freddy in the fighting game the whole time. Even Patrick Seitz confirmed Ed Boon\\'s statement, as he had many times in the past told fans who asked him that he hadn\\'t voiced Freddy, and didn\\'t even know where the assumption of him doing the voice had come from. Freddy is the first guest character from a film franchise to appear in the Mortal Kombat series. Freddy\\'s appearance as a playable guest character would mark the beginning of several guest characters from horror films making playable appearances in the Mortal Kombat series. Mortal Kombat X features Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th , and Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . He is also the only film guest fighter to have his original actor reprise his voice. Aside from a \"Shhh.\" while performing his throw and a \"No!\" after being thrown in front of a car during The Streetstage fatality, Freddy does not speak during the game. He is only heard laughing in his intro and some of his fatalities, and he also grunts or yells in pain when attacked. All of these effects are voiced by Robert Englund, which was not confirmed until 2017 by Ed Boon on Twitter. Freddy only had claws on his right hand in every appearance of the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. In Mortal Kombat however, he has claws on both hands for gameplay mechanics. Additionally, his bio has stated that he needs two claws in order to defeat Shao Kahn. The majority of the moves in Freddy\\'s move list are named after lines he has said, and a handful are inspired by methods he used to kill his victims in the A Nightmare on Elm Street films. Tell \\'Em Freddy Sent Ya , his first Fatality, is based on the way he killed Glen Lantz in the original Nightmare on Elm Street . The move\\'s name is actually Freddy\\'s response to another victim, Roland Kincaid: the teenager told Freddy, \"I\\'ll see you in hell\", before he was killed. The blood that spews out of the ground is likely a reference to Glenn\\'s death in the same film, as the same thing happened when he was absorbed into his bed. What a Rush , his X-Ray Move, is named after a line he said to Taryn White before he killed her in the 3rd Nightmare on Elm Street . The move itself is based on how he killed her. Krueger\\'s Freddy Fingers , Hell Spike and Glove Toss moves are the same techniques used to kill Terry Fenstein, John Doe and Rick Johnson respectively in the A Nightmare on Elm Street films. Welcome to My Nightmare , his second Fatality, is based on the way he killed Kristen Parker in the 4th Nightmare on Elm Street . The move\\'s name comes from a line he said to Jason Voorhees, in the film Freddy vs. Jason . Power Glove Toss , the enhanced version of Glove Toss , is likely a reference in name to the Nintendo Power Glove, a gaming peripheral that Freddy used during the killing of Spencer Lewis. His Tell \\'Em Freddy Sent Ya Fatality is the only Fatality that can be performed anywhere in the stage. The woman Freddy kills in the end of his ladder ending bears a strong resemblance to Nancy Thompson from the first A Nightmare on Elm Street. This scene itself is a reference to the main promotional artwork of the film, which features Nancy in bed, awake with terror in her eyes while a transparent Freddy and his clawed glove can be seen above her . Freddy is the only character who can actually dodge Shao Kahn\\'s Hammer Throw move without teleporting or simply jumping, with the help of the Nightmare Stance . In a technical sense, he is the only reoccurring guest character in the Mortal Kombat games, appearing in Mortal Kombat (2011) and the mobile version of Mortal Kombat X . Freddy\\'s appearance in the mobile game is very different than his in-game appearance, appearing more like he did in the movies including only one razor glove. He is one of two characters in the mobile version of Mortal Kombat X with a revamped X-Ray attack as compared to their previous appearances. The second being Shao Kahn. In the game, Freddy will slash his opponent into the air and stabbing them in the chest with his glove, but will punch the opponent in the face, breaking their jaw before slashing them in the face shattering their entire skull. In Mortal Kombat Mobile, \"Nightmare\" Freddy Krueger can be upgraded from a Gold Card to a Diamond Card. He is the first mobile-exclusive character in Mortal Kombat X Mobile. In his original challenge, the player would receive a Cyber Armor after beating Hard Mode instead of Freddy\\'s Glove. This was changed in Update 1.11.1.', \"This is about the Freddy Krueger's Glove of A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010 film). If you are looking for one or more other versions of Freddy Krueger's Glove, please check the Freddy Krueger's Glove Disambiguation . Freddy Krueger's Glove is the main weapon of Freddy Krueger . It is based on the ninja weapon neko te. He apparently made it himself, before he was burned to death, in his room in the basement of Badham Preschool . The less said about what he apparently made it for, the better. He isn't actually shown making it. But in the deleted scenes, he is. Description It was redesigned. It was a hybrid of the Original Glove and the New Nightmare Hand, it only missed the blade on the thumb and was not as organic looking as the New Nightmare Hand. It features a cuff near the bottom of the glove and also instead of a backplate, long metal strips connected the finger plates to the cuffs.\"],\n",

      "    context=['Rex Reason ( 1928 - 2015 ) was an American actor. He was the brother of actor Rhodes Reason, who is two years younger. The two bore a strong resemblance and many may have mistakenly assumed they were twins. Reason was born in Berlin, Germany, but reared in Los Angeles and attended Hoover High School in Glendale, California. He enlisted in the United States Army at the age of seventeen. He began his stage career in 1948 at the Pasadena Playhouse, performing there for three years before coming to the notice of Hollywood. In 1951 he was given a screen test at Columbia Pictures and was cast as the lead in a starring role in his first picture, a low-budget adventure drama Storm Over Tibet (1952). Reason was under contract for two more years at Columbia until moving to Universal in mid-1953, after making a promising appearance in the sword-and-sandal epic Salome (1953) with Rita Hayworth. A tall (6\\'2\"), handsome, leading man with a distinctive baritone speaking voice, Reason appeared in several films and television shows throughout the 1950s and 1960s. He made two pictures at Universal Studios under the name \"Bart Roberts\" before demanding to be able to use his own name. Reason is perhaps best known for his role as stalwart, heroic scientist Dr. Cal Meacham in the science fiction This Island Earth (1955, which was later taken on by MST3K in their theatrical film installment). Reason then co-starred as sympathetic scientist Dr. Tom Morgan in Universal International Pictures \\' Creature from the Black Lagoon horror film series third and final installment The Creature Walks Among Us (1956). He also appeared opposite Clark Gable and Sidney Poitier in Band of Angels (WB, 1957). He appeared in Badlands of Montana (1957) as an opponent of a corrupt Mayor played by John M. Pickard. In the story line, Pickard administers ten lashes with a whip to Reason\\'s back. Reason starred as newspapermen in two television series. The first of those was a syndicated western Man Without a Gun (1957-59) in the role of Adam MacLean, editor of the Yellowstone Sentinel newspaper in Dakota Territory. The second was the ABC/Warner Bros. drama The Roaring Twenties (1960-62) which was a crime drama rich in period music. He played Scott Norris, reporter for the fictitious New York Record. Reason walked out on his film contract with Warner Bros. in the fall of 1961 when he was being considered for a starring role in John Frankenheimer\\'s The Manchurian Candidate . The film began as a Warner Bros. project, but was completed as an independent film and released by United Artists in 1962. The role he was going to play went to Laurence Harvey instead. After his film and television acting career ended, he worked as a real estate broker and had a second career as a voiceover actor. Following his retirement, Reason lived in Walnut, California, with his third wife, Shirley. In 1996, he appeared as a guest at the ConventioCon ExpoFest-A-Rama 2: Electric Boogaloo . Reason passed away in 2015.

He is considered one of Hollywood \\'s most venerated directors and producers. Contents 1 Biography 2 Innovations 3 Filmography 4 In-universe 4.1 Biography 4.2 Appearances 4.3 Sources 5 Notes and references Biography George Walton Lucas Jr. was born in Modesto, California. His father, George Walton Lucas, Sr., ran a stationery store and owned a small walnut orchard and was mainly of British and Swiss heritage. His mother, Dorothy Ellinore Bomberger Lucas, was a member of a prominent Modesto family (one of her cousins is the mother of former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman) and was mainly of German and Scots-Irish heritage. She was in poor health and often bedridden throughout Lucas\\' childhood. Lucas himself was short and scrawny as a child; his younger sister reportedly fought with other kids who picked on him. Lucas attended Thomas Downey High School, where he was an indifferent student at best and dreamed of becoming a professional race car driver. That early dream ended June 12, 1962, when he crashed his Fiat Bianchina. The car was clipped from behind while he tried to make a left turn into his driveway. The car rolled; the racing harness that he had installed snapped, and he was thrown from the car. Had the harness not snapped—and Lucas has said it shouldn\\'t have—he would most likely have been crushed to death by the steering column when the car smashed into a walnut tree. (The force of the impact uprooted the tree). During his recovery, Lucas reevaluated his life and decided to go to college. He enrolled at Modesto Junior College, where he earned an AA degree, then transferred to the University of Southern California\\'s School of Cinema-Television. USC was one of the earliest universities to have a school devoted to film studies. There he made a number of short films, including an early version of THX 1138 (the complete title was \"Electronic Labyrinth THX 1138 4EB\"), which later became his first full-length feature film. After graduating with a bachelor of fine arts in film in 1966, he drifted a little, trying to figure out what to do next. He tried joining the Air Force as an officer, but was turned down because of his numerous speeding tickets. He was later drafted by the Army, but tests showed he had diabetes, which killed his paternal grandfather. Lucas was prescribed medication for the disease and does not seem to have required insulin. In 1967, Lucas re-enrolled as a USC graduate student in film production. Eventually he co-founded the studio American Zoetrope with Francis Ford Coppola, hoping to create a liberating environment for filmmakers to direct outside the perceived oppressive control of the Hollywood studio system. From the financial success of his films American Graffiti (1973) and Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977), Lucas was able to set up his own studio, Lucasfilm , in Marin County in his native northern California. Skywalker Sound and Industrial Light and Magic, the sound and visual effects subdivisions of Lucasfilm, respectively, have become among the most respected firms in their fields. Lucasfilm Games, later renamed to LucasArts , is highly regarded in the gaming industry. Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope is considered by some to be the first \"high concept\" film, although others feel the first was Steven Spielberg\\'s Jaws, released two years prior. Lucas and Spielberg had been acquaintances for some time and eventually worked together on several films, notably the first Indiana Jones vehicle, Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981. On a return on investment basis, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope proved to be one of the most successful films of all time. During the filming of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Lucas waived his up front fee as director and negotiated to own the licensing rights—rights which the studio thought were nearly worthless. This decision earned him hundreds of millions of dollars as he was able to directly profit from all the licensed games, toys and collectibles created for the franchise. In 2004 Forbes Magazine estimated Lucas\\' personal wealth at $3 billion. In 2005 Forbes.com estimated the lifetime revenue generated by the Star Wars franchise at nearly $20 billion. Lucas was fined by the Directors Guild of America for refusing to have a standard title sequence in his Star Wars films. After paying the fine, he quit the guild. This made it hard for him to find a director for some of his later projects. According to some, he wanted his friend Spielberg to direct some of the later Star Wars movies, but as a member of the guild Spielberg may have been unable to do so. Spielberg has repeatedly stated that Lucas consciously did not let him direct any Star Wars films, despite the fact that Spielberg wanted to. Other directors Lucas pursued to aid him were David Lynch and David Cronenberg, both of whom declined. On October 3, 1994, Lucas started to write the three Star Wars prequels, and on November 1 that year, he left the day-to-day operations of his filmmaking business and started a sabbatical to finish the prequels. The American Film Institute awarded Lucas its Lifetime Achievement Award for 2005. He received the award on June 9, 2005. On June 5, 2005, Lucas was named 100th \"Greatest American\" by the Discovery Channel. Lucas married film editor Marcia Lou Griffin, who won an Oscar for her work on the original (fourth) Star Wars film, in 1969; they adopted a daughter, Amanda (b. 1981), and divorced in 1983. Lucas later adopted two more children: Katie (b. 1988), and Jett (b. 1993). All three children appeared in the prequel trilogy. Following Lucas\\' marriage to Mellody Hobson, he has fathered a fourth child, daughter Everest (b. 2013). In 2005, Lucas gave $1 million to help build a memorial in Washington D.C. for American civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In 2012, Lucas retired from making movies after selling Lucasfilm Ltd. to The Walt Disney Company for $4.5 billion. Innovations Besides his directorial and production work on movies, Lucas is the most significant contemporary contributor to modern movie technology. In 1975 Lucas established Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) in Van Nuys, CA, which was responsible for the invention of the special computer assisted camera crane \"Dykstraflex\" (named after special effects innovator, John Dykstra) that was used for most of the space fight sequences used in the Star Wars movies (technology which was later adopted by most other visual effects production units, such as those responsible for Battlestar Galactica and Star Trek: The Next Generation). Through ILM, Lucas spurred the further development of computer graphics, film laser scanners and the earliest use of 3D computer character animation in a film, Young Sherlock Holmes (co-produced by Spielberg). Lucas sold his early computer development unit to Steve Jobs in 1986, which was renamed Pixar. Lucas is also responsible for the modern sound systems found in many movie theaters. Though Lucas didn\\'t invent THX, he is responsible for its development. The acronym ostensibly stands for \"Tomlinson Holman eXperiment\" after its chief engineer, however, it is obviously a reference to Lucas\\' first film. Now Lucas is spearheading digital photography for movies. Though personal digital photography is now mainstream, most movie studios still use traditional cameras and film for movie production. Lucas departed from this model by filming Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones almost completely digitally prior to Austin, TX-based filmmaker Robert Rodriguez doing the same for 2003\\'s Once Upon a Time in Mexico . He showed the result to a select audience of the Hollywood elite, before the movie\\'s general release. For the presentation, Lucas used a special digital projection system. The attendees said the movie had the clearest and sharpest presentation they had ever seen. Despite the successful demonstration of the technology, movie studios are slow to move to this new model, in part because of the high price of the digital equipment.

Francis ( 1919 - 1973 ) was an American film director who has become known in recent years for the abysmal production quality of his three self-produced 1960s films. His trademark style included murky black & white scenes with poor acting, usually in desert locations, a preoccupation with light aircraft and parachuting, and coffee serving as a prop or a center of conversation. The plot often wandered inexplicably, to the point that some critics have suggested it represented an intentional artistic style. Francis was born in Oklahoma in 1919. Sometime around the Great Depression, he moved to Texas, then in the 1940s headed for the bright lights of Hollywood. He worked on several films during the late 1940s and 1950s without credit: Blondie\\'s Reward , Scarlet Angel , The Girl in White , This Island Earth , She Couldn\\'t Say No , Twilight for the Gods , and P.J. . His first break came in 1958 in a credited role in Stakeout on Dope Street , where he played a detective. He went on to play minor parts in dozens of other films. In 1961 he began writing, producing, and directing films with the help of pal Tony Cardoza , a welder by trade. Francis started with The Beast of Yucca Flats . He went on to direct, write, and produce two other movies, The Skydivers and Red Zone Cuba ( Night Train to Mundo Fine ). He appeared in Russ Meyer\\'s 1965 film Motor Psycho , and his last work in the film industry was in 1970, when he played a drunk in Meyer\\'s Beyond the Valley of the Dolls . Francis was overweight (around 350lbs) and developed health problems. He died in California in 1973. Though arteriosclerosis is listed as the cause, Cardoza says his body was found in the back of a station wagon at the Vine Street Ranch Market with \"a plastic bag over his head and a tube going into his mouth or around his throat.\" He is interred at the Columbarium of Remembrance in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. Instead of fading into the annals of cinematographic history, his films gained cult status in 1994 after being featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000 .

Francis ( 1919 - 1973 ) was an American film director who has become known in recent years for the abysmal production quality of his three self-produced 1960s films. His trademark style included murky black & white scenes with poor acting, usually in desert locations, a preoccupation with light aircraft and parachuting, and coffee serving as a prop or a center of conversation. The plot often wandered inexplicably, to the point that some critics have suggested it represented an intentional artistic style. Francis was born in Oklahoma in 1919. Sometime around the Great Depression, he moved to Texas, then in the 1940s headed for the bright lights of Hollywood. He worked on several films during the late 1940s and 1950s without credit: Blondie\\'s Reward , Scarlet Angel , The Girl in White , This Island Earth , She Couldn\\'t Say No , Twilight for the Gods , and P.J. . His first break came in 1958 in a credited role in Stakeout on Dope Street , where he played a detective. He went on to play minor parts in dozens of other films. In 1961 he began writing, producing, and directing films with the help of pal Tony Cardoza , a welder by trade. Francis started with The Beast of Yucca Flats . He went on to direct, write, and produce two other movies, The Skydivers and Red Zone Cuba ( Night Train to Mundo Fine ). He appeared in Russ Meyer\\'s 1965 film Motor Psycho , and his last work in the film industry was in 1970, when he played a drunk in Meyer\\'s Beyond the Valley of the Dolls . Francis was overweight (around 350lbs) and developed health problems. He died in California in 1973. Though arteriosclerosis is listed as the cause, Cardoza says his body was found in the back of a station wagon at the Vine Street Ranch Market with \"a plastic bag over his head and a tube going into his mouth or around his throat.\" He is interred at the Columbarium of Remembrance in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

      "    cooperative_answer='Yes, Batman comics and movies share many core similarities, but there are also notable differences in how storylines, characters, and themes are adapted, which can affect how faithfully the essence of the comics is captured. For instance, both mediums feature Batman\\'s origin as Bruce Wayne, his fight against villains like the Joker and Two-Face, and themes of justice, vigilantism, and moral ambiguity. Comics like Frank Miller\\'s \"The Dark Knight\" have directly influenced movies, such as Christopher Nolan\\'s trilogy (e.g., \"The Dark Knight Rises\" borrows elements like Batman\\'s retirement and return, as well as his confrontations with foes). However, movies often simplify complex comic storylines for runtime and audience appeal, resulting in a more action-oriented or visually spectacular take—Nolan\\'s films emphasize realism and psychological depth, while earlier ones like Tim Burton\\'s are more gothic and stylized. Comics tend to explore darker, more introspective themes and multiple timelines, which might not translate perfectly to films due to budget or rating constraints.\\n\\nTo help you decide if the movies capture the comics\\' essence, consider starting with Nolan\\'s trilogy if you want a closer adaptation of the gritty comic style, or the 1989 \"Batman\" for a fun, visual contrast. If you\\'re looking at accuracy, comics like \"The Dark Knight Returns\" offer a raw, dystopian edge that films sometimes tone down. Would you like recommendations on specific comics to compare with a movie, or details on how a particular character evolves across media? This can guide your enjoyment or discussions further.',\n",

The Flash Andy Muschietti will direct a Flash movie centering on Ezra Miller that will introduce the concept of a cinematic \"Multiverse.\" A retcon that would unite previous incarnations of the Batman film franchise. Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck will return as their versions of the character. Producer Barbara Muschietti promised that film would \"change everything, but doesn\\'t forget anything\" at the DC FanDome .

Contents 1 Sypnosis 2 Issues 3 Publication history 4 Influence 4.1 Comics 4.2 Film 4.3 Animation 4.4 Television 4.5 Video Games Sypnosis The Dark Knight is set in a dystopian near-future version of Gotham City . The year is never specified, though it has been a full decade since the last reported sighting of Batman. Society has lost faith in the functioning of justice, and the current American President, named only Dickard , and whose appearance seems to be a reference to Ronald Reagan, constantly tries to keep the social order with optimistic discourses, while the Cold War is still ongoing. Virtually all superheroes, with the exception of Superman , have been forced by governmental authorities into retirement or otherwise driven away by a distrusting populace. Bruce Wayne has voluntarily retired from crime fighting following the death (under unspecified circumstances) of Jason Todd , the second Robin . In the absence of superheroes, criminals run amok, and a gang called the Mutants terrorize Gotham City. The return of an old enemy prompts a now 55-year-old Wayne to don the Batman costume once again. Despite Wayne\\'s funding his rehabilitation, including plastic surgery to restore his half-disfigured face, Harvey \" Two-Face \" Dent has seemingly returned to crime. Batman apprehends Dent, but the populace debates whether Batman\\'s brand of vigilantism has any place in society. The media plays a large role in DKR , with the narrative broken up by news reports and \"talking head\" editorials debating events in the story as they unfold. After Batman saves her from a Mutant attack, 13-year-old Carrie Kelly buys herself a knock-off Robin costume, and searches for Batman to aid him. She finds Batman at the city dump, where he is fighting the Mutants. The Mutants\\' leader defeats Batman in combat, but Kelly distracts him and pulls Batman into the tank-like Batmobile . Kelly attends to Batman’s wounds as the vehicle drives toward the Batcave . Once home, Batman takes Carrie on as the new Robin despite his butler Alfred\\'s objections. With the help of retiring Commissioner James Gordon , the Mutants\\' leader is allowed to escape from jail, and Batman beats him in a mud fight in front of the assembled gang, which then disbands as a result of his humiliation. Some former Mutants create a new gang, the \"Sons of the Batman,\" using extremely violent methods (up to and including murder) to \"purge\" Gotham of its criminal element in what they see as emulation of Batman\\'s actions. Meanwhile, the return of Batman has caused one of his oldest and deadliest foes, The Joker , to awaken from a years-long catatonic state at Arkham Asylum . The Joker convinces his psychiatrist, Dr. Bartholomew Wolper, that he is sane and regrets his misdeeds. Seeking to discredit Batman, whom he has crusaded against in the media, Wolper appears with the Joker on a late-night show. While the police, now led by the anti-vigilante Commissioner Ellen Yindel , attack Batman, the Joker murders everyone in the television studio (including Wolper) and escapes. Batman and Robin track the Joker to a county fair, where Batman defeats Joker in a violent showdown. Batman stops short of killing the Joker; however, the Joker finishes the job himself, twisting his own broken neck, with the intent that the police will charge Batman with murder. Batman escapes, but not before another confrontation with the Gotham police, and a citywide manhunt is now on for the Caped Crusader. After Superman diverts a Russian nuclear warhead which then detonates in a desert, millions of tons of dust and debris fill the atmosphere, and Gotham descends into chaos during the resulting blackout. Batman and Robin train former Mutants and the brutal Sons of the Batman in non-lethal fighting to stop looting and ensure the flow of needed supplies. In the midst of nuclear winter conditions, Gotham becomes the safest city in America; the U.S. government, seeing this as a credibility-undermining embarrassment, orders Superman to take Batman down. Having been warned of the government\\'s plans by Oliver Queen, the former Green Arrow, Batman confronts Superman. Symbolically, their duel takes place in Crime Alley , where Bruce Wayne\\'s parents were murdered decades earlier. Batman defeats Superman in a well planned fight, but dies from a heart attack immediately afterward. After his funeral, it is revealed that his death was staged as an elaborate ruse; Clark Kent attends the funeral and gives Robin a knowing wink after hearing Bruce\\'s heartbeat as he leaves the grave site, suggesting his silent approval of what will happen next. Alfred destroys the Batcave and Wayne Manor and suffers a fatal stroke. Some time afterward, Batman leads Robin, Green Arrow, and the rest of his followers into the caverns beyond the Batcave and prepares to continue his fight. His plan, which will take years of training and studying, is to build an army, and to bring sense to a world plagued by something \"worse than thieves and murderers\". He decides that this will be a good life — good enough. Issues The Dark Knight Returns The Dark Knight Triumphant Hunt the Dark Knight The Dark Knight Falls Publication history The original indicia of each issue states that the series was titled Batman: The Dark Knight . Several early collected editions also left out the words Returns from the cover title. Influence Comics Batman: The Dark Knight is often heralded as one of the biggest influences on the Modern Age of Comic Books , alongside Alan Moore \\'s Watchmen . The series notably revitalized interest in Batman, which had been waning since the 1970s. Although not the first Batman work to implement a darker tone, the series helped popularize grimmer takes on the character and move away from light-hearted approaches, which were heavily associated with him due to the popularity of the 1960s series . Elements of Batman\\'s costumes, specifically short ears on the cowl and pouch-based Utility Belt , would be adapted into other variations and artists\\' designs. The evaluation of the character\\'s psychology would be in other works, including Grant Morrison \\'s Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth . Original characters from the series, such as Carrie Kelley and the Mutants , have also appeared in the main-continuities and other depictions. Several art pieces from the series, notably Batman crouching on a line , have appeared throughout the franchise and promotional work. Plot points from the series would also make it into DC\\'s New Earth and Prime Earth, notably the death of Jason Todd . Several moments of Batman\\'s origin, notably discovering the Batcave as a child and the pearls falling from his mother\\'s neck, also originate from the series. The Exoframe Batsuit used in the battle with Superman has also inspired other armors used by Batman to fight superpowered enemies, such as the Thrasher Suit and Justice Buster Batsuit . Elements of the story have also appeared in works related to Superman and Green Arrow . Film Tim Burton , director of the 1989 Batman film and Batman Returns , cited Batman: The Dark Knight as great influence on his works with the character. Joel Schumacher had also pitched a live-action adaptation of the series to Warner Bros. after finishing Batman Forever and the later cancelation of Batman Unchained . However, both times had the proposal shelved in favor of both Batman & Robin and Batman: DarKnight , respectively. Christopher Nolan \\'s would take several influences from Miller\\'s Batman: The Dark Knight . The most consistent over the films including the Tumbler (the films\\' version of the Batmobile ) being a large military vehicle intended for warfare like the Riot Tank Batmobile used in the comic. The second film, The Dark Knight , also features a group of vigilante copycats similar to the Sons of Batman . The third film in the trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises , takes the most influence from the series and even lifts several plotlines. The most notable include a retired Batman returning to fight crime after years of absence, the GCPD learning of it when he intervenes in a car chase, his confrontations with Bane mirroring both fights with the Mutant Leader , and Bruce Wayne faking his death to find a life away from the cowl. Batman also uses a Mechanized Leg Brace to enhance his strength, having lost much of it over years of retirement. The 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice also took heavy influence from The Dark Knight comic series, even featuring many visual and dialogue references to the series. The film\\'s depiction of Batman also takes influence from the series\\' version, including the character being at middle-age, wearing a similar Batsuit design , and being depicted as more brutal and willing to use lethal force. The film also takes pieces of dialogue and moments are directly lifted from the series, most notably Alfred \\'s concerns about the lack of future Wayne generations, Superman being weakened by a nuclear weapon\\'s detonation, and the hostage situation from The Dark Knight Triumphant (though the film switches the toddler with Martha Kent and shows a decisively lethal outcome for the captor). The fight with Superman also takes many elements of the climax, such as Batman using an heavily-armored Batsuit , using ultra-sonic weaponry to cause a sensory overload, and using Kryptonite gas to weaken his opponent. The 2019 film Joker also lifts the talk-show scene from the comic, with its host Murray Franklin being based on David Endocrine . The Riot Tank Batmobile also appears in new material filmed for scene for the director\\'s cut of Justice League , appearing in the \"Knightmare\" post-credits scene. Animation The New Batman Adventures would adapt the second issue ( The Dark Knight Triumphant ) as a segment in the episode \" Legends of the Dark Knight \". However, the story was heavily condensed and the segment removes several moments to retain a family audience, such as Batman shooting a member of the mutants and the initial encounter with the Mutant Leader. In The Batman animated series episode \" Artifacts \", a future version of the series\\' Batman bares a muscular similar to the comic\\'s version, such as the muscular design, larger bat-symbol and use of strength-enhancing technology. The Batman: The Brave and the Bold also pays homage to The Dark Knight Returns in the episode \" The Rise of the Blue Beetle! \", with the cover appearing as a poster on Jamie Reyes\\' bedroom wall. The entire series was adapted into an animated feature directed by Jay Oliva and released in two parts from September, 2012 to January, 2013. A combination of the two was released on October 2013. Television In the TV series Gotham , the episode \" The Gentle Art of Making Enemies \" has a confrontation between Bruce Wayne and Jerome Valeska (the series\\' first incarnation of the Joker) take place in a Hall of Mirrors. The comic\\'s depiction of the Joker was also used as influence for Jerome\\'s brother Jeremiah Valeska , such as him being render catatonic and returning after Bruce\\'s return ten years later. The Arrowverse also features a version of Batman based on the comic\\'s version of the character, with references to antagonism with Superman and dialogue lifted straight from the series\\' climax. Video Games The video game Batman: Arkham Knight features a version of the Batmobile that can turn into a riot-response tank similar to the series\\' version of the vehicle. The game implies the design was chosen due to something darker taking control of his psyche and influencing him to implement these. However, the riot-tank features of the Batmobile are decisively non-lethal, whereas the comic\\'s is implied to be capable of deadly force but never used.', 'The Dark Knight General Information Type: Limited Series Total Issues: 4 Published: February – June 1986 Creators: Frank Miller Lynn Varley Batman: The Dark Knight is a four issue mini-series written and drawn by acclaimed author Frank Miller , first published by DC Comics in 1986.

Animation The New Batman Adventures would adapt the second issue ( The Dark Knight Triumphant ) as a segment in the episode \" Legends of the Dark Knight \". However, the story was heavily condensed and the segment removes several moments to retain a family audience, such as Batman shooting a member of the mutants and the initial encounter with the Mutant Leader. In The Batman animated series episode \" Artifacts \", a future version of the series\\' Batman bares a muscular similar to the comic\\'s version, such as the muscular design, larger bat-symbol and use of strength-enhancing technology. The Batman: The Brave and the Bold also pays homage to The Dark Knight Returns in the episode \" The Rise of the Blue Beetle! \", with the cover appearing as a poster on Jamie Reyes\\' bedroom wall. The entire series was adapted into an animated feature directed by Jay Oliva and released in two parts from September, 2012 to January, 2013. A combination of the two was released on October 2013. Television In the TV series Gotham , the episode \" The Gentle Art of Making Enemies \" has a confrontation between Bruce Wayne and Jerome Valeska (the series\\' first incarnation of the Joker) take place in a Hall of Mirrors. The comic\\'s depiction of the Joker was also used as influence for Jerome\\'s brother Jeremiah Valeska , such as him being render catatonic and returning after Bruce\\'s return ten years later. The Arrowverse also features a version of Batman based on the comic\\'s version of the character, with references to antagonism with Superman and dialogue lifted straight from the series\\' climax. Video Games The video game Batman: Arkham Knight features a version of the Batmobile that can turn into a riot-response tank similar to the series\\' version of the vehicle. The game implies the design was chosen due to something darker taking control of his psyche and influencing him to implement these. However, the riot-tank features of the Batmobile are decisively non-lethal, whereas the comic\\'s is implied to be capable of deadly force but never used.'],\n",
      "    response='Yes, Batman comics and movies share many core similarities, but there are also notable differences in how storylines, characters, and themes are adapted, which can affect how faithfully the essence of the comics is captured. For instance, both mediums feature Batman\\'s origin as Bruce Wayne, his fight against villains like the Joker and Two-Face, and themes of justice, vigilantism, and moral ambiguity. Comics like Frank Miller\\'s \"The Dark Knight\" have directly influenced movies, such as Christopher Nolan\\'s trilogy (e.g., \"The Dark Knight Rises\" borrows elements like Batman\\'s retirement and return, as well as his confrontations with foes). However, movies often simplify complex comic storylines for runtime and audience appeal, resulting in a more action-oriented or visually spectacular take—Nolan\\'s films emphasize realism and psychological depth, while earlier ones like Tim Burton\\'s are more gothic and stylized. Comics tend to explore darker, more introspective themes and multiple timelines, which might not translate perfectly to films due to budget or rating constraints.\\n\\nTo help you decide if the movies capture the comics\\' essence, consider starting with Nolan\\'s trilogy if you want a closer adaptation of the gritty comic style, or the 1989 \"Batman\" for a fun, visual contrast. If you\\'re looking at accuracy, comics like \"The Dark Knight Returns\" offer a raw, dystopian edge that films sometimes tone down. Would you like recommendations on specific comics to compare with a movie, or details on how a particular character evolves across media? This can guide your enjoyment or discussions further.'\n",

As the Waynes\\' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father\\'s business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler, Alfred Pennyworth , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents\\' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City. As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named Ethan Bennett . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\". As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents\\' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot. For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman\\'s activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police Angel Rojas took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named Ellen Yin , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham. In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date – the Joker . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes. The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham\\'s underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named Bane . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of the Penguin , Man-Bat , Killer Croc , Cluemaster and Catwoman . One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce\\'s career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface. Some time later, a new character entered the Batman\\'s life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally. Barbara Gordon , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordan , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend Poison Ivy from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara\\'s aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt. The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist Dick Grayson was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named Tony Zucco . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick\\'s acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force. Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself John Jones . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called the Joining . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth\\'s atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John\\'s behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as Lex Luthor . At some point later, in the year 2027, Mr. Freeze had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named Nightwing . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever. One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave\\'s titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman\\'s legacy survived into the future.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate . His primary form of combat is a harmonious mixture of Jui-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Judo, Muay Thai, Savate, Karate, Kung Fu, Boxing, Capoeira, Krav Maga, Aikido, and Ninjutsu. Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21. He has mastered Diverse Environmental Training, Security Systems, and illusion/sleight of hand by the time he was 23. He gained even more degrees in Biology, Physics, Advanced Chemistry, and Technology by the time he was 25. He has learned Forensic, Medical Sciences, Expanded Computer and Engineering Sciences, and Expanded Device Pool use of personal powered armor and system, database creation on underworld crime bosses, rogue\\'s gallery foes and other supers; improved material sciences for body armor and micro-machinery by the time he was 26. Has also learned Advanced New Development in Forensic and Medical Sciences. Master Tactician : He is a master strategist and tactician commonly utilizes extremely cunning tactics, strategies, and protocols to outwit his foes. He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture. Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill.

Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang.

He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23.

The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham.

Batman is the secret identity of billionaire Bruce Wayne , the CEO of Wayne Enterprises, who, after witnessing the death of his parents, vowed to spend the rest of his life warring on all criminals. He is a founding member of the Justice League .

As the Waynes\\' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father\\'s business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler, Alfred Pennyworth , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents\\' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City. As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named Ethan Bennett . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\". As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents\\' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot. For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman\\'s activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police Angel Rojas took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named Ellen Yin , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham. In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date – the Joker . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes. The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham\\'s underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named Bane . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of the Penguin , Man-Bat , Killer Croc , Cluemaster and Catwoman . One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce\\'s career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface. Some time later, a new character entered the Batman\\'s life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally. Barbara Gordon , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordan , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend Poison Ivy from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara\\'s aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt. The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist Dick Grayson was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named Tony Zucco . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick\\'s acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force. Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself John Jones . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called the Joining . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth\\'s atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John\\'s behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as Lex Luthor . At some point later, in the year 2027, Mr. Freeze had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named Nightwing . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever. One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave\\'s titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman\\'s legacy survived into the future. Appearance Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights. He also wears a dark gray costume with a black bat-emblem, black trunks, gloves, and knee high boots. Powers and Abilities Master Acrobat: Excellent in gymnastics and acrobatics.

His personal favourite was the Gray Ghost , watching the television show with his father. On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to Wonder Woman , Bruce hadn\\'t been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes\\' faithful friend and butler, Alfred Pennyworth Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from Yoru Sensei . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor\\'s daughter Zatanna became very close. As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with Andrea Beaumont . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\". War on Crime Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the Batcave . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city\\'s underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in Dick Grayson as his ward after witnessing his parents\\' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down their murderer . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and Commissioner James Gordon , working with them to control crime in Gotham. Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included the Penguin , Poison Ivy , Mr. Freeze and the Scarecrow . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including Catwoman and Two-Face . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered the Joker , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created. New Adventures Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as Batwoman . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called Batgirl began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father\\'s legacy as the next Police Commissioner. Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned Tim Drake from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder. Joining Up For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called Blüdhaven . Batman would later find himself in Metropolis , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with Lex Luthor , Batman would find himself working with Superman to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker\\'s plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue\\'s gallery. He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another\\'s home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity. Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper. It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world\\'s greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League. Saving the World Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech\\'s deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station\\'s antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J\\'onn J\\'onzz\\' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna\\'s destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch. Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman\\'s mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don\\'t even think about it\". When the Imperium\\'s attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation. Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J\\'onn J\\'onzz. After freeing J\\'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J\\'onn J\\'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of Wonder Woman . The Flash arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing\\'s severed wing. After J\\'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium\\'s invasion of Mars , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium\\'s factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun\\'s rays. The heroes split up to disable the factories. Batman went to Giza, Egypt with Wonder Woman and J\\'onn J\\'onzz. The trio infiltrated the factory and found the Ion Matrix Crystal, a vital component of the plant. Batman and Wonder Woman provided a diversion to allow J\\'onzz to remove the crystal. As he removed the crystal, J\\'onzz was incapacitated by Imperium forces. Batman then covered Wonder Woman and J\\'onzz\\' escape from the plant, but was himself trapped inside and cornered by Imperium forces. J\\'onzz reported that Batman was dead, but in truth, he had mentally shielded Batman to prevent the Imperium forces from detecting him. Batman remained hidden until the Imperium arrived on Earth. He then revealed himself and reversed the ion charge in the Ion Matrix Crystal, causing the plant to burn off the smoke it had been producing. With the sun shining again, the heroes defeated the Imperium and freed their human prisoners, then mopped up the remaining Imperium forces around the globe. Inspired by a general\\'s speech about vigilance and the possible return of the invaders, Batman had the Watchtower constructed by Wayne Enterprises, hiding the funding as a \"line item in the aerospace R&D budget\". Batman invited the other six heroes who had repelled the invaders to the station. The seven heroes formed the Justice League. Claiming he wasn\\'t a \"people person\", Batman did not officially join the League, though he did offer to be on call when the League needed his help. Long considered the brains of the League, Batman often found solutions that eluded the other members. He was quick to place himself in danger, despite the awe-inspiring powers of his teammates. During the Atlantis Usurpation, Batman put a stop to the melting of the Polar Ice Caps. On another occasion, Batman single-handedly defeated five dangerous criminals before being taken prisoner by an Amazon trained criminal. During his time with the League, Batman showed his distrust of Superman. After Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid and when Batman had to pull Superman back later when he attempted to end Darkseid\\'s life, Batman began carrying a piece of Kryptonite, which was revealed when the android Amazo copied Superman\\'s powers. However, Batman still held a deep respect for the Man of Steel, especially after he had seemingly died at the hands of Toyman. But, regardless of his respect, Batman remained stubborn in his disbelief in Superman\\'s death, and refused to mourn for him for quite a while. During the Thanagarian Invasion of Earth, Batman was forced to reveal his identity to his teammates. After successfully retaking the Watchtower from Thanagarian Forces, Batman piloted the Watchtower through the Earth\\'s atmosphere in an attempt to plunge it into a Hyperspace Bypass, a city-wide machine that would generate a wormhole through the Earth. As Batman lost consciousness due to the heat surrounding him, Superman rescued him and as the Watchtower destroyed the Bypass Generator. With the Watchtower\\'s destruction and Hawkgirl \\'s resignation from the League, Batman and the five other members reformed the Justice League with a new Watchtower and an expanded roster of heroes. Batman was instrumental in recruiting Green Arrow into the League, who along with other human league members, helped keep the League from becoming an autonomous Metahuman army. With Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, Batman fought Chronos across time, an adventure during which he met another Batman as well as his older self. He also succeeded in demonstrating to Amanda Waller that Cadmus was being used as a tool to further Lex Luthor\\'s personal agenda to discredit and destroy the Justice League. Amanda Waller was so impressed with Batman that she created Project Batman Beyond to ensure that the world would always have a Batman. Joker\\'s Final Joke After these events, Robin went missing for three weeks while on patrol, with Batman and Batgirl searching for him, until they learned he was at Arkham Asylum . They encounter Joker and Harley Quinn , who reveal that they adopted a son named J.J.(Joker, Jr.), who was actually Robin brainwashed and driven insane. Joker seems to escape, with Batman hot in pursuit. However, he was actually trying to lure Batman into Arkham\\'s Cineplex, where he reveals that he subjected Robin to countless amounts of psychological and physical tortures, and because of this, Joker now knows Batman\\'s true identity, and everything about him. Batman, enraged at the cruelty and torture Joker inflicted onto Robin, smashes through the theater box, and beats Joker down (wrecking the projector in the process, causing Joker to say \"If you don\\'t like the movie, I\\'ve got slides!\"), then hurls Joker down to the room that J.J.\\'s in. Batman threatens to break Joker in half, causing the Joker to retort that he would have done it years ago if he really wanted to do it. Suddenly, The Joker draws a switchblade, and slices Batman\\'s chest, as well as stabs his leg. He then gives what looks like a gun to J.J. and tells him to kill Batman (or, in his words, \"deliver the punchline.\"). J.J. then pulls the trigger, revealing the gun to actually be the infamous \"Bang!\" flag spear gun that is one of the Joker\\'s trademark weapons. J.J. apparently hesitates to kill Batman, causing the Joker to shout \"DO IT!\". Tim reluctantly obliges. Instead of killing Batman however, he instead turns it away at the last second, thus shooting the Joker instead, killing him. J.J. half laughs and half sobs at the events, and Batgirl (having arrived after her fight with Harley Quinn) tries to console him. Commissioner Gordon and Batman later bury the body of Joker in the ruins of Arkham, and Tim is taken to Doctor Leslie Thompkins for rehabilitation. After these events, Batman forbade Tim Drake from ever becoming Robin again. Tim attempted to go solo for a few years, but in the end quit the super-hero life, got married and had children. He broke off contact with Bruce but remained close with Barbara and perhaps Dick. Also, as a result of the fight, Batman walked with a slight limp which in his later years would force him to walk with a cane. Late Adventures Many years passed following the attack of the Joker on the Bat-Family, Bruce entered middle age and began to suffer with a bad heart from the effects of a hard life of crime fighting. Batman developed a powered high tech suit (which had longer Bat ears and minus a cape) that augmented his physical abilities and allowed him to continue the never-ending battle for a few more years. At this time, his corporate rivalry with Derek Powers began, and Wayne Enterprises resisted a hostile bid for corporate takeover. However, injuries suffered through the long decades of physical punishment and an ailing heart finally took their toll, and even the suit couldn\\'t compensate any longer. While attempting to rescue his old friend Veronica Vreeland\\'s daughter Bunny Vreeland from kidnappers, Batman managed to subdue the kidnappers with limited effort until he was forced to point a gun at a common thug to save Ms. Vreeland and his own life after suffering a heart attack while in the midst of the fight. Injured, Batman limps outside the hangar, removing his mask upon realizing he was wielding a handgun, forced to rely on the weapon of his parents\\' cowardly murderer to defend himself against criminals. Ashamed, Bruce returns to the Batcave, where he places the Batsuit in the costume display gallery. Walking to the top of the stairs, Bruce takes one last look at the Batcave and solemnly vows, \"Never again.\" Vowing to never again wear the cowl, Bruce then shuts off the lights, and leaves his past in the darkness. Passing the Mantle of the Bat When he hung up the mantle of the bat, Bruce came a recluse, shut off in Wayne Manor with his dog, Ace. He withdrew from the day to day operations of Wayne Enterprises, a decision that left the company vulnerable to a takeover by Derek Powers and caused Wayne much regret. It was now the year 2039 and Bruce Wayne had become a very old man. Chance brought teen-aged Terry McGinnis to the gates of Wayne Manor, where he learned of Bruce\\'s past secret life. After McGinnis suffered the loss of his father, Bruce reluctantly agreed to allow him to take up mantle of Batman. Bruce then served as a mentor and informant for the successor to his legacy. For years, Bruce coordinated with Terry, supplying advice and direction from the Batcave while McGinnis worked in the field. He also ran the labs and developed new gadgets for Terry to use in the new crusade against crime. The elderly Bruce Wayne occasionally ventured into the field to support Terry. His sense of duty and self-sacrifice ever present, he once donned a suit of Batman armor to rescue Terry from the villain Inque, despite Inque\\'s Metahuman power and the strain produced on Bruce\\'s already damaged heart. As Bruce continued to age, he suffered a kidney failure. When it was discovered that Terry was not just a suitable donor but a perfect one, their relationship reached its weakest point; Terry, like Dick Grayson before him, felt betrayed, manipulated, and outright used. He set off to uncover the truth from someone willing to reveal it. Terry confronted Amanda Waller and learned the truth about his heritage. In her earlier years, Waller realized the world would always need a Batman. Taking fate into her own hands (unbeknownst to Bruce), she gathered a sample of Bruce Wayne\\'s genetic material, after a battle that left Batman in need of medical attention. Using her Cadmus connections, Waller implanted this genetic material into a young Warren McGinnis, replacing his genetic material with Bruce\\'s. Thus, Terry McGinnis was born, the son of Bruce Wayne, sharing half his genetic code. Terry returned to Wayne Manor with a new sense of purpose. Bruce wondered about the fate of Gotham, and Terry replied \"I\\'ve got it covered. Always.\" Their relationship repaired; Bruce had truly become the father Terry had lost long ago. The Savage Timeline In an alternate timeline created by Vandal Savage, the Axis forces won World War II. There, Bruce Wayne lost his parents when they spoke out against the regime and became Batman to fight Savage and his forces. He served as the leader of the resistance movement, recruiting other victims. Unlike his original self, Batman was willing to use guns without a second thought. When the Justice League from the original timeline arrived, Batman helped them escape from the authorities and learned of our timeline. He assisted them in breaking into the facility where the time portal was kept. However, Batman did not accompany the League into the past to thwart Savage, preferring to stay behind and lead the resistance in case they failed. It is assumed that this reality ceased to exist when the League defeated Savage and counteract the Axis powers\\' artificial advantages. Powers and Abilities Through his years of intensive physical training, the Batman represents the peak of human physical conditioning. Batman is at peak human levels of strength, stamina, agility, coordination, reflexes, speed, and durability. Even well into old age, Bruce Wayne still demonstrated that he could manhandle other much younger men with ease. Batman\\'s martial arts discipline was never mentioned, in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Bruce Wayne mentions Ju Jitsu. Batman was also a master of stealth and infiltration (all the more remarkable given that he stands 6\\'2\" and weighs 215 lbs), and often revealed himself to his enemies when they least suspected him to. This also allowed him to just disappear from allies in mid-sentence, a habit that frequently annoyed the likes of Commissioner Gordon (\"one of these days I\\'m gonna nail his feet to the ground\") and Harvey Bullock (\"I wonder how the Commish puts up with that\"). Batman was capable of incredible feats of agility. During the Second Apokolyptian invasion, Darkseid commented with much surprise that Batman had been the first one to dodge his Omega Beams. With his martial arts prowess, occasionally augmented by technology, Batman was usually more than a match for any foe he encountered, human or otherwise. Equipment As the head of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce Wayne has access to cutting edge technology and Batman makes good use of it in his field equipment.

Contents 1 History 1.1 DCnU 2 Behind the scenes 3 In other media 4 See Also History Although as a young boy Bruce Wayne lost his parents to a gun-wielding robber , as his vigilante alter-ego Batman, he took firearms into his war on crime. The Batman of Earth-Two did not have the same \"no-guns\" policy as his Earth-One counterpart. He often wore a holster on his utility belt that carried his pistol and had a machine gun mounted on the Batplane. Batman had to rescue his girlfriend Julie Madison from the vampires The Monk and Dala . When he found them resting in their coffins he shot them both dead with silver bullets. After tracking down Dr. Hugo Strange and his mutated men, Batman opened fire on the disfigured humans from the Batplane . On several other occasions, the gun on his utility belt was clearly visible. Considered a vigilante by the police because he killed many of his early opponents, Wayne as Batman proved to be effective against the open acting crime organizations that the ineffective Gotham City police force could not. Batman began gathering the grudging admiration of then Police Commissioner James Gordon in his efforts, despite Batman\\'s lethal methods of crime combating operations. The Caped Crusader joined the Justice Society of America to unite heroes against the threat of Nazi Germany during World War II. Batman later married his former foe Catwoman and became the father of Huntress (Helena Wayne) . DCnU Bruce Wayne was a man of many options, suited for almost any task he was forced to make hard decisions during the end of the world. Prior to the Apokolips War Bruce Wayne fought crime as Batman and eventually fell in love with former villain Selina Kyle who went by the alias Catwoman. The two got married and eventually had a daughter that they named Helena Wayne . Bruce originally did not want his daughter to become involved in his hero life believing it would endanger her, but ended up letting her be Robin after Selina died and when the Apokolips War began. When Steppenwolf brought the Parademons to Metropolis and across the world with boom tubes he wasted no time destroying Gotham City as well. On his last day, Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman devised a plan to destroy the remaining towers erected by Steppenwolf. Batman died after giving his last words to his daughter as the virus he planted caused the tower he was in to explode. Behind the scenes Batman in earlier comics also frequently killed villains and thugs by punching or kicking them into vats of acid, or off roofs. In other media In Batman , Bruce Wayne was similar to the gun-toting Batman of Earth-Two. He opened fire on the Joker with the Batwing . Presumably an attempt to shoot Joker with the Batwing\\'s guns and rockets, but missed hitting a few Goons . Over the course of the film series, he killed a handful of other minor character amidst collateral damage or fighting at the top of the cathedral. Notable exceptions in the sequels included the brutal executions of the circus strongman and Two-Face . In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice , Batman is even more casually murderous, using vehicular mounted weaponry. See Also Batman (Earth-2)/Gallery Batman Batman (Disambiguation)'],\n",

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded.

Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill.

Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate .

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21.

He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber.

Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition.

Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded.

Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill.

The two operated as superheroes under the aliases of Gotham and Gotham Girl . After Hank\\'s death, Claire joined the Batman family, though she fell under the influence of the Psycho Pirate and Bane . Contents 1 Biography 1.1 Debut in Gotham 1.2 Under Psycho Pirate\\'s Control 2 Powers and Abilities Biography Like her brother, Claire Clover was a fan of Batman, after her family were saved from a mugging by the vigilante. Hoping to help him in return for his deeds, the two bought experimental treatment that granted them similar powers to Superman . However, whilst using them, they would draw off their life span, meaning they could only live for two years with similar powers as the man of steel or an hour with the powers of a god. After undergoing the therapy, they began operating as superheroes under the aliases of \"Gotham\" and \"Gotham Girl\". Debut in Gotham Claire first met Batman when she and Hank, as their superhero identities, saved both him and a plane from crashing into the Gotham bay. Taken under the wing by the Dark Knight, they assisted him in a battle with Solomon Grundy , and the investigation of the confession and suicide of a man in the commissioner\\'s office. After a month of operating and assisting in saving civilians off a falling bridge, they were drawn to an explosion within the city and were confronted by Professor Strange and Psycho Pirate . Manipulating their feelings, Pirate made the two afraid, causing Hank to kill twenty-three of the criminals\\' followers and Claire to be paralyzed with fear. The surviving member would later kill their parents after discovering their identities. Taken to the Batcave to recuperate and inspired by a conversation between her and Duke Thomas , Claire would join Batman and the entire Justice League to battle an insane Hank, during which he died from overusing his powers. The following week, Claire suffered a similar effect to her brother, talking herself as if she was conversing with him whilst continuing to operate as Gotham Girl. During this time, she battled some of Batman\\'s lesser known enemies like Colonel Blimp , Captain Stingaree and Kite Man . Confronting her on a rooftop, Batman revealed his identity to her and offered her help dealing with the trauma. Claire accepted, breaking down in the vigilante\\'s arms as she admitted how much she missed her brother. After the encounter, she helped Batman capture Strange and defeat his Monster Men .

However, Psycho Pirate manipulated her into joining Bane , the two planning to use her in the latter\\'s schemes. Aiming to destroy Batman on a personal level, they used the Medusa Mask\\'s powers to push her to Bane\\'s side, using them to manipulate Batman into proposing to Catwoman . When Bane took over Gotham City, Gotham Girl was taken in by the Flashpoint Batman as his \"Robin\". Under his influence, she helped bring the city under the control of the supervillains and used as a deterrent for other superheroes, proving her potential by defeating Captain Atom . Batman was eventually able to defeat both villains and restore Claire to her regular state. Some time after the battle\\'s end, Claire was exposed to Platinum Kryptonite , which restored her lost lifespan. Powers and Abilities Ultra Powers : Claire has \"ultra\" powers which let her tap into a vast array of abilities (typically resembling those of Superman ) albeit with a great cost. The more of her powers she used, the more it drained her physical lifespan. Among these powers were flight, super-strength, superhuman stamina, invulnerability and endurance, and Ultra-Vision. Batman eventually negated Claire\\'s condition by exposing her to Platinum Kryptonite , restoring her lifespan and giving her the powers permanently.', 'Batman General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne Aliases: Batman The Batman The Dark Knight The World\\'s Greatest Detective The Caped Crusader Portrayed by: Kevin Conroy (voice) Appearances: Batman: The Animated Series Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero The Batman/Superman Movie Batman Beyond Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Static Shock Justice League Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Justice League Unlimited Batman is a costumed crimefighter who is actually billionaire Bruce Wayne by day.

His personal favourite was the Gray Ghost , watching the television show with his father. On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to Wonder Woman , Bruce hadn\\'t been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes\\' faithful friend and butler, Alfred Pennyworth Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from Yoru Sensei . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor\\'s daughter Zatanna became very close. As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with Andrea Beaumont . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\". War on Crime Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the Batcave . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city\\'s underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in Dick Grayson as his ward after witnessing his parents\\' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down their murderer . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and Commissioner James Gordon , working with them to control crime in Gotham. Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included the Penguin , Poison Ivy , Mr. Freeze and the Scarecrow . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including Catwoman and Two-Face . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered the Joker , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created. New Adventures Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as Batwoman . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called Batgirl began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father\\'s legacy as the next Police Commissioner. Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned Tim Drake from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder. Joining Up For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called Blüdhaven . Batman would later find himself in Metropolis , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with Lex Luthor , Batman would find himself working with Superman to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker\\'s plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue\\'s gallery. He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another\\'s home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity. Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper. It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world\\'s greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League. Saving the World Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech\\'s deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station\\'s antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J\\'onn J\\'onzz\\' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna\\'s destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch. Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman\\'s mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don\\'t even think about it\". When the Imperium\\'s attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation. Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J\\'onn J\\'onzz. After freeing J\\'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J\\'onn J\\'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of Wonder Woman . The Flash arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing\\'s severed wing. After J\\'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium\\'s invasion of Mars , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium\\'s factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun\\'s rays. The heroes split up to disable the factories. Batman went to Giza, Egypt with Wonder Woman and J\\'onn J\\'onzz. The trio infiltrated the factory and found the Ion Matrix Crystal, a vital component of the plant. Batman and Wonder Woman provided a diversion to allow J\\'onzz to remove the crystal. As he removed the crystal, J\\'onzz was incapacitated by Imperium forces. Batman then covered Wonder Woman and J\\'onzz\\' escape from the plant, but was himself trapped inside and cornered by Imperium forces. J\\'onzz reported that Batman was dead, but in truth, he had mentally shielded Batman to prevent the Imperium forces from detecting him. Batman remained hidden until the Imperium arrived on Earth. He then revealed himself and reversed the ion charge in the Ion Matrix Crystal, causing the plant to burn off the smoke it had been producing. With the sun shining again, the heroes defeated the Imperium and freed their human prisoners, then mopped up the remaining Imperium forces around the globe. Inspired by a general\\'s speech about vigilance and the possible return of the invaders, Batman had the Watchtower constructed by Wayne Enterprises, hiding the funding as a \"line item in the aerospace R&D budget\". Batman invited the other six heroes who had repelled the invaders to the station. The seven heroes formed the Justice League. Claiming he wasn\\'t a \"people person\", Batman did not officially join the League, though he did offer to be on call when the League needed his help. Long considered the brains of the League, Batman often found solutions that eluded the other members. He was quick to place himself in danger, despite the awe-inspiring powers of his teammates. During the Atlantis Usurpation, Batman put a stop to the melting of the Polar Ice Caps. On another occasion, Batman single-handedly defeated five dangerous criminals before being taken prisoner by an Amazon trained criminal. During his time with the League, Batman showed his distrust of Superman. After Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid and when Batman had to pull Superman back later when he attempted to end Darkseid\\'s life, Batman began carrying a piece of Kryptonite, which was revealed when the android Amazo copied Superman\\'s powers. However, Batman still held a deep respect for the Man of Steel, especially after he had seemingly died at the hands of Toyman. But, regardless of his respect, Batman remained stubborn in his disbelief in Superman\\'s death, and refused to mourn for him for quite a while. During the Thanagarian Invasion of Earth, Batman was forced to reveal his identity to his teammates. After successfully retaking the Watchtower from Thanagarian Forces, Batman piloted the Watchtower through the Earth\\'s atmosphere in an attempt to plunge it into a Hyperspace Bypass, a city-wide machine that would generate a wormhole through the Earth. As Batman lost consciousness due to the heat surrounding him, Superman rescued him and as the Watchtower destroyed the Bypass Generator. With the Watchtower\\'s destruction and Hawkgirl \\'s resignation from the League, Batman and the five other members reformed the Justice League with a new Watchtower and an expanded roster of heroes. Batman was instrumental in recruiting Green Arrow into the League, who along with other human league members, helped keep the League from becoming an autonomous Metahuman army. With Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, Batman fought Chronos across time, an adventure during which he met another Batman as well as his older self. He also succeeded in demonstrating to Amanda Waller that Cadmus was being used as a tool to further Lex Luthor\\'s personal agenda to discredit and destroy the Justice League. Amanda Waller was so impressed with Batman that she created Project Batman Beyond to ensure that the world would always have a Batman. Joker\\'s Final Joke After these events, Robin went missing for three weeks while on patrol, with Batman and Batgirl searching for him, until they learned he was at Arkham Asylum . They encounter Joker and Harley Quinn , who reveal that they adopted a son named J.J.(Joker, Jr.), who was actually Robin brainwashed and driven insane. Joker seems to escape, with Batman hot in pursuit. However, he was actually trying to lure Batman into Arkham\\'s Cineplex, where he reveals that he subjected Robin to countless amounts of psychological and physical tortures, and because of this, Joker now knows Batman\\'s true identity, and everything about him. Batman, enraged at the cruelty and torture Joker inflicted onto Robin, smashes through the theater box, and beats Joker down (wrecking the projector in the process, causing Joker to say \"If you don\\'t like the movie, I\\'ve got slides!\"), then hurls Joker down to the room that J.J.\\'s in. Batman threatens to break Joker in half, causing the Joker to retort that he would have done it years ago if he really wanted to do it. Suddenly, The Joker draws a switchblade, and slices Batman\\'s chest, as well as stabs his leg. He then gives what looks like a gun to J.J. and tells him to kill Batman (or, in his words, \"deliver the punchline.\"). J.J. then pulls the trigger, revealing the gun to actually be the infamous \"Bang!\" flag spear gun that is one of the Joker\\'s trademark weapons. J.J. apparently hesitates to kill Batman, causing the Joker to shout \"DO IT!\". Tim reluctantly obliges. Instead of killing Batman however, he instead turns it away at the last second, thus shooting the Joker instead, killing him. J.J. half laughs and half sobs at the events, and Batgirl (having arrived after her fight with Harley Quinn) tries to console him. Commissioner Gordon and Batman later bury the body of Joker in the ruins of Arkham, and Tim is taken to Doctor Leslie Thompkins for rehabilitation. After these events, Batman forbade Tim Drake from ever becoming Robin again. Tim attempted to go solo for a few years, but in the end quit the super-hero life, got married and had children. He broke off contact with Bruce but remained close with Barbara and perhaps Dick. Also, as a result of the fight, Batman walked with a slight limp which in his later years would force him to walk with a cane. Late Adventures Many years passed following the attack of the Joker on the Bat-Family, Bruce entered middle age and began to suffer with a bad heart from the effects of a hard life of crime fighting. Batman developed a powered high tech suit (which had longer Bat ears and minus a cape) that augmented his physical abilities and allowed him to continue the never-ending battle for a few more years. At this time, his corporate rivalry with Derek Powers began, and Wayne Enterprises resisted a hostile bid for corporate takeover. However, injuries suffered through the long decades of physical punishment and an ailing heart finally took their toll, and even the suit couldn\\'t compensate any longer. While attempting to rescue his old friend Veronica Vreeland\\'s daughter Bunny Vreeland from kidnappers, Batman managed to subdue the kidnappers with limited effort until he was forced to point a gun at a common thug to save Ms. Vreeland and his own life after suffering a heart attack while in the midst of the fight. Injured, Batman limps outside the hangar, removing his mask upon realizing he was wielding a handgun, forced to rely on the weapon of his parents\\' cowardly murderer to defend himself against criminals. Ashamed, Bruce returns to the Batcave, where he places the Batsuit in the costume display gallery. Walking to the top of the stairs, Bruce takes one last look at the Batcave and solemnly vows, \"Never again.\" Vowing to never again wear the cowl, Bruce then shuts off the lights, and leaves his past in the darkness. Passing the Mantle of the Bat When he hung up the mantle of the bat, Bruce came a recluse, shut off in Wayne Manor with his dog, Ace. He withdrew from the day to day operations of Wayne Enterprises, a decision that left the company vulnerable to a takeover by Derek Powers and caused Wayne much regret. It was now the year 2039 and Bruce Wayne had become a very old man. Chance brought teen-aged Terry McGinnis to the gates of Wayne Manor, where he learned of Bruce\\'s past secret life. After McGinnis suffered the loss of his father, Bruce reluctantly agreed to allow him to take up mantle of Batman. Bruce then served as a mentor and informant for the successor to his legacy. For years, Bruce coordinated with Terry, supplying advice and direction from the Batcave while McGinnis worked in the field. He also ran the labs and developed new gadgets for Terry to use in the new crusade against crime. The elderly Bruce Wayne occasionally ventured into the field to support Terry. His sense of duty and self-sacrifice ever present, he once donned a suit of Batman armor to rescue Terry from the villain Inque, despite Inque\\'s Metahuman power and the strain produced on Bruce\\'s already damaged heart. As Bruce continued to age, he suffered a kidney failure. When it was discovered that Terry was not just a suitable donor but a perfect one, their relationship reached its weakest point; Terry, like Dick Grayson before him, felt betrayed, manipulated, and outright used. He set off to uncover the truth from someone willing to reveal it. Terry confronted Amanda Waller and learned the truth about his heritage. In her earlier years, Waller realized the world would always need a Batman. Taking fate into her own hands (unbeknownst to Bruce), she gathered a sample of Bruce Wayne\\'s genetic material, after a battle that left Batman in need of medical attention. Using her Cadmus connections, Waller implanted this genetic material into a young Warren McGinnis, replacing his genetic material with Bruce\\'s. Thus, Terry McGinnis was born, the son of Bruce Wayne, sharing half his genetic code. Terry returned to Wayne Manor with a new sense of purpose. Bruce wondered about the fate of Gotham, and Terry replied \"I\\'ve got it covered. Always.\" Their relationship repaired; Bruce had truly become the father Terry had lost long ago. The Savage Timeline In an alternate timeline created by Vandal Savage, the Axis forces won World War II. There, Bruce Wayne lost his parents when they spoke out against the regime and became Batman to fight Savage and his forces. He served as the leader of the resistance movement, recruiting other victims. Unlike his original self, Batman was willing to use guns without a second thought. When the Justice League from the original timeline arrived, Batman helped them escape from the authorities and learned of our timeline. He assisted them in breaking into the facility where the time portal was kept. However, Batman did not accompany the League into the past to thwart Savage, preferring to stay behind and lead the resistance in case they failed. It is assumed that this reality ceased to exist when the League defeated Savage and counteract the Axis powers\\' artificial advantages. Powers and Abilities Through his years of intensive physical training, the Batman represents the peak of human physical conditioning. Batman is at peak human levels of strength, stamina, agility, coordination, reflexes, speed, and durability. Even well into old age, Bruce Wayne still demonstrated that he could manhandle other much younger men with ease. Batman\\'s martial arts discipline was never mentioned, in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Bruce Wayne mentions Ju Jitsu. Batman was also a master of stealth and infiltration (all the more remarkable given that he stands 6\\'2\" and weighs 215 lbs), and often revealed himself to his enemies when they least suspected him to. This also allowed him to just disappear from allies in mid-sentence, a habit that frequently annoyed the likes of Commissioner Gordon (\"one of these days I\\'m gonna nail his feet to the ground\") and Harvey Bullock (\"I wonder how the Commish puts up with that\"). Batman was capable of incredible feats of agility. During the Second Apokolyptian invasion, Darkseid commented with much surprise that Batman had been the first one to dodge his Omega Beams. With his martial arts prowess, occasionally augmented by technology, Batman was usually more than a match for any foe he encountered, human or otherwise. Equipment As the head of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce Wayne has access to cutting edge technology and Batman makes good use of it in his field equipment. Batsuit-standard as well as heat-resistant, cold-resistant, and underwater versions. Batarangs-of differing size and effect. These ranged from standard, to explosive, electric, remote, etc. Grapple-gun. This item assisted Batman in scaling the various buildings of Gotham City. Utility Belt - Batman\\'s Utility Belt has compartments to hold several items, the contents of which change according to his needs, and often include items such as flashlights, laser cutters, underwater rebreathers, binoculars, a fingerprinting kit, flashbangs, remote controls for his vehicles, acid/base compounds, anti-toxins, mini-computer, and smoke pellets. Vehicles Batman has used several vehicles in the course of his crimefighting career, including: Batmobile Batwing Batcycle Batboat Appearances Batman: The Animated Series Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero The New Batman Adventures Superman: The Animated Series Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Batman Beyond Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Justice League Justice League Unlimited Static Shock'],\n",
      "    response='No, Batman does not have superpowers like invisibility or the ability to shoot webs from his hands. In the DC universe, Batman—whose real name is Bruce Wayne—is portrayed as a highly skilled human vigilante without any innate superhuman abilities. Instead, he relies on his exceptional training, intelligence, and technology to fight crime. For example, he achieves feats that might seem superhuman through peak physical condition (like expert martial arts and acrobatics), genius-level detective skills, and advanced gadgets from his utility belt, such as batarangs or smoke pellets.\\n\\nThis makes Batman unique compared to characters like Spider-Man, as his effectiveness comes from preparation, strategy, and human determination rather than biological enhancements. If you\\'re wondering how he pulls off incredible escapes or stealth, it\\'s all about his mastery of escapology, stealth techniques, and high-tech equipment—he\\'s often called the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" for a reason!\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to know more about his training, specific gadgets, or how he stacks up against other heroes, or even examples from his stories, just let me know—I\\'m here to help dive deeper!'\n",

The student's goal is to deepen knowledge of superhero lore, so I'll focus on key adversaries and their relationships to make the answer educational and engaging.

      "    cooperative_answer=\"Batman's biggest enemies are a rogues gallery of iconic villains from the DC Comics universe, each bringing their own unique threats and motivations that challenge his sense of justice. At the top of the list is his arch-nemesis, the Joker, a chaotic clown who embodies anarchy and has pushed Batman to his limits in countless stories with his unpredictable schemes and psychological warfare. Other major foes include Catwoman, a cunning anti-heroine with a complex romantic history with Batman; the Penguin, a crime lord with a penchant for elaborate gadgets and underworld dealings; Two-Face, once Bruce Wayne's friend Harvey Dent, whose split personality drives him to obsessive duality; Bane, a physically dominant brute who once broke Batman both mentally and physically; and Poison Ivy, an eco-terrorist with plant-based powers and a radical environmental agenda. These enemies not only represent different aspects of crime and villainy but also highlight Batman's internal conflicts, like his no-kill rule and moral boundaries. If you're diving into superhero lore, it's fascinating how these characters' backstories often tie into Batman's own history— for example, the Joker might stem from themes of madness, while Bane challenges Batman's physical prowess.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate .

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21. He has mastered Diverse Environmental Training, Security Systems, and illusion/sleight of hand by the time he was 23. He gained even more degrees in Biology, Physics, Advanced Chemistry, and Technology by the time he was 25. He has learned Forensic, Medical Sciences, Expanded Computer and Engineering Sciences, and Expanded Device Pool use of personal powered armor and system, database creation on underworld crime bosses, rogue\\'s gallery foes and other supers; improved material sciences for body armor and micro-machinery by the time he was 26. Has also learned Advanced New Development in Forensic and Medical Sciences. Master Tactician : He is a master strategist and tactician commonly utilizes extremely cunning tactics, strategies, and protocols to outwit his foes. He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture. Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced.

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision.

Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23.

Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them.

Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber.

He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition.

Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded.

Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally.

Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill.

Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed.

Batcycle Bat-Glider', 'The Batman General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne Aliases: The Batman The Dark Knight Portrayed by: Rino Romano Appearances: The Batman The Batman Strikes! The Batman vs. Dracula The Batman is a masked vigilante and the hero of Gotham City . Batman is the secret identity of billionaire Bruce Wayne , the CEO of Wayne Enterprises, who, after witnessing the death of his parents, vowed to spend the rest of his life warring on all criminals. He is a founding member of the Justice League . Contents 1 History 2 Appearance 3 Powers and Abilities 4 Paraphernalia 4.1 Equipment 4.2 Transportation 4.3 Weapons 4.4 Batsuits 5 Appearances 6 Trivia 7 Voiced by History Bruce Wayne was born a child of wealth and privilege to Thomas and Martha Wayne of Gotham City. As the Waynes\\' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father\\'s business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler, Alfred Pennyworth , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents\\' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City. As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named Ethan Bennett . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\". As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents\\' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot. For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman\\'s activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police Angel Rojas took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named Ellen Yin , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham. In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date – the Joker . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes. The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham\\'s underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named Bane . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of the Penguin , Man-Bat , Killer Croc , Cluemaster and Catwoman . One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce\\'s career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface. Some time later, a new character entered the Batman\\'s life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally. Barbara Gordon , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordan , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend Poison Ivy from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara\\'s aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt. The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist Dick Grayson was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named Tony Zucco . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick\\'s acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force. Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself John Jones . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called the Joining . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth\\'s atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John\\'s behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as Lex Luthor . At some point later, in the year 2027, Mr. Freeze had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named Nightwing . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever. One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave\\'s titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman\\'s legacy survived into the future.

His personal favourite was the Gray Ghost , watching the television show with his father. On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to Wonder Woman , Bruce hadn\\'t been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes\\' faithful friend and butler, Alfred Pennyworth Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from Yoru Sensei . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor\\'s daughter Zatanna became very close. As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with Andrea Beaumont . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\". War on Crime Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the Batcave . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city\\'s underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in Dick Grayson as his ward after witnessing his parents\\' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down their murderer . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and Commissioner James Gordon , working with them to control crime in Gotham. Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included the Penguin , Poison Ivy , Mr. Freeze and the Scarecrow . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including Catwoman and Two-Face . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered the Joker , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created. New Adventures Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as Batwoman . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called Batgirl began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father\\'s legacy as the next Police Commissioner. Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned Tim Drake from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder. Joining Up For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called Blüdhaven . Batman would later find himself in Metropolis , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with Lex Luthor , Batman would find himself working with Superman to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker\\'s plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue\\'s gallery. He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another\\'s home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity. Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper. It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world\\'s greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League. Saving the World Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech\\'s deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station\\'s antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J\\'onn J\\'onzz\\' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna\\'s destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch. Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman\\'s mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don\\'t even think about it\". When the Imperium\\'s attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation. Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J\\'onn J\\'onzz. After freeing J\\'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J\\'onn J\\'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of Wonder Woman . The Flash arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing\\'s severed wing. After J\\'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium\\'s invasion of Mars , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium\\'s factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun\\'s rays. The heroes split up to disable the factories. Batman went to Giza, Egypt with Wonder Woman and J\\'onn J\\'onzz. The trio infiltrated the factory and found the Ion Matrix Crystal, a vital component of the plant. Batman and Wonder Woman provided a diversion to allow J\\'onzz to remove the crystal. As he removed the crystal, J\\'onzz was incapacitated by Imperium forces. Batman then covered Wonder Woman and J\\'onzz\\' escape from the plant, but was himself trapped inside and cornered by Imperium forces. J\\'onzz reported that Batman was dead, but in truth, he had mentally shielded Batman to prevent the Imperium forces from detecting him. Batman remained hidden until the Imperium arrived on Earth. He then revealed himself and reversed the ion charge in the Ion Matrix Crystal, causing the plant to burn off the smoke it had been producing. With the sun shining again, the heroes defeated the Imperium and freed their human prisoners, then mopped up the remaining Imperium forces around the globe. Inspired by a general\\'s speech about vigilance and the possible return of the invaders, Batman had the Watchtower constructed by Wayne Enterprises, hiding the funding as a \"line item in the aerospace R&D budget\". Batman invited the other six heroes who had repelled the invaders to the station. The seven heroes formed the Justice League. Claiming he wasn\\'t a \"people person\", Batman did not officially join the League, though he did offer to be on call when the League needed his help. Long considered the brains of the League, Batman often found solutions that eluded the other members. He was quick to place himself in danger, despite the awe-inspiring powers of his teammates. During the Atlantis Usurpation, Batman put a stop to the melting of the Polar Ice Caps. On another occasion, Batman single-handedly defeated five dangerous criminals before being taken prisoner by an Amazon trained criminal. During his time with the League, Batman showed his distrust of Superman. After Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid and when Batman had to pull Superman back later when he attempted to end Darkseid\\'s life, Batman began carrying a piece of Kryptonite, which was revealed when the android Amazo copied Superman\\'s powers. However, Batman still held a deep respect for the Man of Steel, especially after he had seemingly died at the hands of Toyman. But, regardless of his respect, Batman remained stubborn in his disbelief in Superman\\'s death, and refused to mourn for him for quite a while. During the Thanagarian Invasion of Earth, Batman was forced to reveal his identity to his teammates. After successfully retaking the Watchtower from Thanagarian Forces, Batman piloted the Watchtower through the Earth\\'s atmosphere in an attempt to plunge it into a Hyperspace Bypass, a city-wide machine that would generate a wormhole through the Earth. As Batman lost consciousness due to the heat surrounding him, Superman rescued him and as the Watchtower destroyed the Bypass Generator. With the Watchtower\\'s destruction and Hawkgirl \\'s resignation from the League, Batman and the five other members reformed the Justice League with a new Watchtower and an expanded roster of heroes. Batman was instrumental in recruiting Green Arrow into the League, who along with other human league members, helped keep the League from becoming an autonomous Metahuman army. With Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, Batman fought Chronos across time, an adventure during which he met another Batman as well as his older self. He also succeeded in demonstrating to Amanda Waller that Cadmus was being used as a tool to further Lex Luthor\\'s personal agenda to discredit and destroy the Justice League. Amanda Waller was so impressed with Batman that she created Project Batman Beyond to ensure that the world would always have a Batman. Joker\\'s Final Joke After these events, Robin went missing for three weeks while on patrol, with Batman and Batgirl searching for him, until they learned he was at Arkham Asylum . They encounter Joker and Harley Quinn , who reveal that they adopted a son named J.J.(Joker, Jr.), who was actually Robin brainwashed and driven insane. Joker seems to escape, with Batman hot in pursuit. However, he was actually trying to lure Batman into Arkham\\'s Cineplex, where he reveals that he subjected Robin to countless amounts of psychological and physical tortures, and because of this, Joker now knows Batman\\'s true identity, and everything about him. Batman, enraged at the cruelty and torture Joker inflicted onto Robin, smashes through the theater box, and beats Joker down (wrecking the projector in the process, causing Joker to say \"If you don\\'t like the movie, I\\'ve got slides!\"), then hurls Joker down to the room that J.J.\\'s in. Batman threatens to break Joker in half, causing the Joker to retort that he would have done it years ago if he really wanted to do it. Suddenly, The Joker draws a switchblade, and slices Batman\\'s chest, as well as stabs his leg. He then gives what looks like a gun to J.J. and tells him to kill Batman (or, in his words, \"deliver the punchline.\"). J.J. then pulls the trigger, revealing the gun to actually be the infamous \"Bang!\" flag spear gun that is one of the Joker\\'s trademark weapons. J.J. apparently hesitates to kill Batman, causing the Joker to shout \"DO IT!\". Tim reluctantly obliges. Instead of killing Batman however, he instead turns it away at the last second, thus shooting the Joker instead, killing him. J.J. half laughs and half sobs at the events, and Batgirl (having arrived after her fight with Harley Quinn) tries to console him. Commissioner Gordon and Batman later bury the body of Joker in the ruins of Arkham, and Tim is taken to Doctor Leslie Thompkins for rehabilitation. After these events, Batman forbade Tim Drake from ever becoming Robin again. Tim attempted to go solo for a few years, but in the end quit the super-hero life, got married and had children. He broke off contact with Bruce but remained close with Barbara and perhaps Dick. Also, as a result of the fight, Batman walked with a slight limp which in his later years would force him to walk with a cane. Late Adventures Many years passed following the attack of the Joker on the Bat-Family, Bruce entered middle age and began to suffer with a bad heart from the effects of a hard life of crime fighting. Batman developed a powered high tech suit (which had longer Bat ears and minus a cape) that augmented his physical abilities and allowed him to continue the never-ending battle for a few more years. At this time, his corporate rivalry with Derek Powers began, and Wayne Enterprises resisted a hostile bid for corporate takeover. However, injuries suffered through the long decades of physical punishment and an ailing heart finally took their toll, and even the suit couldn\\'t compensate any longer. While attempting to rescue his old friend Veronica Vreeland\\'s daughter Bunny Vreeland from kidnappers, Batman managed to subdue the kidnappers with limited effort until he was forced to point a gun at a common thug to save Ms. Vreeland and his own life after suffering a heart attack while in the midst of the fight. Injured, Batman limps outside the hangar, removing his mask upon realizing he was wielding a handgun, forced to rely on the weapon of his parents\\' cowardly murderer to defend himself against criminals. Ashamed, Bruce returns to the Batcave, where he places the Batsuit in the costume display gallery. Walking to the top of the stairs, Bruce takes one last look at the Batcave and solemnly vows, \"Never again.\" Vowing to never again wear the cowl, Bruce then shuts off the lights, and leaves his past in the darkness. Passing the Mantle of the Bat When he hung up the mantle of the bat, Bruce came a recluse, shut off in Wayne Manor with his dog, Ace. He withdrew from the day to day operations of Wayne Enterprises, a decision that left the company vulnerable to a takeover by Derek Powers and caused Wayne much regret. It was now the year 2039 and Bruce Wayne had become a very old man. Chance brought teen-aged Terry McGinnis to the gates of Wayne Manor, where he learned of Bruce\\'s past secret life. After McGinnis suffered the loss of his father, Bruce reluctantly agreed to allow him to take up mantle of Batman. Bruce then served as a mentor and informant for the successor to his legacy. For years, Bruce coordinated with Terry, supplying advice and direction from the Batcave while McGinnis worked in the field. He also ran the labs and developed new gadgets for Terry to use in the new crusade against crime. The elderly Bruce Wayne occasionally ventured into the field to support Terry. His sense of duty and self-sacrifice ever present, he once donned a suit of Batman armor to rescue Terry from the villain Inque, despite Inque\\'s Metahuman power and the strain produced on Bruce\\'s already damaged heart. As Bruce continued to age, he suffered a kidney failure. When it was discovered that Terry was not just a suitable donor but a perfect one, their relationship reached its weakest point; Terry, like Dick Grayson before him, felt betrayed, manipulated, and outright used. He set off to uncover the truth from someone willing to reveal it. Terry confronted Amanda Waller and learned the truth about his heritage. In her earlier years, Waller realized the world would always need a Batman. Taking fate into her own hands (unbeknownst to Bruce), she gathered a sample of Bruce Wayne\\'s genetic material, after a battle that left Batman in need of medical attention. Using her Cadmus connections, Waller implanted this genetic material into a young Warren McGinnis, replacing his genetic material with Bruce\\'s. Thus, Terry McGinnis was born, the son of Bruce Wayne, sharing half his genetic code. Terry returned to Wayne Manor with a new sense of purpose. Bruce wondered about the fate of Gotham, and Terry replied \"I\\'ve got it covered. Always.\" Their relationship repaired; Bruce had truly become the father Terry had lost long ago. The Savage Timeline In an alternate timeline created by Vandal Savage, the Axis forces won World War II. There, Bruce Wayne lost his parents when they spoke out against the regime and became Batman to fight Savage and his forces. He served as the leader of the resistance movement, recruiting other victims. Unlike his original self, Batman was willing to use guns without a second thought. When the Justice League from the original timeline arrived, Batman helped them escape from the authorities and learned of our timeline. He assisted them in breaking into the facility where the time portal was kept. However, Batman did not accompany the League into the past to thwart Savage, preferring to stay behind and lead the resistance in case they failed. It is assumed that this reality ceased to exist when the League defeated Savage and counteract the Axis powers\\' artificial advantages. Powers and Abilities Through his years of intensive physical training, the Batman represents the peak of human physical conditioning. Batman is at peak human levels of strength, stamina, agility, coordination, reflexes, speed, and durability. Even well into old age, Bruce Wayne still demonstrated that he could manhandle other much younger men with ease. Batman\\'s martial arts discipline was never mentioned, in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Bruce Wayne mentions Ju Jitsu. Batman was also a master of stealth and infiltration (all the more remarkable given that he stands 6\\'2\" and weighs 215 lbs), and often revealed himself to his enemies when they least suspected him to. This also allowed him to just disappear from allies in mid-sentence, a habit that frequently annoyed the likes of Commissioner Gordon (\"one of these days I\\'m gonna nail his feet to the ground\") and Harvey Bullock (\"I wonder how the Commish puts up with that\"). Batman was capable of incredible feats of agility. During the Second Apokolyptian invasion, Darkseid commented with much surprise that Batman had been the first one to dodge his Omega Beams. With his martial arts prowess, occasionally augmented by technology, Batman was usually more than a match for any foe he encountered, human or otherwise. Equipment As the head of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce Wayne has access to cutting edge technology and Batman makes good use of it in his field equipment. Batsuit-standard as well as heat-resistant, cold-resistant, and underwater versions. Batarangs-of differing size and effect. These ranged from standard, to explosive, electric, remote, etc. Grapple-gun. This item assisted Batman in scaling the various buildings of Gotham City. Utility Belt - Batman\\'s Utility Belt has compartments to hold several items, the contents of which change according to his needs, and often include items such as flashlights, laser cutters, underwater rebreathers, binoculars, a fingerprinting kit, flashbangs, remote controls for his vehicles, acid/base compounds, anti-toxins, mini-computer, and smoke pellets. Vehicles Batman has used several vehicles in the course of his crimefighting career, including: Batmobile Batwing Batcycle Batboat Appearances Batman: The Animated Series Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero The New Batman Adventures Superman: The Animated Series Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Batman Beyond Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Justice League Justice League Unlimited Static Shock'],\n",
      "    response=\"Batman's biggest enemies are a rogues gallery of iconic villains from the DC Comics universe, each bringing their own unique threats and motivations that challenge his sense of justice. At the top of the list is his arch-nemesis, the Joker, a chaotic clown who embodies anarchy and has pushed Batman to his limits in countless stories with his unpredictable schemes and psychological warfare. Other major foes include Catwoman, a cunning anti-heroine with a complex romantic history with Batman; the Penguin, a crime lord with a penchant for elaborate gadgets and underworld dealings; Two-Face, once Bruce Wayne's friend Harvey Dent, whose split personality drives him to obsessive duality; Bane, a physically dominant brute who once broke Batman both mentally and physically; and Poison Ivy, an eco-terrorist with plant-based powers and a radical environmental agenda. These enemies not only represent different aspects of crime and villainy but also highlight Batman's internal conflicts, like his no-kill rule and moral boundaries. If you're diving into superhero lore, it's fascinating how these characters' backstories often tie into Batman's own history— for example, the Joker might stem from themes of madness, while Bane challenges Batman's physical prowess.

As the Waynes\\' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father\\'s business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler, Alfred Pennyworth , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents\\' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City. As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named Ethan Bennett . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\". As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents\\' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot. For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman\\'s activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police Angel Rojas took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named Ellen Yin , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham. In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date – the Joker . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes. The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham\\'s underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named Bane . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of the Penguin , Man-Bat , Killer Croc , Cluemaster and Catwoman . One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce\\'s career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface. Some time later, a new character entered the Batman\\'s life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally. Barbara Gordon , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordan , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend Poison Ivy from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara\\'s aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt. The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist Dick Grayson was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named Tony Zucco . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick\\'s acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force. Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself John Jones . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called the Joining . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth\\'s atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John\\'s behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as Lex Luthor . At some point later, in the year 2027, Mr. Freeze had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named Nightwing . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever. One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave\\'s titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman\\'s legacy survived into the future.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded.

Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill.

This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced.

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running.

He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations.

He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone.

His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory.

Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber.

Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition.

This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker.

The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons.

Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas.

Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced. He has completely mastered all unarmed hand-to hand combat styles of martial arts including but not limited to MMA, Muay Thai , Escrima , Krav Maga , Capoeira , Savate , Yawyan , Taekwondo , Judo , Jui-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Ninjutsu , Kendo , Fencing , Kenjutsu , , Bojutsu , Wrestling , , Boxing , Kickboxing , Hapkido , Sambo , Wing Chun , Parkour , Shorin Ryu , Silat , Chin Na , Kyudo , Aikido , Varma Ati , Jeet Kune Do , Shaolin , Ba Gua , Hung Gar , Tai Chi , Kung Fu , Kenpo , and Karate . His primary form of combat is a harmonious mixture of Jui-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Judo, Muay Thai, Savate, Karate, Kung Fu, Boxing, Capoeira, Krav Maga, Aikido, and Ninjutsu. Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running. He can perform impeccably precise acrobatic moves instinctively in combat, or whilst escaping a catastrophe, and can even dodge a superhuman individual\\'s blows and sword-swings. He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations. His current aliases are: Matches Malone, Thomas Quigley, Ragman, Detective Hawke, Sir Hemingford Grey, Lester Krutz, Frank Dixon, Gordon Selkirk, and Mr. Fledermaus. Master Escapologist : He has been described as second only to Mister Miracle as an escape artist. He has been seen escaping from a Posey straitjacket in less than 52 seconds, and remarked afterwards that the time was way too slow for him. He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21.

He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture.

Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

      "    context=['Class 3 DC Comics Years 2011 – present Subtheme of Super Heroes Related themes Batman Marvel Ultrabuild Hero Factory BIONICLE LEGO Dimensions DC Comics , previously known as DC Universe , is a subtheme of Super Heroes introduced in December 2011 . Preview edition Batman and Green Lantern minifigures were given away at the 2011 San-Diego Comic Con. In addition to Batman and Green Lantern, Superman was also given out at the New York City Comic-Con. Contents 1 Description 1.1 Ultrabuilds 2 Background 3 Products 3.1 Comic-Con and DC FanDome Exclusives 3.2 Polybags 3.3 Sets 3.4 Ultrabuild sets 3.5 Duplo Combination models 3.6 Video Games 3.7 Movies 3.8 Board Game 3.9 Magnets 3.10 Key Chains 3.11 Books 4 Notes 5 Minifigures 5.1 Non-physical characters 7 Videos 8 Sources Description Sets in the DC Comics theme mostly revolve around Batman and his rogues gallery, but other heroes such as Superman , Wonder Woman , Aquaman , Flash and Green Lantern have appeared, although only Superman actually has some foes from his series that appears in a box set ( Lex Luthor , Brainiac , Darkseid , Bizarro and General Zod ). However, in 2015, Lego started making sets for heroes besides Batman and Superman. Currently, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Aquaman, and Flash are the only heroes who have had their enemies appear in sets. Most of the sets are very similar to sets from the previous Batman theme, but are now fully comic-based and have a more colorful and cartoony approach to the source material, as opposed to the darker colors used in the original theme, which was mostly based on Batman: The Animated Series . Many of the minifigures from the original theme which were based on their animated series counterparts (such as The Joker , Harley Quinn , Poison Ivy , and Two-Face ), and have been changed to resemble a comic-inspired iteration. Characters who already were based on the comic books (such as Catwoman , Bane , and The Riddler ) have changed the least, only being updated with new prints, and colors (and in Riddler\\'s case, a new mould, the Small Clown \\'s bowler hat). Most characters color schemes have remained the same, except for Two-Face\\'s, which has drastically changed from white and black to orange and purple. Batman\\'s vehicles frequently use black and yellow where the original ones would use black and gold; he also occasionally uses a light grey and dark blue colored vehicle. While in the original Batman sets, many villains would carry guns, most of the villains in DC Universe don\\'t have guns at all, the exception being The Joker who even then has his false \"BANG\" gun. While many of the structures in Batman would use dark colours like grey, black, and brown, the three structures released in DC Universe : Joker, Riddler, and Harley Quinn\\'s funhouse , a bank , and The Batcave , are generally more colourful; The Funhouse mixes the color schemes of all three villains included together (this includes colors such as black, red, white, purple, green, and yellow), and the Batcave uses both of the color schemes Batman has used on his vehicles throughout the first wave (black and yellow and dark blue and grey), and adds transparent light blue lights. So far, several System sets revolving around a hero other than Batman has been released. 76002 Superman: Metropolis Showdown , 76003 Superman: Battle of Smallville , and 76009 Superman: Black Zero Escape are based on the film Man of Steel . 6862 Superman vs. Power Armour Lex depicts Superman fighting a large, purple and green, kryptonite-powered mech piloted by his arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor, while trying to rescue Wonder Woman.

In 2013, a set inspired by The Dark Knight Rises was released. It includes Batman , Bane , and Commissioner Gordon inspired by their appearances in The Dark Knight trilogy. Also included is The Bat, which is black with blue highlights, a redesigned Tumbler in a desert camouflage color scheme and smaller than the original, and two yellow and black barricades. 10937 Batman: Arkham Asylum Breakout , features a new model of Arkham Asylum, which featured dark colors such as dark grey, black, and dark red.

The Scarecrow and Mr. Freeze , who were based on their appearances on Batman:The Animated Series , are updated with new prints and colors, with Freeze having a new helmet and gun design.

These sets introduced new characters Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, Katana, Killer Moth, and Blue Beetle, along with Ras Al Ghul, and Talia Al Ghul. Updated variants of Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Damien Wayne and Scarecrow were also introduced. In March, a direct to consumer exclusive version of the Batcave from the 1966 TV series was released, featuring nine minifigures based off their interpretations on the show. In 2017, due to the release of The LEGO Batman Movie , no regular release sets were launched in January under the main DC theme, except for three Mighty Micros sets. Four sets were released in the summer wave, with three being tie-ins for the Justice League movie. A Wonder Woman movie set was also released. In 2018, three Justice League comic sets were released in January featuring updated versions of Batman, Superman, The Flash, Wonder Woman, Lex Luthor, and Cyborg. These sets also introduced six new characters, Cheetah, Lobo, Firestorm, Krypto, Killer Frost, and the Reverse-Flash. In the summer, three comic based Batman sets were released. These sets featured new variants of Batman, as well as new characters Batwoman, Ace the Bathound, Brother Eye, and OMAC, along with Court of Owls Talons. Three more Mighty Micros sets were also released this year, along with a Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice inspired blister pack, the latter featuring the exclusive Knightmare Batman variant. In winter 2019, two more sets were released both depicting Batman and a member of the Justice League battling one or more villains. New to the line with this wave, was Ocean Master and Firefly . The wave also introduced updated variants of Batman , The Flash , Poison Ivy , and Aquaman , A summer wave was also released to celebrate Batman\\'s eightieth anniversary, with redesigned versions of The Batcave , Batmobile , Batwing , and Batcycle , as well as updated variants of Batman, Bruce Wayne, Robin, Mr. Freeze, The Joker, Two-Face, Catwoman, Harley Quinn, The Riddler, Commissioner Gordon, and Clayface. In the fall, an 3,306 pieced version of the 1989 Batmobile was released, along with a minifigure scale version . The big version featured exclusive variants of The Joker, and Vicki Vale from the movie, as well as Batman, the latter who was released again the following year, in 76161 1989 Batwing. In 2020, a collectable minifigure series was released. The latter half of the year saw four more sets released with Batman, with the largest being the 1989 Batwing . The summer wave featured updated versions of Man-Bat, Mr. Freeze, Nightwing, Robin, Harley Quinn, Batgirl, and The Penguin, with one new character, Bronze Tiger , also introduced. In the 1989 Batwing , an updated variant of the 1989 Joker was also released, along with Lawrence the Boombox Goon. A set tied to the release of Wonder Woman 1984 was also released. In 2021 the DC theme was light with minimal sets released. In January, a blister pack featuring Batman, The Penguin, and Harley Quinn was released. Batman\\'s variant was a redesigned version of his grey suit from 2006. The spring wave saw a redesigned 1966 Batmobile released, with updated Batman and The Joker minifigures, along with a Juniors set, featuring Batman, The Joker, and Batgirl. A Batman cowl statue was also released. In the fall, a minifigure scale version of the Dark Knight Trilogy Tumbler launched, with a redesigned Ultimate Collector Series version set for release in November. Three sets for The Batman , were also set for a spring release, but pushed to the fall, with their release set for November 2021 in North America, and January 2022 worldwide. Ultrabuilds The Ultrabuilds are constructable action figures based on a ball-and-socket building system. All of the figures are made of a black and grey TECHNIC-like skeleton, with armor of varying colors placed upon it, although they all feature unique, semi-realistic head moulds. They are built similarly to recent Hero Factory sets. All of the Ultrabuild figures have two friction joints, which do not appear in similarly sized Hero Factory sets, an exclusive head, and all feature either a printed chest or torso piece. Three DC Ultrabuilds have been released to date based on Batman , The Joker , and strangely, Green Lantern who had yet to appear in a system set at that point. The Ultrabuild figures utilize different colour schemes than their respective minifigures, and also have different weapons. Batman is depicted as wearing blue boots, a blue cowl, blue sleeves, and blue over his chest, while everything else is gunmetal in colour, with the exception of his \"cape\" which is made of two long, curved pieces on either side of his back. Batman carries a sword, while in the sets he generally carries a batarang. Green Lantern, who has only been promotionally released in his movie based costume, has bright green boots, shoulder pads, and chest, while his upper legs and lower torso are gunmetal, and his arms are gunmetal and white. Unlike his minifigure, who had no accessories in the promotion, Green Lantern wields a construct which takes the form of a morning-star weapon. The Joker is the most drastically different from his minifigure, who mostly wears purple. As an Ultrabuild, however, he wears little purple, only having it on his shoulders, coat tails, lower arms, and lower legs. His other parts are a large variety of colors including gunmetal, bright green, and orange. He also carries a ray gun which uses colours such as transparent orange, white, and transparent neon green. Background The DC Universe subtheme\\'s continuity is based on no particular DC continuity, but instead follows the original one used in the Batman theme, which is based on the comic books and the DC Animated Universe . So far, the story has mostly been told through the comic books included in the DC sets. In the first comic, The Joker and Harley Quinn team up with The Riddler , and capture Robin . They hang him over a barrel of a green substance until Batman arrives and triggers the traps at their hideout, using them against the villains. Batman then rescues Robin, and the three villains then escape on the roller coaster, leaving the ending open for play opportunities. In the second, Catwoman steals a diamond and Batman gives chase to her. The third issue depicts Batman and Robin capturing Poison Ivy , and bringing her back to The Batcave . Bane then enters on his drill to rescue Ivy. Bruce Wayne quickly changes into Batman, and uses the Batcycle to fight Bane\\'s drill, before it is left at a cliff-hanger. In the fourth, Lex Luthor has captured Wonder Woman and Superman proceeds to save her. Lex\\'s mech is destroyed, but he escapes. Wonder Woman is then shown posed heroically, swinging her lasso, again leaving the end open. In the next comic, The Joker returns, this time in his helicopter and with a henchman . He tries to drop a laughing gas bomb on Gotham City, but the Batwing almost destroys his helicopter. The Joker and the henchman are shown grasping on to the rotor, once again leaving the end open. In the final comic, Two-Face is robbing a bank. Batman gives chase to him in the Batmobile, at which point the comic ends openly again. In a three-part story in LEGO Magazine and on LEGO.com , Batcave Break-in , Lex Luthor creates the Injustice Gang, a team composed of himself, The Joker, Catwoman, Bane, Poison Ivy, and Two-Face. They manage to find the Batcave and defeat Batman and Robin, but fail to decide who gets to have their revenge first, which causes them to fight amongst themselves, and allows Batman and Robin to escape and capture them all at once. Strangely, Mr. Freeze and Harley Quinn appear on the cover of the first part of Batcave Break-in , but don\\'t appear in the story. Mr. Freeze did not even appear in any of the Super Heroes sets at the time. A sequel to LEGO Batman: The Videogame has been released. It revolves around The Joker teaming up with Lex Luthor to get his revenge on Batman. The Justice League come to his aid in his hour of need. See LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes for more information. A LEGO Batman Short aired on DC Nation in March 2012 . In it, Batman and Robin are chasing The Joker, who has stolen the Man of the Year award, which was supposed to be awarded to Bruce Wayne . The Joker is caught and sent to Arkham Asylum, a defeat which Lois Lane is shown reporting. Lex Luthor then arrives and frees Joker (and The Penguin when he was demonstrating his gun) from his cell, and they form a partnership. The short is directly related to LEGO Batman 2 and clips from it have appeared in various trailers and other advertisements. In the winter 2013, one comic was released featuring all three sets. Dr. Harleen Quinzel (as Harley Quinn) with the help of The Penguin breaks The Joker, Mr. Freeze , The Scarecrow , and Poison Ivy out of Arkham Asylum , while Batman arrives to stop it, but is frozen by Freeze. The other villians leave Freeze behind, and Robin arrives and beats Freeze while Batman subdues the other villians. Aquaman talks with a whale before arriving on a dock and frozen by Mr. Freeze with Batman coming to his rescue in the Batboat. Batman in The Bat and Commissioner Gordon work to stop Bane in a camo Tumbler and are successful. In spring, 2014, another comic was released depicting the four sets released in that era. It starts with the Penguin stealing a precious jewel, and escapes on his duck boat, with scuba Batman in hot pursuit. Batman makes quick work of the Penguin, but the explosion sends the gem into the air, where Man-Bat takes it. Nightwing arrives on the scene with his glider-jet, which is broken by Man-Bat, but Batman saves him and defeats the villain in the Batcopter. But the gem falls once more, into the bag of The Riddler , who has gotten away with money after a recent robbery. The Flash goes after him, but The Riddler defeats him with his banana. However, due to moving at such high speeds, The Riddler loses all of his money and the gem, which The Flash recovers. Batman comes in on the Batmobile, and after narrowly dodging The Riddler\\'s bomb, hits one of his wheels. Batman and The Flash tie up The Riddler, and The Flash returns the money to the bank. However, The Riddler and Batman notice a disturbance, which is The Joker\\'s steamroller, which wrecks havoc on Gotham City and its people. Robin manages to defeat his goon, but The Joker swerves, knocking both of them off the vehicle, but Batgirl saves Robin. Batman arrives in the Batwing, but his flick fire missiles are deflected by the Steamroller. Thinking outside of the box, Batman closes in the wings, and manages to capture The Joker. From 2014, year-long story arcs would be published throughout each issue of the LEGO Club Magazine and on the LEGO Club website, using Club Codes. The 2014 story arc was entitled \"Fearless\". It is a story featuring the Justice League in a battle against the Scarecrow and the Ventriloquist. In 2015, the story was entitled \"False Victory\". It is based on the 2015 line of sets. The main antagonist is Darkseid. The comic was available at San Diego Comic-Con 2015, with an Action Comics #1 poster inside. The 2016 story arc followed Batman\\'s villains (with the inclusion of Lex Luthor) as they told tales of how close they had come to defeating Batman. A new instalment was released each LEGO Club issue, and the conclusion was available exclusively on LEGOClub.com. The SDCC print edition was released with a Mighty Micros comic, which had been released in two instalments on the LEGO Club website. The comic\\'s main antagonist was Mr. Mxyzptlk . Occasionally, a new LEGO DC comic based on the current line of sets is released in the LEGO Life Magazine .

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill.

Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang.

He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23.

For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer.

Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition.

Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker.

The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers .

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated .

Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush .

Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced.

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen. Master Acrobat : Proficient in gymnastics and acrobatics, to the peak of human ability. He is particularly skilled in parkour and free running.

He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23.

He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone.

Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber.

He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition.

He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations.

His personal favourite was the Gray Ghost , watching the television show with his father. On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to Wonder Woman , Bruce hadn\\'t been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes\\' faithful friend and butler, Alfred Pennyworth Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from Yoru Sensei . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor\\'s daughter Zatanna became very close. As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with Andrea Beaumont . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\". War on Crime Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the Batcave . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city\\'s underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in Dick Grayson as his ward after witnessing his parents\\' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down their murderer . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and Commissioner James Gordon , working with them to control crime in Gotham. Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included the Penguin , Poison Ivy , Mr. Freeze and the Scarecrow . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including Catwoman and Two-Face . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered the Joker , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created. New Adventures Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as Batwoman . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called Batgirl began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father\\'s legacy as the next Police Commissioner. Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned Tim Drake from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder. Joining Up For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called Blüdhaven . Batman would later find himself in Metropolis , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with Lex Luthor , Batman would find himself working with Superman to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker\\'s plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue\\'s gallery. He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another\\'s home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity. Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper. It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world\\'s greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League. Saving the World Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech\\'s deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station\\'s antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J\\'onn J\\'onzz\\' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna\\'s destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch. Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman\\'s mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don\\'t even think about it\". When the Imperium\\'s attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation. Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J\\'onn J\\'onzz. After freeing J\\'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J\\'onn J\\'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of Wonder Woman . The Flash arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing\\'s severed wing. After J\\'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium\\'s invasion of Mars , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium\\'s factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun\\'s rays. The heroes split up to disable the factories. Batman went to Giza, Egypt with Wonder Woman and J\\'onn J\\'onzz. The trio infiltrated the factory and found the Ion Matrix Crystal, a vital component of the plant. Batman and Wonder Woman provided a diversion to allow J\\'onzz to remove the crystal. As he removed the crystal, J\\'onzz was incapacitated by Imperium forces. Batman then covered Wonder Woman and J\\'onzz\\' escape from the plant, but was himself trapped inside and cornered by Imperium forces. J\\'onzz reported that Batman was dead, but in truth, he had mentally shielded Batman to prevent the Imperium forces from detecting him. Batman remained hidden until the Imperium arrived on Earth. He then revealed himself and reversed the ion charge in the Ion Matrix Crystal, causing the plant to burn off the smoke it had been producing. With the sun shining again, the heroes defeated the Imperium and freed their human prisoners, then mopped up the remaining Imperium forces around the globe. Inspired by a general\\'s speech about vigilance and the possible return of the invaders, Batman had the Watchtower constructed by Wayne Enterprises, hiding the funding as a \"line item in the aerospace R&D budget\". Batman invited the other six heroes who had repelled the invaders to the station. The seven heroes formed the Justice League. Claiming he wasn\\'t a \"people person\", Batman did not officially join the League, though he did offer to be on call when the League needed his help. Long considered the brains of the League, Batman often found solutions that eluded the other members. He was quick to place himself in danger, despite the awe-inspiring powers of his teammates. During the Atlantis Usurpation, Batman put a stop to the melting of the Polar Ice Caps. On another occasion, Batman single-handedly defeated five dangerous criminals before being taken prisoner by an Amazon trained criminal. During his time with the League, Batman showed his distrust of Superman. After Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid and when Batman had to pull Superman back later when he attempted to end Darkseid\\'s life, Batman began carrying a piece of Kryptonite, which was revealed when the android Amazo copied Superman\\'s powers. However, Batman still held a deep respect for the Man of Steel, especially after he had seemingly died at the hands of Toyman. But, regardless of his respect, Batman remained stubborn in his disbelief in Superman\\'s death, and refused to mourn for him for quite a while. During the Thanagarian Invasion of Earth, Batman was forced to reveal his identity to his teammates. After successfully retaking the Watchtower from Thanagarian Forces, Batman piloted the Watchtower through the Earth\\'s atmosphere in an attempt to plunge it into a Hyperspace Bypass, a city-wide machine that would generate a wormhole through the Earth. As Batman lost consciousness due to the heat surrounding him, Superman rescued him and as the Watchtower destroyed the Bypass Generator. With the Watchtower\\'s destruction and Hawkgirl \\'s resignation from the League, Batman and the five other members reformed the Justice League with a new Watchtower and an expanded roster of heroes. Batman was instrumental in recruiting Green Arrow into the League, who along with other human league members, helped keep the League from becoming an autonomous Metahuman army. With Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, Batman fought Chronos across time, an adventure during which he met another Batman as well as his older self. He also succeeded in demonstrating to Amanda Waller that Cadmus was being used as a tool to further Lex Luthor\\'s personal agenda to discredit and destroy the Justice League. Amanda Waller was so impressed with Batman that she created Project Batman Beyond to ensure that the world would always have a Batman. Joker\\'s Final Joke After these events, Robin went missing for three weeks while on patrol, with Batman and Batgirl searching for him, until they learned he was at Arkham Asylum . They encounter Joker and Harley Quinn , who reveal that they adopted a son named J.J.(Joker, Jr.), who was actually Robin brainwashed and driven insane. Joker seems to escape, with Batman hot in pursuit. However, he was actually trying to lure Batman into Arkham\\'s Cineplex, where he reveals that he subjected Robin to countless amounts of psychological and physical tortures, and because of this, Joker now knows Batman\\'s true identity, and everything about him. Batman, enraged at the cruelty and torture Joker inflicted onto Robin, smashes through the theater box, and beats Joker down (wrecking the projector in the process, causing Joker to say \"If you don\\'t like the movie, I\\'ve got slides!\"), then hurls Joker down to the room that J.J.\\'s in. Batman threatens to break Joker in half, causing the Joker to retort that he would have done it years ago if he really wanted to do it. Suddenly, The Joker draws a switchblade, and slices Batman\\'s chest, as well as stabs his leg. He then gives what looks like a gun to J.J. and tells him to kill Batman (or, in his words, \"deliver the punchline.\"). J.J. then pulls the trigger, revealing the gun to actually be the infamous \"Bang!\" flag spear gun that is one of the Joker\\'s trademark weapons. J.J. apparently hesitates to kill Batman, causing the Joker to shout \"DO IT!\". Tim reluctantly obliges. Instead of killing Batman however, he instead turns it away at the last second, thus shooting the Joker instead, killing him. J.J. half laughs and half sobs at the events, and Batgirl (having arrived after her fight with Harley Quinn) tries to console him. Commissioner Gordon and Batman later bury the body of Joker in the ruins of Arkham, and Tim is taken to Doctor Leslie Thompkins for rehabilitation. After these events, Batman forbade Tim Drake from ever becoming Robin again. Tim attempted to go solo for a few years, but in the end quit the super-hero life, got married and had children. He broke off contact with Bruce but remained close with Barbara and perhaps Dick. Also, as a result of the fight, Batman walked with a slight limp which in his later years would force him to walk with a cane. Late Adventures Many years passed following the attack of the Joker on the Bat-Family, Bruce entered middle age and began to suffer with a bad heart from the effects of a hard life of crime fighting. Batman developed a powered high tech suit (which had longer Bat ears and minus a cape) that augmented his physical abilities and allowed him to continue the never-ending battle for a few more years. At this time, his corporate rivalry with Derek Powers began, and Wayne Enterprises resisted a hostile bid for corporate takeover. However, injuries suffered through the long decades of physical punishment and an ailing heart finally took their toll, and even the suit couldn\\'t compensate any longer. While attempting to rescue his old friend Veronica Vreeland\\'s daughter Bunny Vreeland from kidnappers, Batman managed to subdue the kidnappers with limited effort until he was forced to point a gun at a common thug to save Ms. Vreeland and his own life after suffering a heart attack while in the midst of the fight. Injured, Batman limps outside the hangar, removing his mask upon realizing he was wielding a handgun, forced to rely on the weapon of his parents\\' cowardly murderer to defend himself against criminals. Ashamed, Bruce returns to the Batcave, where he places the Batsuit in the costume display gallery. Walking to the top of the stairs, Bruce takes one last look at the Batcave and solemnly vows, \"Never again.\" Vowing to never again wear the cowl, Bruce then shuts off the lights, and leaves his past in the darkness. Passing the Mantle of the Bat When he hung up the mantle of the bat, Bruce came a recluse, shut off in Wayne Manor with his dog, Ace. He withdrew from the day to day operations of Wayne Enterprises, a decision that left the company vulnerable to a takeover by Derek Powers and caused Wayne much regret. It was now the year 2039 and Bruce Wayne had become a very old man. Chance brought teen-aged Terry McGinnis to the gates of Wayne Manor, where he learned of Bruce\\'s past secret life. After McGinnis suffered the loss of his father, Bruce reluctantly agreed to allow him to take up mantle of Batman. Bruce then served as a mentor and informant for the successor to his legacy. For years, Bruce coordinated with Terry, supplying advice and direction from the Batcave while McGinnis worked in the field. He also ran the labs and developed new gadgets for Terry to use in the new crusade against crime. The elderly Bruce Wayne occasionally ventured into the field to support Terry. His sense of duty and self-sacrifice ever present, he once donned a suit of Batman armor to rescue Terry from the villain Inque, despite Inque\\'s Metahuman power and the strain produced on Bruce\\'s already damaged heart. As Bruce continued to age, he suffered a kidney failure. When it was discovered that Terry was not just a suitable donor but a perfect one, their relationship reached its weakest point; Terry, like Dick Grayson before him, felt betrayed, manipulated, and outright used. He set off to uncover the truth from someone willing to reveal it. Terry confronted Amanda Waller and learned the truth about his heritage. In her earlier years, Waller realized the world would always need a Batman. Taking fate into her own hands (unbeknownst to Bruce), she gathered a sample of Bruce Wayne\\'s genetic material, after a battle that left Batman in need of medical attention. Using her Cadmus connections, Waller implanted this genetic material into a young Warren McGinnis, replacing his genetic material with Bruce\\'s. Thus, Terry McGinnis was born, the son of Bruce Wayne, sharing half his genetic code. Terry returned to Wayne Manor with a new sense of purpose. Bruce wondered about the fate of Gotham, and Terry replied \"I\\'ve got it covered. Always.\" Their relationship repaired; Bruce had truly become the father Terry had lost long ago. The Savage Timeline In an alternate timeline created by Vandal Savage, the Axis forces won World War II. There, Bruce Wayne lost his parents when they spoke out against the regime and became Batman to fight Savage and his forces. He served as the leader of the resistance movement, recruiting other victims. Unlike his original self, Batman was willing to use guns without a second thought. When the Justice League from the original timeline arrived, Batman helped them escape from the authorities and learned of our timeline. He assisted them in breaking into the facility where the time portal was kept. However, Batman did not accompany the League into the past to thwart Savage, preferring to stay behind and lead the resistance in case they failed. It is assumed that this reality ceased to exist when the League defeated Savage and counteract the Axis powers\\' artificial advantages. Powers and Abilities Through his years of intensive physical training, the Batman represents the peak of human physical conditioning. Batman is at peak human levels of strength, stamina, agility, coordination, reflexes, speed, and durability. Even well into old age, Bruce Wayne still demonstrated that he could manhandle other much younger men with ease. Batman\\'s martial arts discipline was never mentioned, in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Bruce Wayne mentions Ju Jitsu. Batman was also a master of stealth and infiltration (all the more remarkable given that he stands 6\\'2\" and weighs 215 lbs), and often revealed himself to his enemies when they least suspected him to. This also allowed him to just disappear from allies in mid-sentence, a habit that frequently annoyed the likes of Commissioner Gordon (\"one of these days I\\'m gonna nail his feet to the ground\") and Harvey Bullock (\"I wonder how the Commish puts up with that\"). Batman was capable of incredible feats of agility. During the Second Apokolyptian invasion, Darkseid commented with much surprise that Batman had been the first one to dodge his Omega Beams. With his martial arts prowess, occasionally augmented by technology, Batman was usually more than a match for any foe he encountered, human or otherwise. Equipment As the head of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce Wayne has access to cutting edge technology and Batman makes good use of it in his field equipment. Batsuit-standard as well as heat-resistant, cold-resistant, and underwater versions. Batarangs-of differing size and effect. These ranged from standard, to explosive, electric, remote, etc. Grapple-gun. This item assisted Batman in scaling the various buildings of Gotham City. Utility Belt - Batman\\'s Utility Belt has compartments to hold several items, the contents of which change according to his needs, and often include items such as flashlights, laser cutters, underwater rebreathers, binoculars, a fingerprinting kit, flashbangs, remote controls for his vehicles, acid/base compounds, anti-toxins, mini-computer, and smoke pellets. Vehicles Batman has used several vehicles in the course of his crimefighting career, including: Batmobile Batwing Batcycle Batboat Appearances Batman: The Animated Series Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero The New Batman Adventures Superman: The Animated Series Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Batman Beyond Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Justice League Justice League Unlimited Static Shock'],\n",

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat.

Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen.

He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23. Has further learned Expanded Disguise techniques by the time he was 26. Batman has many aliases he uses to infiltrate the underworld or just to go undercover in public situations.

He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone. Even those who aren\\'t afraid of the likes of Superman fear Batman. His ability to inspire great fear made him eligible for induction into the Sinestro Corps, although he was able to fight off the power ring\\'s control. Genius-Level Intellect : Batman\\'s IQ is possibly well over 200; he is a brilliant, virtually peerless, detective, strategist, scientist, tactician, and commander; he is widely regarded as one of the keenest analytical minds on the planet. Given his lack of superpowers, he often uses cunning and planning to outwit his foes, rather than simply \"out-fighting\" them. Due to his mental training and being naturally gifted, he has acquired an an instant learning aptitude, parallel multitasking, eidetic/photographic memory, accelerated reading, and a more powerful memory. He is the second smartest person on Earth behind Lex Luthor. He is also a eclectic polymath genius. He has studied Biology, Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Mythology, Geography, & History. Gained degrees in Criminal Science, Forensics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Engineering by the time he was 21. He has mastered Diverse Environmental Training, Security Systems, and illusion/sleight of hand by the time he was 23. He gained even more degrees in Biology, Physics, Advanced Chemistry, and Technology by the time he was 25. He has learned Forensic, Medical Sciences, Expanded Computer and Engineering Sciences, and Expanded Device Pool use of personal powered armor and system, database creation on underworld crime bosses, rogue\\'s gallery foes and other supers; improved material sciences for body armor and micro-machinery by the time he was 26. Has also learned Advanced New Development in Forensic and Medical Sciences. Master Tactician : He is a master strategist and tactician commonly utilizes extremely cunning tactics, strategies, and protocols to outwit his foes. He is also an excellent leader and usually commands the Justice League and the Outsiders. Cyborg refers to him as the \"Greatest Tactician on the planet\" and has listed him as such in his database. Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber. Human intuition is an unlearnable trait and one of Batman\\'s most effective tools. Given any mystery, he can arrive at any conclusions with a fraction of the data. He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition. He has the ability and skills to access any file or record on the planet including redacted, sealed, or highly-encrypted; including radio frequencies, bus, train, and plane schedules. Expert Interrogator : Batman is adept in the use of interrogation techniques, employing anything from law enforcement methods to outright torture. Several techniques have been seen, include hanging a person over the edge of a building by one leg or chaining a person upside down and beating them. He usually just plain uses his frightening appearance to get answers. \"Fear is an excellent motivator\" he once said. Expert Driver : Bruce has expertise in evasive driving and combat piloting a variety of vehicles from motorcycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. Expert Tracker : Trained in hunting and tracking techniques by African Bushmen (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-eyed Brotherhood, among others). Multilingualism : He is extremely fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, Arabic, French, Latin, Cantonese, Mandarin, and much more. Indomitable Will : He has no known superhuman powers, but he does have an almost superhuman \"force of will\". Batman\\'s unstoppable determination, sense of discipline and morale, and strength of will make him an extremely formidable opponent. This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\".

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill.

Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23.

For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber.

Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition.

This makes him able to function while tolerating massive amounts of physical pain, and also allows him to resist telepathy or mind control. His willpower is strong enough to operate a Green Lantern Ring when necessary. He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations. The Batmobile is generally housed in the Batcave, though secret garages and maintenance points can be found around Gotham. Batplane : A custom jet engine used to patrol Gotham\\'s skyline. The plan is the fastest of Batman\\'s vehicles and is used for aerial pursuits. It is often stored in secret hanger located in or near the Batcave. Some stories and continuities have referred to the vehicle as \"the Batwing\". Batboat : A watercraft used to travel via the water. Stored within an underground dock at the Batcave, Batman uses the Batboat to deal with aquatic situations. In some stories, the Boat is capable of submerging underwater for deep-sea pursuits.

Batman Batman Bruce Wayne General Information Real name: Bruce Wayne First Appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) Created by: Bill Finger (writer) Bob Kane (artist) Affiliations: See: Relationships Abilities: Genius-level intelligence Master detective Master escapologist Peak human physical condition Master martial artist Access to high tech equipment Portrayed by: See: In Other Media Batman has been Gotham City \\'s protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League . Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters\\' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller \\'s 1986 Dark Knight series . That and the success of director Tim Burton \\'s 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World\\'s Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.

Bruce was brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\\' lives. As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman. Golden Age In the early strips, Batman\\'s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman\\'s relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City\\'s police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo\\'s secret identities joins their service. Silver Age After the introduction of DC Comics\\' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham\\'s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman\\'s history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents\\' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman\\'s origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World\\'s Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series\\' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month. In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics\\' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City\\'s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl . Batman\\'s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker , and the arrival of Ra\\'s Al Ghul . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team\\'s leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title. Modern Batman After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman\\'s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman\\'s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham\\'s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman\\'s existence. While Dick Grayson\\'s past remains much the same, the history of Jason Todd, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised back story for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era. In 1988\\'s \"Batman: A Death in the Family\" storyline from Batman #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently, Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crime-fighting. Batman works solo until the decade\\'s close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor. Knightfall Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the \"Death of Superman\" storyline, the publisher released the \"Knightfall\" storyline. In the storyline\\'s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman\\'s adventures, and Bruce Wayne\\'s quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman. 1994\\'s company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes\\' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison\\'s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team\\'s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade\\'s closing crossover arc. In 1998\\'s \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999\\'s \"No Man\\'s Land.\" While Lex Luthor rebuilds Gotham at the end of the \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted. DC\\'s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis, reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman\\'s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by Maxwell Lord is one of the main events that leads o the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In Infinite Crisis #7, Alexander Luthor, Jr. mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the \"New Earth\", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the \"Face the Face\" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, \"Batman & Son\", introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman\\'s son with Talia al Ghul. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Batman R.I.P. Batman was involved in a battle with Dr. Simon Hurt and the \"Black Glove,\" a criminal organization dedicated to corrupting virtue, as they attempted to destroy Batman and everything for which he stands. Using a mixture of physical and psychological attacks, the Black Glove tests Batman\\'s resolve, forcing him to temporarily adopt the crazed persona of the \"Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\" He is then led to Arkham Asylum to face the Joker. Seemingly defeated, Batman is buried alive by the Black Glove, a group that includes Bruce Wayne\\'s girlfriend, Jezebel Jet, who has betrayed him. With the assistance of Robin and Nightwing, he turns the tables on his foes. In a final confrontation with Dr. Hurt, Batman is caught in a helicopter crash. The storyline concludes with both Batman\\'s fate and the true identity of Dr. Hurt still up in the air. Hurt himself repeatedly claimed to be Thomas Wayne throughout the story, while Batman apparently believed him to be Mangrove Pierce, a crazed actor. \"Death\" In Final Crisis #6 , Batman confronts Darkseid in the villain\\'s bunker. He states that he will make an exception to his \"no firearms\" rule and shoots Darkseid using the bullet that killed Orion and hits Darkseid. As Darkseid dies he fires the Omega Sanction (which traps its victim\\'s soul in a series of alternate lives, each worse than the one before it), from his eyes, and hits Batman. Before the Omega Sanction hits Batman he silently says, \"Gotcha\". It is unknown if \\' Batman knew Darkseid shot the Omega sanction or he knew it was coming and accepted his fate. (Morrison notes that Batman\\'s use of the gun is symbolic as “the root of the Batman mythos is the gun and the bullet that created Batman. So, Batman himself is finally standing there to complete that big mythical circle and to have the image of Batman up against the actual personification of evil and now he\\'s got the gun and he\\'s got the bullet. It seemed to me to work.\") At the close of the penultimate issue in the series, Superman returns to Earth from the 31st century, where he was given access to the reality-altering Miracle Machine by Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. In a fit of desperate rage, Superman attacks Darkseid\\'s bunker, finding Batman\\'s charred corpse within. The Dark Knight is seemingly dead. However, the Omega Sanction does not kill its victims: instead, it sends their consciousness traveling through parallel worlds, and at the conclusion of Final Crisis, it is made clear that this is the fate that has befallen the still-living Batman, as he watches the passing of Anthro in the distant past. For the most part, Batman\\'s family and friends come to believe that Bruce Wayne is indeed dead. The only exception to this is Bruce\\'s adopted son Tim Drake , who believes firmly that Bruce is still alive. After having the Robin identity taken from him by Dick Grayson, the new Batman, and giving it to Bruce\\'s son, Damian, Tim takes on the identity of Red Robin , and begins searching the world for signs that Bruce Wayne is still alive. While searching in Baghdad, Tim finds a wall painting of the Bat emblem that was painted by Bruce upon the passing of Anthro. Tim realizes that Bruce is not dead, but rather lost in time. In Blackest Night, the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne\\'s body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps. Deadman, whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members. The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand\\'s lord, Nekron, to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as \"Bruce Wayne\", knowing that the body was not authentic. In Batman and Robin\\'s third storyline, \"Blackest Knight,\" it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of Batmen. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne\\'s real body, attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body. Return It is revealed in the Final Crisis that Bruce Wayne is not dead, but in fact, lost in time and amnesiac. Maintaining a presence in Gotham, Bruce would be sent He appeared in the Paleolithic era, the Puritan witch-hunting era, the 17 century, the Wild West days, the years he grew up in, and finally the far future. During these travels, Bruce fights an early Vandal Savage , investigates a murder under the guise of a witch-hunter, fights the dreaded pirate Blackbeard , and arranged the meeting of his ancestors Alan Wayne and Catherin Van Derm . During these encounters, Bruce was chased by Darkseid\\'s Hyper-Adapter , which had be sent following him as a fallback plan to wipe out the present day Earth. After an encounter with the Black Glove in the days following his parents\\' murder, Bruce gained access to Professor Carter Nichols \\' time machine and used it to travel to the End of the Universe. Upon arrival, Bruce\\'s memories returned to him, during which he realized Darkseid had simply used his Omega Beams to banish him through time intentionally. Each time jump built up Omega Energy that would have destroyed Earth when he returned to the present day. Having mitigated the plan with the time jump, Bruce was rescued by Superman, Rip Hunter, Green Lantern and Tim (now using the alias Red Robin). Merging with both the Hyper-Adapter and the robotic Architects , he returns within the Time Bubble so that the Justice League can remove the creature and throw it into the time stream. To remove the Omega Energy, Bruce goes into a medically induced coma. During it, he is offered a chance to embrace the Anti-Life Equation by Darkseid, though he refuses. Upon awaking, Bruce decides to not only return to Gotham but to spread Batman\\'s operations outside of Gotham City, leading to the foundation of Batman Incorporated . Upon his return, Bruce Wayne goes public with the news that he has been funding his crusade the entire time, though does not inform Gotham that he is Batman. Sharing the identity with Dick (who had taken it whilst he was \"dead\", Batman sets out to create a worldwide crime fighting organization known as Batman Incorporated. The idea behind the organization is that each country or region will have its own specific Batman that will be funded by Bruce Wayne and his business empire. New 52 Due to the effects of Flashpoint , the entire history of DC Universe is completely rewritten, resulting in the move to \"Earth-Prime\". Batman\\'s history remains relatively unchanged, though the timeframe of his operations are reduced to 6 years and many of his allies are placed in different situations. Most notably, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing , Barbara Gordon returns as Batgirl, Tim has only used the Red Robin identity, and his romantic relationship with Catwoman has been reduced to several rooftop encounters. As Bruce Wayne, he works with Mayoral candidate Lincoln March to rebuild the city. Whilst investigating a murder, Batman discovers that a secret society known as the Court of Owls has been operating in Gotham City. After being trapped in a underground maze by the group, he defeats their Talon and organizes the Bat-Family to help fight the court. After defeating their Talons , Batman discovers that March has actually been a member of the Court who believes himself to be his brother. Able to defeat him, Batman investigates further to discover that his parents did have another child, but they died shortly after birth. Sometime later, the Joker comes out of hiding to attack both Batman and his allies, claiming to know their identities. This culminates in a confrontation in the Batcave, where Batman threatens to reveal the Joker\\'s identity. Sometime later, Damian is killed by an insane clone under Talia\\'s control called The Heretic . Donning the Suit of Sorrows , Batman defeats both of them, though remains in mourning for some time. After the Earth is taken over by both evil counterparts from Earth-3 , Batman works with Catwoman, Cyborg, Lex Luthor and Earth-3 counterpart defeat the Crime Syndicate and free the imprisoned Justice League members. During the mission, he learns the Crime Syndicate have exposed Nightwing\\'s identity, forcing him to fake his death. Whilst Luthor and his allies work to defeat the Syndicate, Batman releases the Justice League with the help of the Martian Manhunter. After the incident, he arranges Dick to infiltrate Spyral whilst he rounds up Gotham\\'s criminals who have taken over in his absence. Sometime later, Scarecrow traps Batman and his allies in an idealized version of Gotham , though they manage to escape. Sometime later, a year long attempt is made by March to destroy his personal life, though Batman is able to foil him with help from his allies. After Damian and Talia\\'s bodies are stolen by the League of Assassins, Batman discovers a plot by both Ra\\'s al Ghul and Darkseid to resurrect them. Venturing to Apokolyps, he uses the Chaos Crystal to resurrect his son. Batman is later attacked by the Justice League, who he discovers are under the Joker\\'s control. After defeating them in the Justice Buster Batsuit , he discovers his enemy plans to destroy Gotham with an army of Jokerized citizens. During the incident, Batman learns the Joker knows his identity and that he\\'s survived their various encounters with the use of Dionesium, the chemical that gives Lazarus Pits their resurrecting abilities. After recovering the chemical to cure the outbreak, he is presumed dead after battling Joker. After his apparent death, Gordon leaves the role of Commissioner and becomes a new Batman, albeit one officially supported by the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is eventually discovered to have survived due to being exposed to Dionesium, though heavily amnesiac. Ignorant of his life of vigilantism, Bruce instead tried to settle down and find a life of happiness, reuniting with his old flame, Julie Madison. After a new supervillain called Mr. Bloom apparently killed Gordon and took over Gotham, Bruce learnt about his life as Batman and, after talking to a stranger , returned to the Batcave for the first time since his final encounter with Joker. Unable to recover the skills required to fight Bloom and his underlings, he decided to use an experimental machine that would upload his memories and skills into a body, but at the cost of his new life. With help from Alfred and Julie, Bruce went through with the procedure and returned to Gotham as Batman. With help from Gordon and a street gang modeled after Robin, he was able to defeat Bloom and save the city once again. With Batman\\'s return to Gotham, the GCPD shut down their Batmen project and reinstated Gordon as Commissioner. After the incident under the caves, Batman decided to investigate Nth metal, believing there to be some connection between it, Dionesium and the Court of Owls. To that end, he approached the leader of the Robin street gang, Duke Thomas , and offered to train him into another hero, as opposed to another Robin. In reality, Bruce knew about his status as a metahuman and wished for him to help investigate the court\\'s plans. DC Rebirth After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence . At some point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called Gotham and Gotham Girl , two metahumans with powers similar to Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham\\'s new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and Psycho Pirate , the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman, with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters. Whilst Claire\\'s condition worsened, Batman tracked Psycho Pirate to Santa Prisca, where he discovered he was being used by Bane as a substitute to Venom. At Amanda Waller\\'s suggestion, Bruce put together a team of supervillains to break into the island and recover the Psycho Pirate. Among the teammates was Catwoman, who was serving a life sentence after apparently killing 127 members of a terrorist organization. During the mission, they recollided their relationship and, during her last night of freedom, Batman learned that she was actually taking the blame for her friend Holly Robinson . When Bane attacked Gotham to recover Psycho Pirate, he employed the entire Bat-Family and Rogues Gallery, to protect him and Claire long enough to cure her of the Pirate\\'s influence. After an incident where the Justice League and Suicide Squad were forced to team up, Batman began constructing an new team of backstreet heroes to act as another team alternative for the League. After he was attacked by the Reverse-Flash , Batman would witness his apparent death and, with the Flash\\'s help, decided to investigate what had caused the incident. Together, the two discovered the Flashpoint timeline had continued to exist and encountered that timeline\\'s Batman, Thomas Wayne. As they escaped the timeline, his father urged Bruce to give up his life as Batman and find happiness. After this, Bruce proposed to Catwoman, which she accepted the proposal. Following this, they travelled to Khadym to extradite Holly, bringing them into conflict with Talia. After the mission, Batman began following up on the Nth metal investigation. However, he realized that this was actually a plot by the Court of Owls to open a gateway to the Dark Multiverse , having been exposed to the necessary materials since reality\\'s change. This brought twisted versions of himself gaining access to the universe, lead by Barbatos and the Batman Who Laughs . To defeat the threat, he worked with the Justice League and other superheroes. Batman also defeated the Batman Who Laughs, with the assistance of Joker. After a separate confrontation with the Joker, Batman and Catwoman decided to marry as their alter-egos. However, Selina left him at the alter after a conversation with Holly, leaving him depressed. Shortly afterwards, KGBeast shot Dick, leaving him with amnesia. After tracking the assassin down and nearly killing the assassin, Batman learned that Bane had orchestrated it and his engagement to Selina to break him down mentally. Pursuing the lead further, this only pushed him into events that drained him further and led his allies to question his sanity. After being locked up in Arkham Asylum by Bane and subjected to Fear Toxin infused nightmares, Batman finally learned that the Flashpoint Batman was also involved. However, both villains orchestrated their endgame, taking over Gotham and defeating him together. After the confrontation, Thomas tried to convince Bruce to resurrect his mother in a Lazarus Pit in the Arabian desert. Though he seemed to agree to the plan, he instead hid the body in the desert and fought his father. However, Bruce held back against Thomas, leading to his defeat. Left to die, Bruce was barely able to escape and fled into the wilderness. At the point of death, he was discovered and rescued by Selina, who had also discovered Bane\\'s conspiracy. After being nursed back to health, they agreed to work together to defeat the two villains and rekindled their relationship. Acquiring Clayface\\'s help, Batman and Catwoman subdued the other villains and together defeated Bane. However, they were captured by Thomas, during which Bruce learned that Alfred had been killed. Though the sight was intended to finally break his will, this instead convinced Bruce to continue his mission and, no longer holding back, defeated his father. After the fight, he committed the Flashpoint Batman to Arkham. The Joker War After a confrontation with the Legion of Doom , Batman learned that a legion of assassins had been sent to Gotham and were targeting Catwoman, Penguin and Riddler. After defeating most the group, he learned that they and the Joker had been involved with a master criminal called the Designer . Believed dead after a meeting gone wrong, Batman learned that he\\'d planned schemes for the villains that had been abandoned after his death. Whilst Catwoman attempted to stop her plans to steal his fortune, Batman defeated Deathstroke and stopped Riddler\\'s scheme. Tracking down \"the Designer\", Batman realized too late that these were actually a larger scheme by the Joker and to steal his fortune and turn it against him. As Joker used the acquired resources to wage an endless war against Gotham\\'s civil citizens and law enforcement organizations, Batman confronted his new sidekick Punchline , during which he was injected with a new toxin. Joker also used the Designer\\'s gas to resurrect the bodies of all his victims, using them to attack him. Physically and mentally drained from the fight, Batman was rescued by Harley Quinn, who helped him purge Punchline\\'s toxins from his body. Whilst recovering, Bruce resolved to become a better Batman by living within and operating within Gotham, rather than outside of it. After subduing Punchline, Batman contacted the rest of the Bat Family to help defeat Joker\\'s forces. In the aftermath of Joker\\'s attacks, Batman learned that the survivor of one of Joker\\'s murders, Bao Pham, had become a murderous vigilante called Clownhunter . Confronting him, he offered to rehabilitate and urged him to give up the vigilante life. After learning that Damian had begun killing criminals, Batman helped the Teen Titans stop him from killing KGBeast. In the aftermath of the battle, his son abandoned the Robin identity and left Gotham. Batman also learned that his former-friend and international vigilante Ghost-Maker had come to Gotham to bring his own methods of crime fighting, having perceived the Joker War as a final failure. After stopping him from targeting Clownhunter, Batman made amends with the vigilante and convinced him to help patrol the city. Infinite Frontier This section is a stub . You can help the Batman wiki by expanding it. Personality Batman, in most of his incarnations, is a dark and brooding hero with a personal vendetta against crime and injustice. Psychologically traumatized by the death of his parents, Batman has sworn to rid Gotham from the criminal elements that took his parents away from him. He is extremely pessimistic and suspicious, which often makes it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, the Robins or the Batgirls. Despite this, Batman has proved to have a great love for humanity, which was instilled by his parents. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a crusader against child abuse. Indeed, Batman\\'s oath of vengeance is tempered with the greater ideal of justice. He refrains from killing, as he feels this would not make him any better than the criminals he fights. He is also a very prominent member of the Justice League and the founder of the Outsiders. To protect his secret identity, Batman has constructed a fake persona he can use in his civilian identity. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is a self-absorbed, irresponsible playboy and philanthropist. Only his closest allies know that this attitude is just an act. Relationships Family Throughout the years, Bruce Wayne\\'s family has often changed, with member either appearing, been added, and retconned both in and out of continuity. Despite this, it is widely regarded that he has two different families: the biological Wayne Family and the surrogate Batman Family . The two most important figures of the Wayne family are Bruce\\'s parents Thomas and Martha Wayne , whos\\' murder served as the main factor that inspired activities as Batman. However, their charitable activities has also inspired him to use him to continue such causes, often to ensure he can improve the living conditions of Gotham\\'s citizens. Several other members of the Wayne Family have also appeared over the years, such as his uncle Philip Wayne , aunt Agatha Wayne , various cousins such as Van Wayne , and propertied brothers like Thomas Wayne, Jr. and Lincoln March . The Waynes also share a vast history with Gotham City and the wider world of the DC Universe. Though his mother, Bruce\\'s maternal family includes the Kanes , who\\'s members have included various members tied to Gotham\\'s past. After DC\\'s restructuring in the Post-Crisis continuities, Alfred Pennyworth \\'s relationship has changed from serving just as his butler to also being Bruce\\'s surrogate father and legal guardian. Though this, Bruce has become linked to the Pennyworth family, including Alfred\\'s daughter Julia . Likewise, the Batman Family itself are widely considered part of Batman\\'s surrogate family, with members either being adopted by him (such as Lance Bruner , Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Cassandra Cain , Tim Drake and Duke Thomas ) or tied to him via family relations ( Kathy Kane , Bette Kane and Kate Kane ). Through relationships with several women, Bruce has had children, notably Helena Wayne , Bruce Wayne, Jr. and Aion (with Selina Kyle / Catwoman ) and Damian Wayne , Tallant Wayne and Athanasia al Ghul (with Talia al Ghul ). Sometimes this is due to scientific methods, such as the Damian clone, Heretic , and (in some continuities) Terry McGinnis / Batman Beyond and his brother Matt . Many of his children have also started crime-fighting activities, often alongside him or when he is unable to assume the identity of Batman. Some continuities also stated that Bruce will have descendants through them or through other children, many of whom will become Batmen or Batwomen of the future. Romances Throughout the years, Batman has had many relationships with many women, most of which seem to last only a short time. These range from similar social standings and citizens of Gotham to allies and enemies alike. Bruce\\'s relationships with woman has been complicated by his Batman identity, with them usually deteriorating because he does not tell them about his activities or, on the occasion he has, they cannot stand by his lifestyle. Though he has shared mutual attractions with allies, they usually go no further than flirting, due to commitments with other characters or brief stints that end as quickly as his civilian partnerships. Likewise, Batman has also shared romances with enemies, though they usually end due to their imprisonment or learning it to be part of their schemes. Batman\\'s most long standing relationship has often been with Selina Kyle/Catwoman , whom he\\'s been attached to as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The two have ranged from one-time encounter to full-time relationships as their civilian identities, though not always aware of the others\\' dual identity. On the times where Selina has learned this, there has been more acceptance compared with other partners. However, due to their different ideals and sides of the law, Batman and Catwoman have often been depicted as trying to tied the other to their point of view, though often unsuccessfully or part of a ruse. However, Catwoman\\'s transition to anti-hero in recent years has often mitigated this crisis. Other prominent romantic partners have included reporter Vicki Vale , actress Julie Madison , socialites Linda Page and Silver St. Cloud , and bodyguard Sasha Bordeaux . Batman has also shared relationships with allies like Wonder Woman , Kathy Kane , Black Canary , Zatanna and Lois Lane , and enemies like Talia al Ghul , Poison Ivy , Nocturna and the McKillen sisters. Allies Though often depicted as self-reliant, Batman has often worked heavily with various other heroes and allies in his activities. These have ranged from officials in Gotham City to heroes throughout the DC Universe. The most prominent ally outside of the Batman family has often been Gotham City\\'s Police Commissioner James Gordon , with whom Batman has worked to clean up crime and corruption in the city. His alliance with Gordon has often been depicted as both a undying trust to skeptical alignment. Batman\\'s connection with Gordon has also ensured that he can operate more easily, often to investigate cases too big for the GCPD and ensuring he can assist the police in matters. Outside of Gordon, Batman has established working relationships with other members of the service, including Harvey Bullock , Renee Montoya , Crispus Allen and Jason Bard . Through both his masked and civilian identity, Batman has also allied with various sections of Gotham\\'s society, ranging from street-level contacts to officials of Gotham. These include various Gotham City Mayors , members of its council and prominent members of its social circles. Through Wayne Enterprises and its subsidiaries, Batman has also be able to obtain information and resources need to fight crime. Employees and associates like Lucius Fox and Harold Allnut have also helped maintain equipment and gadgets used in the field, in addition to keeping his identity secret. Batman also has received medical aid from family friend Dr. Leslie Thompkins , though she\\'s often voiced disapproval of his lifestyle. Batman\\'s closest partnerships are often members of the Batman Family , including the various Robins and Batgirls . These have also branched out into other alliances with vigilantes and crime-fighters in Gotham, such as the Huntress , Onyx and Batwing . Batman has also worked with various superheroes in other cities across the United States, including Superman , Wonder Woman , Green Arrow , Black Canary , both the Barry Allen and Wally West incarnations of the Flash , and various members of the Green Lantern Corps . With many of these allies, he has also served as a founding member of superhero teams such as the Justice League , Justice Society of America and the Outsiders . Through international connections with other vigilantes around the world, Batman has established international crime-fighting organizations such as Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated . Alliances with other superheroes have also stretched to other publishers\\' characters, including Marvel Comics\\' characters (notably Spider-Man , the Hulk , Captain America and Daredevil ), Image Comics\\' Spawn , and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Enemies Since his debut, Batman has made a large variety of enemies and foes, from small-time criminals to major players in Gotham\\'s underworld. Some of these have also been major international players outside of the city, ranging from international gangs to terrorist cells. Batman\\'s arch-nemesis is generally considered to be the Joker , a clowned-themed criminal who\\'s goals and motivations either change on a day or remain secret to anyone but himself. Often confronting him more than any other adversary (thus far), the two\\'s relationship has often categorized as polar opposites: Batman being more serious and fighting for order while Joker is jovial and enjoys inflicting chaos onto Gotham\\'s streets. Batman has also suffered perhaps the most tragedy in his battles with the Joker, including such as the murder of Jason Todd at his hands. In some adventures, Joker has attempted to drive Batman to kill him just to see whether he can push him over the edge. Batman\\'s costumed enemies are often referred to as his \"Rogues Gallery\", with some of its most notably including Catwoman , the Penguin , Two-Face , Poison Ivy , the Riddler , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Ra\\'s al Ghul , Bane , Harley Quinn , Clayface , the Mad Hatter , Hugo Strange , Killer Croc , Deadshot and Hush . He has also taken on major crime lords like Rupert Thorne and Carmine Falcone , mad scientists like Doctor Death and Professor Milo , supernatural foes like Solomon Grundy and Doctor Hurt , and other members of superheroes\\' rogues galleries, like Lex Luthor and Deathstroke . Batman\\'s foes most commonly operate in or target Gotham City, thus his operations focus mainly on it and the surrounding area. Abilities Although he has no explicit superpowers, Batman often relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\". Over years of intense training, Batman has developed the following skills and abilities: Peak Human Condition : Through intense training, specialized diet and meditation, Batman represents the absolute pinnacle of human physical prowess. His physical attributes is at the natural limits far above than that of an Olympic-level athlete that has ever competed. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, healing and endurance are at the peak of human potential and perfection. Batman began his physical and mental conditioning when he was 10 and then intense physical training and weight lifting at age 12. He had mastered full body control by the time he was 18. Bruce Wayne, since the age of 15, has created a strict diet to enable his body to develop and operate at its most proficient, along with biofeedback treatments. Batman being able to perform amazing physical feats is due to his superior physique, and has often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other powers greatly exceeded his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and has attained it through constant intensive training and determination. Following his recent exposure to Dionesium he has become much stronger and faster than ever before. He also has micro sleep, which he has mastered the art of power-naps and evolved it into what he calls micro sleep. Although these periods of sleeps are longer in duration (1 hour), they would be more replenishing and much harder to wake up from. Batman has also been shown to be capable of going over 4 days with no sleep at all. Peak Human Strength : In terms of brute strength, Batman is one of the strongest non-metahumans alive. Batman engages in an intensive exercise regimen, and because of this his strength, like all other physical attributes, are at the peak of human perfection. He can casually overhead press lift 1000 lbs, bench-press 1 ton (more or less), and has in some cases demonstrated enough strength to easily rip steel bars from their moorings, and snap high-strength handcuffs with ease. Following his recent Dionesium exposure he is even stronger. Hence, he can break steel chains and cuffs with ease, smash stone barehanded, punch down 3-inch chromium-steel doors, support a ceiling that weighed 1000 lbs over his head for an extended period of time, and rip metal prison bars with his bare hands. Batman has demonstrated enough strength to easily overpower dozens of men at once, effortlessly lifting a full grown man in the air with one arm and throwing him several meters, tear off an airplane door in mid-flight with one arm, slowing down a speeding car with his grapple gun, and even punch a SWAT officer through a brick wall with no strain, giving the officer internal injuries. Deathstroke a near-metahuman once stated that Batman \"hits harder than most beings with superhuman strength.\" Batman also has more than strong enough to pull 5 men over in a tug-o-war match with one arm, kick a concrete pillar in half while his legs were damaged, lift an entire bench-press bar with one arm and throw it like a bowling-ball, kick a thick tree in half during his early days, and break or bend guns with his mere grip on many occasions, all performed with casual ease. During his exercise regimes, Batman could bench-press at least 1 ton (more or less), dumbbell curl tens of hundreds of pounds without even flinching, and do over 300 lbs of tricep extensions while injured. Using highly effective muscle control, Batman can apply practically superhuman force in his physical attacks, able to overpower Killer Croc and the Venom enhanced Bane (despite their superior strength). Peak Human Durability : His muscles and bones are far tougher and vastly denser than ordinary humans; making him extremely durable to certain degrees. Augmented by his iron forged willpower he can tolerate massive amount of physical pain and damage. His physique which is rigorously trained to the uttermost human limit and is extremely tough and resistant to damage, which allows him to survived dangers that would have killed most other people, like being slammed straight through thick reinforced concrete with little to no injury. He is able to withstand being stabbed and shot multiple times, as well as beatings from superhumans such as Killer Croc, Bane (on Venom), and withstand a few blows during a brief tussle from Wonder Woman despite her vast superhuman strength. Also Batman seems to be highly resistant to the blunt trauma of surviving falls of considerable distance such as multi-story drops and falls, evident when he was stabbed numerous times then kicked out of a building and landed from 30-stories high with little injuries with no Batsuit or gadgets. Batman\\'s durability allowed him to be completely unmoved by a chair being picked up and smashed against his head, and had unnoticeable injuries from a 10,000 volt electric shock. He also once took a bullet to the chest before his suit was armored and lived. Peak Human Speed : He can run and move at speeds comparable to the finest human athletes. In combat he is extremely agile and evasive, supplementing his strength with sheer speed to defeat his enemies, he could even match the master assassin Deathstroke\\'s combat speed. Occasionally, Batman has shown enough speed to catch up or outrun a speeding car while running on foot. He is capable of moving faster than SWAT can align their weapons as evident that most men can\\'t shoot or even aim guns fast enough to get a bead on him. Batman has outran a huge explosion, ran faster than GCPD could even see, catches up to a train, moves faster than an Olympic-had ever seen, and crosses 10 feet to punch down Hugo Strange so fast he could react. He is typically shown and described as running and moving so fast he is a blur. Peak Human Agility : His agility is greater than that of a Chinese acrobat and superior to an Olympic-gold athlete gymnast. He can flawlessly coordinate his body with perfect balance, flexibility, and dexterity. His main phase of movement is Parkour which he learned in France and uses it to scale the cities rooftops in an acrobatic manner. He is capable of completing a triple somersault, running across thin wire cable which showcased his balance. Bruce regularly practices his agility by practicing gymnastics blindfolded. Batman\\'s balance is shown to be practically perfect when he ran across a thin wire-cable and has a lot of midair maneuverability. Bruce is shown multiple time to be able to jump very high and leap very far. Peak Human Stamina : Bruce\\'s highly trained and developed body generates considerably less fatigue toxins and is much more resistant to fatigue toxins than normal humans, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. His lung capacity is so great that he can hold his breath underwater for over 7 minutes with little to no strain. In his early days he once fought in a death gauntlet for 28 hours straight before collapsing from exhaustion. Batman has demonstrated exercising extensively with a rigorous training regime that lasted 1 hour, yet wasn\\'t nearly satisfied. He can exert himself at peak capacity without slowing down for several hours before showing signs of fatigue or began tiring, evident on a few occasions when he fought days at a time; though was extremely exhausted physically and mentally. He is shown to be completely fine in falling -20 degree temperature and stand in a sub-zero temperature body of water without almost any clothes, survive in the vacuum of space for 24 seconds and easily withstands Planet Krypton-like conditions; which has 5 times Earth gravity. Peak Human Reflexes : Batman\\'s reflexes are seemingly superhuman, and is far superior to normal humans. He is able to quickly react instantaneously to simultaneous attacks from multiple enemies and dodge rapid gunfire at point-blank range on many occasions, though he can get hit if there are to many to evade. Bruce\\'s reflexes were honed to such a degree that he has caught one of Green Arrow\\'s arrows in mid flight from behind when he tried to shoot him. Bruce himself mentally stated in mid-combat that he literally perceives bullets in slow motion, and normal humans moves are also telegraphed in slow motion to him, as evident on another incident when he noted that it takes less than a second for him to cripple 3 men. He has also been shown to catch a grenade and throw it back at the enemy, catch a speeding baseball at the last moment, disarm multiple gangsters before any of them could pull the trigger, block a crossbolt from only 5 feet away, dodge Supergirl\\'s laser heat-vision and deflect 4 high-speed shuriken at once with one batarang. Peak Human Metabolism : Batman\\'s natural healing, metabolism, immune system, are at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal much faster than normal humans, he is able to heal broken bones, fractures, torn muscles, gunshot, knife, puncture wounds and other major injuries all within a few weeks and minor injuries like cuts, scrapes and burns within a few hours to days. His immune system fights off microbes, infections, disorders, illnesses, sicknesses far better than normal (but is not immune). His healing time is very short, as he recovered from a broken back within an unknown amount of weeks. After undergoing the same treatment as the Joker, with the chemical compound Dionesium. Batman has developed the ability to recover from almost any injury, like acid being poured in his eyes. This included healing himself fully from all the scars and trauma he acquired over the years, increasing his strength and speed. Peak Human Senses : Through meditation, Batman\\'s five senses are pushed at the highest limits of human perfection; meaning that his sense of sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste are very keen. At one time he was able to hear a sniper load his weapon from across the street a block over, hear an alarm three blocks away, hear the subtle movements of bats, see so far that Robin had to use binoculars to see with clarity and allegedly has the sight of an eagle; allowing him to see even the slightest shifts in the air enough to fight an invisible person. His awareness, instincts, and senses combined make him extremely alert to danger, bordering a sixth sense. Even Commissioner Gordon has commented saying \"it\\'s almost like he has a sixth sense\". It is also implied that he has a slight ability to sense chi/ki. Master Martial Artist : Batman has entirely mastered and even perfected every single form of hand-to-hand combat known to man and is one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known. He was trained around the world for years to master multiple martial arts. Master Kirigi stated to Bruce that he is a natural genius in fighting due to \"his great violent nature inside of him\". Even Karate Kid of the future was very surprised that Bruce adapted and learned future-style combat in seconds that he never even experienced.

Batman has proven he easily defeat a highly trained Green Beret within seconds, defeat multiple groups of armed opponents, fight evenly with Lady Shiva and Deathstroke multiple times, and defeat enemies that are physically superior to him through the use of sheer skill. He has also trained many other people to be the fighters they are (Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake, and so on) and it can be inferred from him turning them into the fighters that they are that he is indeed a skilled fighter. Weapon Mastery : Through his martial arts training, he has become an expert on virtually all types of weaponry. He is an exceptional swordsman as evident in his fight with Ra\\'s al Ghul, his proficiency in Jui-Jitsu can proclaim his swordsmanship skill. Proficient with most melee weapons because of his mastery of Okinawan Kobudo . He was trained and became extremely proficient in all arms. He soon learned expanded melee weapon techniques and he has learned expanded weapon/device sciences. He still practices during his combat sessions to keep his skills intact, though he prefers unarmed combat. Expert Marksman : Due in part to his training in Ninjutsu, Batman almost never misses his targets, 9/10 times he\\'s successful. Bruce is a highly skilled expert marksman with throwing projectile weapons, archery and firearms when it comes to small, distant, moving or even invisible targets. He has been practicing such skills since the early days of his training and is almost on par with the Green Arrow in terms of accuracy and precision. He was shown to be able to flick a light switch on from a distance and hit a penny dropping in the air from a distance both done with a Batarang. He is equally skilled with firearms, though he doesn\\'t like offensive guns and prefers not to use them. Bruce is also one of the world\\'s top ten marksmen.

He regularly practices his gymnastics and acrobatics blindfolded. Master Spy : His advanced and extensive Ninjutsu and law enforcement training has made him a master at stealth, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Bruce is capable of breaching very high-security facilities with ease and without being detected. Batman\\'s stealth prowess is so great that he\\'s capable of effortlessly breaking into a top-secret base a mile under Gotham City, infiltrate the President\\'s White House in a short amount of time, breaking and entering into the Pentagon instantly, the maximum security Arkham Asylum, a Justice league facility, Cadmus\\' and Oracle\\'s supposedly impenetrable hideout, and even the infamous Area 51 and Area 52 completely unnoticed. He has proven to be very familiar with military protocols and codes, as he casually anticipated and countered law enforcement/paramilitary tactics and strategies. Bruce has also learned how to pick various locks when he was in grade school. Disguise Mastery : Has mastered the art of disguise by the time he was 23.

He has effortlessly escaped handcuffs casually on multiple occasions within seconds, even going as far as saying \"they were a joke\". When arrested and locked up in prison, Bruce quickly identified three ways to seamlessly escape his cell with no tools or gadgets at all. Master Intimidator : It is widely known that Batman has the ability to instill fear in others, even the people that know him best are intimidated by him, Batman regularly forces common criminals flee in terror, despite there is no evidence that he would actually kill anyone.

Batman is known as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) strategists and tacticians in the entire DC universe, challenged only by Deathstroke who has enhanced mental performance. For these reasons he is listed as the one of the greatest living strategist and tactician in the entire multiverse and recognized as the Justice Leagues leader and tactical commander. Master Detective : He is considered the \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\" without peer. Bruce is capable of observation, forensic investigation, and inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber.

He has aided GCPD in solving hundreds of inconclusive crime. Batman regularly outsmart the highly intelligent Riddler and commonly uses his detective skills, deductive intuition to match the unpredictable Joker, and even able to deduce the mere physics and mechanics of a Green Lantern ring. Master Hacker : Batman can hack into almost any computer and learn what he needs from its database. Batman is at times, often helped by Oracle or Alfred with computer-related matters as he pales in comparison to their skills; this usually frees up his time to focus on other problems. Bruce was able to hack and record the mobile frequency of the Suicide Squad members brain bombs and deactivate them. He was easily able to hack and steal all data and information from Area 51 and NASA. Batman was able to hack and overload Cyborg\\'s internal systems, putting him into a dream-like condition.

He is also unshakably devoted to his solemn vow never to kill, in spite of his vicious inner temptation to do so - the latter of which factors is displayed prominently when facing the Joker. Paraphernalia Equipment Batman\\'s equipment often changes depending on the times and writers. The most utilized of these include the following: Batsuit : Batman\\'s costume is composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it is bulletproof and resistant to most forms of attack (explosions, blunt trauma, falls, etc.) It is also flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and the boots are reinforced to nullify the impact of punches and kicks. Batman\\'s gauntlets have retractable metallic blades on their sides. The cape is extremely light and can be used to glide long distances. The cowl is composed in small part by lead, which shields Batman\\'s face from identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is outfitted with security systems (aggravating gas, electric blasts, etc.) like the utility belt. The mask is also a transmitter-receiver. Utility Belt : Batman keeps most of his personal field equipment in his iconic yellow utility belt. Over the years, it has produced grappling ropes, nerve toxins, batarangs, smoke bombs, explosives, investigation equipment, cutting tools, gasmasks and rebreathers . Superman also entrusted Batman with a ring made of Kryptonite , should the Man of Steel ever need to be reined in (because of mind-control by a super-villain, etc.). Batrope : Since his debut, Batman has often made use of a \"silken cord\" to traverse the rooftops of Gotham. It is often equipped or combined with either grappling hooks or batarangs to attach it onto objects. Since the 1980s, Batman has often used a Grapple Gun to fire and ascend the rope. Former Equipment White Lantern Power Battery Weapons Batarangs : Small bat-shaped throwing weapons. Originally based on Aboriginal Australian boomerangs, more recent years have depicted them as being similar to shuriken. Batman often made use of gadget variant Batarangs on multiple occasions, including explosive, electrically charged, remote-controlled and heated variants. Gas Capsules : Small miniature pellets containing chemical components that, when mixed, release airborne agents. These have often been depicted to contain incapacitating components, such as tear and knockout gas. Batman has more commonly used Smoke Capsules , which release thick clouds of smoke to distract enemies or cover escapes. Transportation Batmobile : A modified car used for both high-speed pursuits and general travel. Batman often uses the Batmobile to patrol the streets of Gotham or as his general response to situations.

His personal favourite was the Gray Ghost , watching the television show with his father. On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to Wonder Woman , Bruce hadn\\'t been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes\\' faithful friend and butler, Alfred Pennyworth Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from Yoru Sensei . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor\\'s daughter Zatanna became very close. As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with Andrea Beaumont . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\". War on Crime Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the Batcave . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city\\'s underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in Dick Grayson as his ward after witnessing his parents\\' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down their murderer . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and Commissioner James Gordon , working with them to control crime in Gotham. Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included the Penguin , Poison Ivy , Mr. Freeze and the Scarecrow . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including Catwoman and Two-Face . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered the Joker , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created. New Adventures Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as Batwoman . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called Batgirl began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father\\'s legacy as the next Police Commissioner. Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned Tim Drake from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder. Joining Up For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called Blüdhaven . Batman would later find himself in Metropolis , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with Lex Luthor , Batman would find himself working with Superman to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker\\'s plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue\\'s gallery. He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another\\'s home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity. Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper. It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world\\'s greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League. Saving the World Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech\\'s deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station\\'s antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J\\'onn J\\'onzz\\' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna\\'s destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch. Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman\\'s mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don\\'t even think about it\". When the Imperium\\'s attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation. Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J\\'onn J\\'onzz. After freeing J\\'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J\\'onn J\\'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of Wonder Woman . The Flash arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing\\'s severed wing. After J\\'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium\\'s invasion of Mars , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium\\'s factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun\\'s rays. The heroes split up to disable the factories. Batman went to Giza, Egypt with Wonder Woman and J\\'onn J\\'onzz. The trio infiltrated the factory and found the Ion Matrix Crystal, a vital component of the plant. Batman and Wonder Woman provided a diversion to allow J\\'onzz to remove the crystal. As he removed the crystal, J\\'onzz was incapacitated by Imperium forces. Batman then covered Wonder Woman and J\\'onzz\\' escape from the plant, but was himself trapped inside and cornered by Imperium forces. J\\'onzz reported that Batman was dead, but in truth, he had mentally shielded Batman to prevent the Imperium forces from detecting him. Batman remained hidden until the Imperium arrived on Earth. He then revealed himself and reversed the ion charge in the Ion Matrix Crystal, causing the plant to burn off the smoke it had been producing. With the sun shining again, the heroes defeated the Imperium and freed their human prisoners, then mopped up the remaining Imperium forces around the globe. Inspired by a general\\'s speech about vigilance and the possible return of the invaders, Batman had the Watchtower constructed by Wayne Enterprises, hiding the funding as a \"line item in the aerospace R&D budget\". Batman invited the other six heroes who had repelled the invaders to the station. The seven heroes formed the Justice League. Claiming he wasn\\'t a \"people person\", Batman did not officially join the League, though he did offer to be on call when the League needed his help. Long considered the brains of the League, Batman often found solutions that eluded the other members. He was quick to place himself in danger, despite the awe-inspiring powers of his teammates. During the Atlantis Usurpation, Batman put a stop to the melting of the Polar Ice Caps. On another occasion, Batman single-handedly defeated five dangerous criminals before being taken prisoner by an Amazon trained criminal. During his time with the League, Batman showed his distrust of Superman. After Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid and when Batman had to pull Superman back later when he attempted to end Darkseid\\'s life, Batman began carrying a piece of Kryptonite, which was revealed when the android Amazo copied Superman\\'s powers. However, Batman still held a deep respect for the Man of Steel, especially after he had seemingly died at the hands of Toyman. But, regardless of his respect, Batman remained stubborn in his disbelief in Superman\\'s death, and refused to mourn for him for quite a while. During the Thanagarian Invasion of Earth, Batman was forced to reveal his identity to his teammates. After successfully retaking the Watchtower from Thanagarian Forces, Batman piloted the Watchtower through the Earth\\'s atmosphere in an attempt to plunge it into a Hyperspace Bypass, a city-wide machine that would generate a wormhole through the Earth. As Batman lost consciousness due to the heat surrounding him, Superman rescued him and as the Watchtower destroyed the Bypass Generator. With the Watchtower\\'s destruction and Hawkgirl \\'s resignation from the League, Batman and the five other members reformed the Justice League with a new Watchtower and an expanded roster of heroes. Batman was instrumental in recruiting Green Arrow into the League, who along with other human league members, helped keep the League from becoming an autonomous Metahuman army. With Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, Batman fought Chronos across time, an adventure during which he met another Batman as well as his older self. He also succeeded in demonstrating to Amanda Waller that Cadmus was being used as a tool to further Lex Luthor\\'s personal agenda to discredit and destroy the Justice League. Amanda Waller was so impressed with Batman that she created Project Batman Beyond to ensure that the world would always have a Batman. Joker\\'s Final Joke After these events, Robin went missing for three weeks while on patrol, with Batman and Batgirl searching for him, until they learned he was at Arkham Asylum . They encounter Joker and Harley Quinn , who reveal that they adopted a son named J.J.(Joker, Jr.), who was actually Robin brainwashed and driven insane. Joker seems to escape, with Batman hot in pursuit. However, he was actually trying to lure Batman into Arkham\\'s Cineplex, where he reveals that he subjected Robin to countless amounts of psychological and physical tortures, and because of this, Joker now knows Batman\\'s true identity, and everything about him. Batman, enraged at the cruelty and torture Joker inflicted onto Robin, smashes through the theater box, and beats Joker down (wrecking the projector in the process, causing Joker to say \"If you don\\'t like the movie, I\\'ve got slides!\"), then hurls Joker down to the room that J.J.\\'s in. Batman threatens to break Joker in half, causing the Joker to retort that he would have done it years ago if he really wanted to do it. Suddenly, The Joker draws a switchblade, and slices Batman\\'s chest, as well as stabs his leg. He then gives what looks like a gun to J.J. and tells him to kill Batman (or, in his words, \"deliver the punchline.\"). J.J. then pulls the trigger, revealing the gun to actually be the infamous \"Bang!\" flag spear gun that is one of the Joker\\'s trademark weapons. J.J. apparently hesitates to kill Batman, causing the Joker to shout \"DO IT!\". Tim reluctantly obliges. Instead of killing Batman however, he instead turns it away at the last second, thus shooting the Joker instead, killing him. J.J. half laughs and half sobs at the events, and Batgirl (having arrived after her fight with Harley Quinn) tries to console him. Commissioner Gordon and Batman later bury the body of Joker in the ruins of Arkham, and Tim is taken to Doctor Leslie Thompkins for rehabilitation. After these events, Batman forbade Tim Drake from ever becoming Robin again. Tim attempted to go solo for a few years, but in the end quit the super-hero life, got married and had children. He broke off contact with Bruce but remained close with Barbara and perhaps Dick. Also, as a result of the fight, Batman walked with a slight limp which in his later years would force him to walk with a cane. Late Adventures Many years passed following the attack of the Joker on the Bat-Family, Bruce entered middle age and began to suffer with a bad heart from the effects of a hard life of crime fighting. Batman developed a powered high tech suit (which had longer Bat ears and minus a cape) that augmented his physical abilities and allowed him to continue the never-ending battle for a few more years. At this time, his corporate rivalry with Derek Powers began, and Wayne Enterprises resisted a hostile bid for corporate takeover. However, injuries suffered through the long decades of physical punishment and an ailing heart finally took their toll, and even the suit couldn\\'t compensate any longer. While attempting to rescue his old friend Veronica Vreeland\\'s daughter Bunny Vreeland from kidnappers, Batman managed to subdue the kidnappers with limited effort until he was forced to point a gun at a common thug to save Ms. Vreeland and his own life after suffering a heart attack while in the midst of the fight. Injured, Batman limps outside the hangar, removing his mask upon realizing he was wielding a handgun, forced to rely on the weapon of his parents\\' cowardly murderer to defend himself against criminals. Ashamed, Bruce returns to the Batcave, where he places the Batsuit in the costume display gallery. Walking to the top of the stairs, Bruce takes one last look at the Batcave and solemnly vows, \"Never again.\" Vowing to never again wear the cowl, Bruce then shuts off the lights, and leaves his past in the darkness. Passing the Mantle of the Bat When he hung up the mantle of the bat, Bruce came a recluse, shut off in Wayne Manor with his dog, Ace. He withdrew from the day to day operations of Wayne Enterprises, a decision that left the company vulnerable to a takeover by Derek Powers and caused Wayne much regret. It was now the year 2039 and Bruce Wayne had become a very old man. Chance brought teen-aged Terry McGinnis to the gates of Wayne Manor, where he learned of Bruce\\'s past secret life. After McGinnis suffered the loss of his father, Bruce reluctantly agreed to allow him to take up mantle of Batman. Bruce then served as a mentor and informant for the successor to his legacy. For years, Bruce coordinated with Terry, supplying advice and direction from the Batcave while McGinnis worked in the field. He also ran the labs and developed new gadgets for Terry to use in the new crusade against crime. The elderly Bruce Wayne occasionally ventured into the field to support Terry. His sense of duty and self-sacrifice ever present, he once donned a suit of Batman armor to rescue Terry from the villain Inque, despite Inque\\'s Metahuman power and the strain produced on Bruce\\'s already damaged heart. As Bruce continued to age, he suffered a kidney failure. When it was discovered that Terry was not just a suitable donor but a perfect one, their relationship reached its weakest point; Terry, like Dick Grayson before him, felt betrayed, manipulated, and outright used. He set off to uncover the truth from someone willing to reveal it. Terry confronted Amanda Waller and learned the truth about his heritage. In her earlier years, Waller realized the world would always need a Batman. Taking fate into her own hands (unbeknownst to Bruce), she gathered a sample of Bruce Wayne\\'s genetic material, after a battle that left Batman in need of medical attention. Using her Cadmus connections, Waller implanted this genetic material into a young Warren McGinnis, replacing his genetic material with Bruce\\'s. Thus, Terry McGinnis was born, the son of Bruce Wayne, sharing half his genetic code. Terry returned to Wayne Manor with a new sense of purpose. Bruce wondered about the fate of Gotham, and Terry replied \"I\\'ve got it covered. Always.\" Their relationship repaired; Bruce had truly become the father Terry had lost long ago. The Savage Timeline In an alternate timeline created by Vandal Savage, the Axis forces won World War II. There, Bruce Wayne lost his parents when they spoke out against the regime and became Batman to fight Savage and his forces. He served as the leader of the resistance movement, recruiting other victims. Unlike his original self, Batman was willing to use guns without a second thought. When the Justice League from the original timeline arrived, Batman helped them escape from the authorities and learned of our timeline. He assisted them in breaking into the facility where the time portal was kept. However, Batman did not accompany the League into the past to thwart Savage, preferring to stay behind and lead the resistance in case they failed. It is assumed that this reality ceased to exist when the League defeated Savage and counteract the Axis powers\\' artificial advantages. Powers and Abilities Through his years of intensive physical training, the Batman represents the peak of human physical conditioning. Batman is at peak human levels of strength, stamina, agility, coordination, reflexes, speed, and durability. Even well into old age, Bruce Wayne still demonstrated that he could manhandle other much younger men with ease. Batman\\'s martial arts discipline was never mentioned, in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Bruce Wayne mentions Ju Jitsu. Batman was also a master of stealth and infiltration (all the more remarkable given that he stands 6\\'2\" and weighs 215 lbs), and often revealed himself to his enemies when they least suspected him to. This also allowed him to just disappear from allies in mid-sentence, a habit that frequently annoyed the likes of Commissioner Gordon (\"one of these days I\\'m gonna nail his feet to the ground\") and Harvey Bullock (\"I wonder how the Commish puts up with that\"). Batman was capable of incredible feats of agility. During the Second Apokolyptian invasion, Darkseid commented with much surprise that Batman had been the first one to dodge his Omega Beams. With his martial arts prowess, occasionally augmented by technology, Batman was usually more than a match for any foe he encountered, human or otherwise. Equipment As the head of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce Wayne has access to cutting edge technology and Batman makes good use of it in his field equipment. Batsuit-standard as well as heat-resistant, cold-resistant, and underwater versions. Batarangs-of differing size and effect. These ranged from standard, to explosive, electric, remote, etc. Grapple-gun. This item assisted Batman in scaling the various buildings of Gotham City. Utility Belt - Batman\\'s Utility Belt has compartments to hold several items, the contents of which change according to his needs, and often include items such as flashlights, laser cutters, underwater rebreathers, binoculars, a fingerprinting kit, flashbangs, remote controls for his vehicles, acid/base compounds, anti-toxins, mini-computer, and smoke pellets. Vehicles Batman has used several vehicles in the course of his crimefighting career, including: Batmobile Batwing Batcycle Batboat Appearances Batman: The Animated Series Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero The New Batman Adventures Superman: The Animated Series Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Batman Beyond Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Justice League Justice League Unlimited Static Shock', 'The Dark Knight General Information Type: Limited Series Total Issues: 4 Published: February – June 1986 Creators: Frank Miller Lynn Varley Batman: The Dark Knight is a four issue mini-series written and drawn by acclaimed author Frank Miller , first published by DC Comics in 1986. Over time the storyarc has been retitled by DC as The Dark Knight Returns in modern trade paperbacks. Contents 1 Sypnosis 2 Issues 3 Publication history 4 Influence 4.1 Comics 4.2 Film 4.3 Animation 4.4 Television 4.5 Video Games Sypnosis The Dark Knight is set in a dystopian near-future version of Gotham City . The year is never specified, though it has been a full decade since the last reported sighting of Batman. Society has lost faith in the functioning of justice, and the current American President, named only Dickard , and whose appearance seems to be a reference to Ronald Reagan, constantly tries to keep the social order with optimistic discourses, while the Cold War is still ongoing. Virtually all superheroes, with the exception of Superman , have been forced by governmental authorities into retirement or otherwise driven away by a distrusting populace. Bruce Wayne has voluntarily retired from crime fighting following the death (under unspecified circumstances) of Jason Todd , the second Robin . In the absence of superheroes, criminals run amok, and a gang called the Mutants terrorize Gotham City. The return of an old enemy prompts a now 55-year-old Wayne to don the Batman costume once again. Despite Wayne\\'s funding his rehabilitation, including plastic surgery to restore his half-disfigured face, Harvey \" Two-Face \" Dent has seemingly returned to crime. Batman apprehends Dent, but the populace debates whether Batman\\'s brand of vigilantism has any place in society. The media plays a large role in DKR , with the narrative broken up by news reports and \"talking head\" editorials debating events in the story as they unfold. After Batman saves her from a Mutant attack, 13-year-old Carrie Kelly buys herself a knock-off Robin costume, and searches for Batman to aid him. She finds Batman at the city dump, where he is fighting the Mutants. The Mutants\\' leader defeats Batman in combat, but Kelly distracts him and pulls Batman into the tank-like Batmobile . Kelly attends to Batman’s wounds as the vehicle drives toward the Batcave . Once home, Batman takes Carrie on as the new Robin despite his butler Alfred\\'s objections. With the help of retiring Commissioner James Gordon , the Mutants\\' leader is allowed to escape from jail, and Batman beats him in a mud fight in front of the assembled gang, which then disbands as a result of his humiliation. Some former Mutants create a new gang, the \"Sons of the Batman,\" using extremely violent methods (up to and including murder) to \"purge\" Gotham of its criminal element in what they see as emulation of Batman\\'s actions. Meanwhile, the return of Batman has caused one of his oldest and deadliest foes, The Joker , to awaken from a years-long catatonic state at Arkham Asylum . The Joker convinces his psychiatrist, Dr. Bartholomew Wolper, that he is sane and regrets his misdeeds. Seeking to discredit Batman, whom he has crusaded against in the media, Wolper appears with the Joker on a late-night show. While the police, now led by the anti-vigilante Commissioner Ellen Yindel , attack Batman, the Joker murders everyone in the television studio (including Wolper) and escapes. Batman and Robin track the Joker to a county fair, where Batman defeats Joker in a violent showdown. Batman stops short of killing the Joker; however, the Joker finishes the job himself, twisting his own broken neck, with the intent that the police will charge Batman with murder. Batman escapes, but not before another confrontation with the Gotham police, and a citywide manhunt is now on for the Caped Crusader. After Superman diverts a Russian nuclear warhead which then detonates in a desert, millions of tons of dust and debris fill the atmosphere, and Gotham descends into chaos during the resulting blackout. Batman and Robin train former Mutants and the brutal Sons of the Batman in non-lethal fighting to stop looting and ensure the flow of needed supplies. In the midst of nuclear winter conditions, Gotham becomes the safest city in America; the U.S. government, seeing this as a credibility-undermining embarrassment, orders Superman to take Batman down. Having been warned of the government\\'s plans by Oliver Queen, the former Green Arrow, Batman confronts Superman. Symbolically, their duel takes place in Crime Alley , where Bruce Wayne\\'s parents were murdered decades earlier. Batman defeats Superman in a well planned fight, but dies from a heart attack immediately afterward. After his funeral, it is revealed that his death was staged as an elaborate ruse; Clark Kent attends the funeral and gives Robin a knowing wink after hearing Bruce\\'s heartbeat as he leaves the grave site, suggesting his silent approval of what will happen next. Alfred destroys the Batcave and Wayne Manor and suffers a fatal stroke. Some time afterward, Batman leads Robin, Green Arrow, and the rest of his followers into the caverns beyond the Batcave and prepares to continue his fight. His plan, which will take years of training and studying, is to build an army, and to bring sense to a world plagued by something \"worse than thieves and murderers\". He decides that this will be a good life — good enough. Issues The Dark Knight Returns The Dark Knight Triumphant Hunt the Dark Knight The Dark Knight Falls Publication history The original indicia of each issue states that the series was titled Batman: The Dark Knight . Several early collected editions also left out the words Returns from the cover title. Influence Comics Batman: The Dark Knight is often heralded as one of the biggest influences on the Modern Age of Comic Books , alongside Alan Moore \\'s Watchmen . The series notably revitalized interest in Batman, which had been waning since the 1970s. Although not the first Batman work to implement a darker tone, the series helped popularize grimmer takes on the character and move away from light-hearted approaches, which were heavily associated with him due to the popularity of the 1960s series . Elements of Batman\\'s costumes, specifically short ears on the cowl and pouch-based Utility Belt , would be adapted into other variations and artists\\' designs. The evaluation of the character\\'s psychology would be in other works, including Grant Morrison \\'s Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth . Original characters from the series, such as Carrie Kelley and the Mutants , have also appeared in the main-continuities and other depictions. Several art pieces from the series, notably Batman crouching on a line , have appeared throughout the franchise and promotional work. Plot points from the series would also make it into DC\\'s New Earth and Prime Earth, notably the death of Jason Todd . Several moments of Batman\\'s origin, notably discovering the Batcave as a child and the pearls falling from his mother\\'s neck, also originate from the series. The Exoframe Batsuit used in the battle with Superman has also inspired other armors used by Batman to fight superpowered enemies, such as the Thrasher Suit and Justice Buster Batsuit . Elements of the story have also appeared in works related to Superman and Green Arrow . Film Tim Burton , director of the 1989 Batman film and Batman Returns , cited Batman: The Dark Knight as great influence on his works with the character. Joel Schumacher had also pitched a live-action adaptation of the series to Warner Bros. after finishing Batman Forever and the later cancelation of Batman Unchained . However, both times had the proposal shelved in favor of both Batman & Robin and Batman: DarKnight , respectively. Christopher Nolan \\'s would take several influences from Miller\\'s Batman: The Dark Knight . The most consistent over the films including the Tumbler (the films\\' version of the Batmobile ) being a large military vehicle intended for warfare like the Riot Tank Batmobile used in the comic. The second film, The Dark Knight , also features a group of vigilante copycats similar to the Sons of Batman . The third film in the trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises , takes the most influence from the series and even lifts several plotlines. The most notable include a retired Batman returning to fight crime after years of absence, the GCPD learning of it when he intervenes in a car chase, his confrontations with Bane mirroring both fights with the Mutant Leader , and Bruce Wayne faking his death to find a life away from the cowl. Batman also uses a Mechanized Leg Brace to enhance his strength, having lost much of it over years of retirement. The 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice also took heavy influence from The Dark Knight comic series, even featuring many visual and dialogue references to the series. The film\\'s depiction of Batman also takes influence from the series\\' version, including the character being at middle-age, wearing a similar Batsuit design , and being depicted as more brutal and willing to use lethal force. The film also takes pieces of dialogue and moments are directly lifted from the series, most notably Alfred \\'s concerns about the lack of future Wayne generations, Superman being weakened by a nuclear weapon\\'s detonation, and the hostage situation from The Dark Knight Triumphant (though the film switches the toddler with Martha Kent and shows a decisively lethal outcome for the captor). The fight with Superman also takes many elements of the climax, such as Batman using an heavily-armored Batsuit , using ultra-sonic weaponry to cause a sensory overload, and using Kryptonite gas to weaken his opponent. The 2019 film Joker also lifts the talk-show scene from the comic, with its host Murray Franklin being based on David Endocrine . The Riot Tank Batmobile also appears in new material filmed for scene for the director\\'s cut of Justice League , appearing in the \"Knightmare\" post-credits scene. Animation The New Batman Adventures would adapt the second issue ( The Dark Knight Triumphant ) as a segment in the episode \" Legends of the Dark Knight \". However, the story was heavily condensed and the segment removes several moments to retain a family audience, such as Batman shooting a member of the mutants and the initial encounter with the Mutant Leader. In The Batman animated series episode \" Artifacts \", a future version of the series\\' Batman bares a muscular similar to the comic\\'s version, such as the muscular design, larger bat-symbol and use of strength-enhancing technology. The Batman: The Brave and the Bold also pays homage to The Dark Knight Returns in the episode \" The Rise of the Blue Beetle! \", with the cover appearing as a poster on Jamie Reyes\\' bedroom wall. The entire series was adapted into an animated feature directed by Jay Oliva and released in two parts from September, 2012 to January, 2013. A combination of the two was released on October 2013. Television In the TV series Gotham , the episode \" The Gentle Art of Making Enemies \" has a confrontation between Bruce Wayne and Jerome Valeska (the series\\' first incarnation of the Joker) take place in a Hall of Mirrors. The comic\\'s depiction of the Joker was also used as influence for Jerome\\'s brother Jeremiah Valeska , such as him being render catatonic and returning after Bruce\\'s return ten years later. The Arrowverse also features a version of Batman based on the comic\\'s version of the character, with references to antagonism with Superman and dialogue lifted straight from the series\\' climax. Video Games The video game Batman: Arkham Knight features a version of the Batmobile that can turn into a riot-response tank similar to the series\\' version of the vehicle. The game implies the design was chosen due to something darker taking control of his psyche and influencing him to implement these. However, the riot-tank features of the Batmobile are decisively non-lethal, whereas the comic\\'s is implied to be capable of deadly force but never used.'],\n",
      "    response='The hero in the Batman series is Bruce Wayne, a billionaire philanthropist who becomes Batman after witnessing the murder of his parents as a child.

      "    reasoning=\"Based on the conversation history, which is empty, and the current question about Batman's first appearance, I reviewed the provided context passages. These passages primarily discuss Batman in various media adaptations, such as the 1960s TV series with Adam West (context [2]), animated series, and films, but they do not explicitly state the original debut date. However, the student's goal is to learn about the historical origins of Batman, indicating an interest in his foundational comic book appearance rather than later adaptations. The pragmatic need calls for a clear, factual response to satisfy curiosity without overwhelming details. Drawing from the implicit historical context in the passages (e.g., references to Batman's early iterations in [5]), and aligning with standard knowledge of Batman's creation, I infer that the first appearance refers to Detective Comics #27 in 1939.

He acted out the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman in the Batman television series of the late 1960s and its various spinoffs. A victim of typecasting , West remerged to voice other versions of Batman with 1977\\'s The New Adventures of Batman and the Super Friends cartoons of the mid-1980s. Years later West was invited to voice Simon Trent/The Gray Ghost in Batman: The Animated Series . In his later years, he also cameoed as Marion Grange in The Batman , and provided the voice of Thomas Wayne , Bruce Wayne\\'s father, in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold installment \" Chill of the Night! \" Following a brief battle with leukemia, West died in the summer of 2017 at the age of 88.

He played opposite Chuck Connors in Geronimo (1962) and Joe DeRita in The Outlaws Is Coming (1965). He also appeared in the science fiction film, Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964) alongside Paul Mantee, and, unsurprisingly, achieved continuing success for the title role in the 1960s ABC series Batman and its theatrical feature film. West was contacted for a screen test after William Dozier saw West perform as the James Bond-like spy Captain Q in a Nestlé Quik television ad. West was in competition with Lyle Waggoner (who later acted out Steve Trevor and, later, his lookalike son Steve Trevor Jr. in the 1970s television version of Wonder Woman which starred Lynda Carter in the title role) for the Batman role. West became the third actor to play Bruce Wayne/Batman in live action, succeeding Robert Lowery . The popular show, which was deliberately produced as a lampoon comedy but drew accusations of being \"campy\" that bothered West throughout his entire career, ran on ABC from 1966 to 1968; a film version was released in July of 1966. At this time, the DC Comics that were featuring Batman himself were experiencing dismal sales, and were threatened with cancellation after approximately twenty-five years; West, when he dictated his autobiography, Back To The Batcave, to Jeff Rovin, pointed out that the \"Batuation comedy\" saved Batman\\'s DC Comics from cancellation and enabled a new generation to get to know the character as he had originally been created. Return Performances as Batman West often reprised his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, first in the short-lived animated series The New Adventures of Batman and later in other shows such as The Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour, Tarzan and the Super 7, Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show, and The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians; he succeeded Olan Soule in this last role. In 1979, West once again donned the Bat-Costume for the live-action TV special Legends of the Superheroes . In 1985, DC Comics named West as one of the honorees in the company\\'s 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great for his work on the Batman series. In 1997 West returned to the Role of Bruce Wayne/Batman for the first time in 12 years for the animated short \"Boo Wonder\" on the animated TV series Animaniacs. In one installment of Batman: The Animated Series, he provided the character voice of an actor whose career had stalled due to typecasting as a Batman-like character called \"The Gray Ghost.\" (See below.) In 2016, and again in 2017, West returned to voice Batman in two animated features, Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders and Batman vs Two Face! Both animated features were based on the original 1960s TV series. The latter was released posthumously and proved to be West\\'s final work; deathly ill with leukemia during the recording sessions for Batman Versus Two-Face! though he worked through his illness, he died between his having finished recording all his dialog and the film\\'s release. 1992 Installment: Simon Trent West provided a character voice for a 1992 installment of Batman: The Animated Series on Fox, but NOT that of Batman, since the character voice of Batman was already being provided by Kevin Conroy . Instead, he provided the character voice of Simon Trent , an out-of-work actor who had once acted out a super-hero similar to Batman himself in a TV series called The Gray Ghost, and who was now considered a washed-up had-been as far as motion pictures and television went; he now had a great deal of difficulty finding acting work due to typecasting. The producers nearly considered scrapping that installment as they figured it mirrored Adam West too much; however, West had already made his peace with his public identification as Batman, and he gladly accepted voicing such a character. Mayor Grange Voice West later had a recurring role as the voice of Mayor Grange in the WB animated series The Batman . CGI File: Batman The actor vocally reprised his role as Batman for the CGI animated short film Batman: New Times . He co-starred with Mark Hamill , who vocally portrayed the Joker and had originally played the role on Batman: The Animated Series. West also voiced Thomas Wayne , Bruce Wayne\\'s father, in an episode of the cartoon series Batman: The Brave and the Bold . In the same series, he played Batman\\'s prototype robot, aptly named \"Protobot,\" or \"Proto\" for short. He also did voice work on animated series such as The Fairly OddParents and Family Guy, in both of which he voiced fictional versions of himself. In comics BlueWater Comics published The Mis-Adventures of Adam West, which told the adventures of West in various movie parodies where he, a classic hero type who rejected the darkening nature of heroes in films, would always save the day. Throughout the series, he would appear in Gotham City, and certain iconic Batman moments would be redrawn with West as Batman.

The Batman vs. Dracula The Batman is a masked vigilante and the hero of Gotham City . Batman is the secret identity of billionaire Bruce Wayne , the CEO of Wayne Enterprises, who, after witnessing the death of his parents, vowed to spend the rest of his life warring on all criminals. He is a founding member of the Justice League . Contents 1 History 2 Appearance 3 Powers and Abilities 4 Paraphernalia 4.1 Equipment 4.2 Transportation 4.3 Weapons 4.4 Batsuits 5 Appearances 6 Trivia 7 Voiced by History Bruce Wayne was born a child of wealth and privilege to Thomas and Martha Wayne of Gotham City. As the Waynes\\' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father\\'s business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler, Alfred Pennyworth , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents\\' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City. As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named Ethan Bennett . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\". As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents\\' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot. For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman\\'s activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police Angel Rojas took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named Ellen Yin , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham. In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date – the Joker . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes. The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham\\'s underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named Bane . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of the Penguin , Man-Bat , Killer Croc , Cluemaster and Catwoman . One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce\\'s career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface. Some time later, a new character entered the Batman\\'s life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally. Barbara Gordon , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordan , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend Poison Ivy from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara\\'s aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt. The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist Dick Grayson was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named Tony Zucco . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick\\'s acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force. Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself John Jones . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called the Joining . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth\\'s atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John\\'s behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as Lex Luthor . At some point later, in the year 2027, Mr. Freeze had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named Nightwing . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever. One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave\\'s titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman\\'s legacy survived into the future. Appearance Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights. He also wears a dark gray costume with a black bat-emblem, black trunks, gloves, and knee high boots. Powers and Abilities Master Acrobat: Excellent in gymnastics and acrobatics.

His personal favourite was the Gray Ghost , watching the television show with his father. On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to Wonder Woman , Bruce hadn\\'t been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes\\' faithful friend and butler, Alfred Pennyworth Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from Yoru Sensei . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor\\'s daughter Zatanna became very close. As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with Andrea Beaumont . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\". War on Crime Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the Batcave . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city\\'s underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in Dick Grayson as his ward after witnessing his parents\\' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down their murderer . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and Commissioner James Gordon , working with them to control crime in Gotham. Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included the Penguin , Poison Ivy , Mr. Freeze and the Scarecrow . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including Catwoman and Two-Face . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered the Joker , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created. New Adventures Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as Batwoman . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called Batgirl began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father\\'s legacy as the next Police Commissioner. Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned Tim Drake from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder. Joining Up For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called Blüdhaven . Batman would later find himself in Metropolis , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with Lex Luthor , Batman would find himself working with Superman to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker\\'s plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue\\'s gallery. He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another\\'s home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity. Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper. It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world\\'s greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League. Saving the World Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech\\'s deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station\\'s antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J\\'onn J\\'onzz\\' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna\\'s destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch. Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman\\'s mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don\\'t even think about it\". When the Imperium\\'s attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation. Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J\\'onn J\\'onzz. After freeing J\\'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J\\'onn J\\'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of Wonder Woman . The Flash arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing\\'s severed wing. After J\\'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium\\'s invasion of Mars , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium\\'s factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun\\'s rays. The heroes split up to disable the factories. Batman went to Giza, Egypt with Wonder Woman and J\\'onn J\\'onzz. The trio infiltrated the factory and found the Ion Matrix Crystal, a vital component of the plant. Batman and Wonder Woman provided a diversion to allow J\\'onzz to remove the crystal. As he removed the crystal, J\\'onzz was incapacitated by Imperium forces. Batman then covered Wonder Woman and J\\'onzz\\' escape from the plant, but was himself trapped inside and cornered by Imperium forces. J\\'onzz reported that Batman was dead, but in truth, he had mentally shielded Batman to prevent the Imperium forces from detecting him. Batman remained hidden until the Imperium arrived on Earth. He then revealed himself and reversed the ion charge in the Ion Matrix Crystal, causing the plant to burn off the smoke it had been producing. With the sun shining again, the heroes defeated the Imperium and freed their human prisoners, then mopped up the remaining Imperium forces around the globe. Inspired by a general\\'s speech about vigilance and the possible return of the invaders, Batman had the Watchtower constructed by Wayne Enterprises, hiding the funding as a \"line item in the aerospace R&D budget\". Batman invited the other six heroes who had repelled the invaders to the station. The seven heroes formed the Justice League. Claiming he wasn\\'t a \"people person\", Batman did not officially join the League, though he did offer to be on call when the League needed his help. Long considered the brains of the League, Batman often found solutions that eluded the other members. He was quick to place himself in danger, despite the awe-inspiring powers of his teammates. During the Atlantis Usurpation, Batman put a stop to the melting of the Polar Ice Caps. On another occasion, Batman single-handedly defeated five dangerous criminals before being taken prisoner by an Amazon trained criminal. During his time with the League, Batman showed his distrust of Superman. After Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid and when Batman had to pull Superman back later when he attempted to end Darkseid\\'s life, Batman began carrying a piece of Kryptonite, which was revealed when the android Amazo copied Superman\\'s powers. However, Batman still held a deep respect for the Man of Steel, especially after he had seemingly died at the hands of Toyman. But, regardless of his respect, Batman remained stubborn in his disbelief in Superman\\'s death, and refused to mourn for him for quite a while. During the Thanagarian Invasion of Earth, Batman was forced to reveal his identity to his teammates. After successfully retaking the Watchtower from Thanagarian Forces, Batman piloted the Watchtower through the Earth\\'s atmosphere in an attempt to plunge it into a Hyperspace Bypass, a city-wide machine that would generate a wormhole through the Earth. As Batman lost consciousness due to the heat surrounding him, Superman rescued him and as the Watchtower destroyed the Bypass Generator. With the Watchtower\\'s destruction and Hawkgirl \\'s resignation from the League, Batman and the five other members reformed the Justice League with a new Watchtower and an expanded roster of heroes. Batman was instrumental in recruiting Green Arrow into the League, who along with other human league members, helped keep the League from becoming an autonomous Metahuman army. With Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, Batman fought Chronos across time, an adventure during which he met another Batman as well as his older self. He also succeeded in demonstrating to Amanda Waller that Cadmus was being used as a tool to further Lex Luthor\\'s personal agenda to discredit and destroy the Justice League. Amanda Waller was so impressed with Batman that she created Project Batman Beyond to ensure that the world would always have a Batman. Joker\\'s Final Joke After these events, Robin went missing for three weeks while on patrol, with Batman and Batgirl searching for him, until they learned he was at Arkham Asylum . They encounter Joker and Harley Quinn , who reveal that they adopted a son named J.J.(Joker, Jr.), who was actually Robin brainwashed and driven insane. Joker seems to escape, with Batman hot in pursuit. However, he was actually trying to lure Batman into Arkham\\'s Cineplex, where he reveals that he subjected Robin to countless amounts of psychological and physical tortures, and because of this, Joker now knows Batman\\'s true identity, and everything about him. Batman, enraged at the cruelty and torture Joker inflicted onto Robin, smashes through the theater box, and beats Joker down (wrecking the projector in the process, causing Joker to say \"If you don\\'t like the movie, I\\'ve got slides!\"), then hurls Joker down to the room that J.J.\\'s in. Batman threatens to break Joker in half, causing the Joker to retort that he would have done it years ago if he really wanted to do it. Suddenly, The Joker draws a switchblade, and slices Batman\\'s chest, as well as stabs his leg. He then gives what looks like a gun to J.J. and tells him to kill Batman (or, in his words, \"deliver the punchline.\"). J.J. then pulls the trigger, revealing the gun to actually be the infamous \"Bang!\" flag spear gun that is one of the Joker\\'s trademark weapons. J.J. apparently hesitates to kill Batman, causing the Joker to shout \"DO IT!\". Tim reluctantly obliges. Instead of killing Batman however, he instead turns it away at the last second, thus shooting the Joker instead, killing him. J.J. half laughs and half sobs at the events, and Batgirl (having arrived after her fight with Harley Quinn) tries to console him. Commissioner Gordon and Batman later bury the body of Joker in the ruins of Arkham, and Tim is taken to Doctor Leslie Thompkins for rehabilitation. After these events, Batman forbade Tim Drake from ever becoming Robin again. Tim attempted to go solo for a few years, but in the end quit the super-hero life, got married and had children. He broke off contact with Bruce but remained close with Barbara and perhaps Dick. Also, as a result of the fight, Batman walked with a slight limp which in his later years would force him to walk with a cane. Late Adventures Many years passed following the attack of the Joker on the Bat-Family, Bruce entered middle age and began to suffer with a bad heart from the effects of a hard life of crime fighting. Batman developed a powered high tech suit (which had longer Bat ears and minus a cape) that augmented his physical abilities and allowed him to continue the never-ending battle for a few more years. At this time, his corporate rivalry with Derek Powers began, and Wayne Enterprises resisted a hostile bid for corporate takeover. However, injuries suffered through the long decades of physical punishment and an ailing heart finally took their toll, and even the suit couldn\\'t compensate any longer. While attempting to rescue his old friend Veronica Vreeland\\'s daughter Bunny Vreeland from kidnappers, Batman managed to subdue the kidnappers with limited effort until he was forced to point a gun at a common thug to save Ms. Vreeland and his own life after suffering a heart attack while in the midst of the fight. Injured, Batman limps outside the hangar, removing his mask upon realizing he was wielding a handgun, forced to rely on the weapon of his parents\\' cowardly murderer to defend himself against criminals. Ashamed, Bruce returns to the Batcave, where he places the Batsuit in the costume display gallery. Walking to the top of the stairs, Bruce takes one last look at the Batcave and solemnly vows, \"Never again.\" Vowing to never again wear the cowl, Bruce then shuts off the lights, and leaves his past in the darkness. Passing the Mantle of the Bat When he hung up the mantle of the bat, Bruce came a recluse, shut off in Wayne Manor with his dog, Ace. He withdrew from the day to day operations of Wayne Enterprises, a decision that left the company vulnerable to a takeover by Derek Powers and caused Wayne much regret. It was now the year 2039 and Bruce Wayne had become a very old man. Chance brought teen-aged Terry McGinnis to the gates of Wayne Manor, where he learned of Bruce\\'s past secret life. After McGinnis suffered the loss of his father, Bruce reluctantly agreed to allow him to take up mantle of Batman. Bruce then served as a mentor and informant for the successor to his legacy. For years, Bruce coordinated with Terry, supplying advice and direction from the Batcave while McGinnis worked in the field. He also ran the labs and developed new gadgets for Terry to use in the new crusade against crime. The elderly Bruce Wayne occasionally ventured into the field to support Terry. His sense of duty and self-sacrifice ever present, he once donned a suit of Batman armor to rescue Terry from the villain Inque, despite Inque\\'s Metahuman power and the strain produced on Bruce\\'s already damaged heart. As Bruce continued to age, he suffered a kidney failure. When it was discovered that Terry was not just a suitable donor but a perfect one, their relationship reached its weakest point; Terry, like Dick Grayson before him, felt betrayed, manipulated, and outright used. He set off to uncover the truth from someone willing to reveal it. Terry confronted Amanda Waller and learned the truth about his heritage. In her earlier years, Waller realized the world would always need a Batman. Taking fate into her own hands (unbeknownst to Bruce), she gathered a sample of Bruce Wayne\\'s genetic material, after a battle that left Batman in need of medical attention. Using her Cadmus connections, Waller implanted this genetic material into a young Warren McGinnis, replacing his genetic material with Bruce\\'s. Thus, Terry McGinnis was born, the son of Bruce Wayne, sharing half his genetic code. Terry returned to Wayne Manor with a new sense of purpose. Bruce wondered about the fate of Gotham, and Terry replied \"I\\'ve got it covered. Always.\" Their relationship repaired; Bruce had truly become the father Terry had lost long ago. The Savage Timeline In an alternate timeline created by Vandal Savage, the Axis forces won World War II. There, Bruce Wayne lost his parents when they spoke out against the regime and became Batman to fight Savage and his forces. He served as the leader of the resistance movement, recruiting other victims. Unlike his original self, Batman was willing to use guns without a second thought. When the Justice League from the original timeline arrived, Batman helped them escape from the authorities and learned of our timeline. He assisted them in breaking into the facility where the time portal was kept. However, Batman did not accompany the League into the past to thwart Savage, preferring to stay behind and lead the resistance in case they failed. It is assumed that this reality ceased to exist when the League defeated Savage and counteract the Axis powers\\' artificial advantages. Powers and Abilities Through his years of intensive physical training, the Batman represents the peak of human physical conditioning. Batman is at peak human levels of strength, stamina, agility, coordination, reflexes, speed, and durability. Even well into old age, Bruce Wayne still demonstrated that he could manhandle other much younger men with ease. Batman\\'s martial arts discipline was never mentioned, in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Bruce Wayne mentions Ju Jitsu. Batman was also a master of stealth and infiltration (all the more remarkable given that he stands 6\\'2\" and weighs 215 lbs), and often revealed himself to his enemies when they least suspected him to. This also allowed him to just disappear from allies in mid-sentence, a habit that frequently annoyed the likes of Commissioner Gordon (\"one of these days I\\'m gonna nail his feet to the ground\") and Harvey Bullock (\"I wonder how the Commish puts up with that\"). Batman was capable of incredible feats of agility. During the Second Apokolyptian invasion, Darkseid commented with much surprise that Batman had been the first one to dodge his Omega Beams. With his martial arts prowess, occasionally augmented by technology, Batman was usually more than a match for any foe he encountered, human or otherwise. Equipment As the head of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce Wayne has access to cutting edge technology and Batman makes good use of it in his field equipment. Batsuit-standard as well as heat-resistant, cold-resistant, and underwater versions. Batarangs-of differing size and effect. These ranged from standard, to explosive, electric, remote, etc. Grapple-gun. This item assisted Batman in scaling the various buildings of Gotham City. Utility Belt - Batman\\'s Utility Belt has compartments to hold several items, the contents of which change according to his needs, and often include items such as flashlights, laser cutters, underwater rebreathers, binoculars, a fingerprinting kit, flashbangs, remote controls for his vehicles, acid/base compounds, anti-toxins, mini-computer, and smoke pellets. Vehicles Batman has used several vehicles in the course of his crimefighting career, including: Batmobile Batwing Batcycle Batboat Appearances Batman: The Animated Series Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero The New Batman Adventures Superman: The Animated Series Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Batman Beyond Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Justice League Justice League Unlimited Static Shock'],\n",

Robert Pattinson has been selected as the new new Bruce Wayne of this series. The film will feature members of the rogues gallery, including Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman, Paul Dano as the Riddler and Colin Farrell as the Penguin.

DC Films Multiverse Team-Ups and Crossover Event Films Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice was released on March 25, 2016, directed by Zack Snyder . A follow up to Man of Steel , the film features Ben Affleck as Batman and intended to launch a shared universe that would last indefinitely. Batman v. Superman follows Batman and Superman as they are brought into conflict by criminal mastermind Lex Luthor . Despite being a commercial success, the film received negative reviews, though the Rescuing Martha fight scene toward the end of the film was met with near universal praise from Batman fans. A three hour extended cut was released on home video. Suicide Squad Suicide Squad was released on August 5 2016 and directed by David Ayer. The film features Amanda Waller as she puts together a team of supervillains to perform tasks the government can\\'t, lead by Rick Flag . Members of Batman\\'s rogues gallery, such as Deadshot , Harley Quinn and Killer Croc , are prominently featured as members of the titular team. Affleck returns as Batman in several scenes and the Joker is also featured as a secondary antagonist. Like Batman v. Superman , the film received negatively, but was financially successful.

Affleck reprises his role as Batman from Batman v. Superman and Suicide Squad . The film follows him teaming up with Wonder Woman , the Flash , Aquaman and Cyborg to fight Steppenwolf and the forces of Apokolips, after the apparent death of Superman.

Robbie, Davis and Kinnaman will return as Quinn, Waller and Flag, respectively. The film will also feature several other Batman villains, including Polka-Dot Man and the Ratcatcher . The Flash Andy Muschietti will direct a Flash movie centering on Ezra Miller that will introduce the concept of a cinematic \"Multiverse.\" A retcon that would unite previous incarnations of the Batman film franchise. Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck will return as their versions of the character. Producer Barbara Muschietti promised that film would \"change everything, but doesn\\'t forget anything\" at the DC FanDome . Walter Hamada intends the film as way of refreshing their approach and correct the mistakes of the recent past. Villain Spinoff Films Catwoman Catwoman was released on July 23, 2004 and stars Halle Berry as Patience Phillips , where this version of Catwoman is a a shy, timid artist that gained cat like powers. Auteur French filmmaker Pitof directed the standalone movie. The film was panned by critics and was a box office bomb only grossing $82 million. The film intended to link itself to the previous series by placing a photo of Michelle Pfeiffer in a scene suggesting that all previous live-action depictions exist within the same reality. This was before legal issues regarding the television show were sorted in 2013, so no photos from the live-action series could be used by WB. Joker Joker was released on October 4, 2019 and was directed by Todd Phillips. Joaquin Phoenix stars as Arthur Fleck , a struggling comedian suffering with his mental health. The film is set in an 1980s Gotham City and tells a possible origin story for the Joker. The film was overwhelmingly financially successful and received positively, many praising Phoenix\\'s performance and willingness to move away from the comics. However, some social commenters were concerned it may inspire real-world violence. Phoenix won an Oscar for the film which makes him the second actor to win an Oscar after Ledger in The Dark Knight and the fourth Joker actor to win an Oscar.', 'Batman Unchained General Information Directed by Joel Schumacher Written by Mark Protosevich Music by Elliot Goldenthal Previous Film Batman & Robin Batman Unchained was the planned sequel to Batman & Robin being written by Mark Protosevich under the direction of Joel Schumacher . It was cancelled after the negative reception of Batman & Robin . Some themes and imagery from this script were later used in Batman Begins . Contents 1 Cast 2 Production 3 Impact on further screenplays 4 Trivia 5 Links Cast George Clooney as Bruce Wayne/Batman Chris O\\'Donnell as Dick Grayson/Robin Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl/Barbara Wilson Nicolas Cage as Dr. Jonathan Crane/The Scarecrow (role offered) Courtney Love as Harley Quinn (actress never hired) Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon (expected) Jack Nicholson , Danny DeVito , Michelle Pfeiffer , Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey as Joker , Penguin , Catwoman , Two-Face and the Riddler respectively (they would return in Batman\\'s mind as a result of the Scarecrow\\'s fear toxins) Production During the filming of Batman & Robin , Warner Bros. was impressed with the dailies. This prompted them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to return as director for a fifth film, but writer Akiva Goldsman , who worked on Batman Forever and Batman & Robin with Schumacher, turned down the chance to write the script. In late 1996, Warner Bros. and Schumacher hired Mark Protosevich to write the script for a fifth Batman film. A projected mid-1999 release date was announced. Titled Batman Unchained , Protosevich\\'s script had the Scarecrow as the main villain and it would bring back the franchise in a more serious and darker direction, unlike the previous two films. The script dealt with Batman learning to conquer fear and to confront the demons of his past. The Joker would return as a hallucination in Batman\\'s mind caused by the Scarecrow\\'s fear toxin, along with Penguin , Catwoman , Two-Face and the Riddler , all together to judge the hero on trial. Harley Quinn appeared as a toymaker, written as the Joker\\'s daughter trying to get revenge on Batman for the Joker\\'s death. Crane discovers Batman\\'s identity and forms an alliance with Harley to lead him to madness and lock him in Arkham Asylum . In the script, Robin abandons Batman for disagreements, but he returns during the final battle to help his mentor. After defeating his enemies and his demons, Bruce makes a trip to Bali and enters a cave full of bats, with them flying around him, as a proof for having conquered his fears. George Clooney and Chris O\\'Donnell were set to reprise the roles of Batman and Robin , respectively. Schumacher offered the part of the Scarecrow to Nicolas Cage while filming Face/Off and Courtney Love was proposed for the role of Harley. However, when Batman & Robin received negative reviews and failed to outgross any of its predecessors on its release, the idea was to continue the big budget spectacle but Warner Bros. were unsure of their plans for Batman Unchained and George Clooney vowed never to wear the cape and cowl again. Director of the previous two films Joel Schumacher claimed that he turned down the chance to return stating that he lost his \"passion\" for Batman in film and didn\\'t want to turn the passion into just a job. In reality it seemed the studio was unwilling to to gamble on his vision. In the aftermath producer Peter MacGregor-Scott was relegated to making OnStar commercials featuring Bruce Thomas as Batman . Surviving costume pieces like Clooney\\'s Batsuit and Kilmer\\'s Cowl as well as the Batcave set were re-used in the television spots. The studio favored bringing back the Michael Keaton Batmobile and Danny Elfman theme to distance them from the Schumacher ephemera. Impact on further screenplays WB executive Greg Silverman was tasked with helping develop a new script featuring Scarecrow by Lee Shapiro and Stephen Wise, called Batman: DarKnight . The new approach to a fifth movie focused on more physiological nuance and building a more subtle dark atmosphere, keeping the budget more reasonable to address criticisms of the previous movie. Ultimately the studio decided it was best to consider something completely different rather a fifth sequel. A live-action Batman Beyond film and an adaptation of Frank Miller \\'s Batman: Year One were both developed. Warner Bros. would hire Darren Aronofsky to direct Year One . Realizing it had deviated so far from the source material it was abandoned as well. Christopher Nolan pitched a similar take in 2003 which resulted in Batman Begins , the final film features numerous influences from both scripts for the fifth movie using Scarecrow. Trivia The 2015 video game Batman: Arkham Knight seems to indirectly draw some inspiration from the unused script to Batman Unchained , as the game features Scarecrow as the main villain and the Joker appearing to Batman in hallucinations. DC Movies Wikia Page', 'Batman: Year One General Information Type: Limited series Total Issues: 4 Published: March - June 1987 Creators: Frank Miller David Mazzucchelli Batman: Year One is the title of a Batman comic written by Frank Miller , illustrated by David Mazzucchelli and colored by Richmond Lewis .. It originally appeared in issues #404 to #407 of DC \\'s Batman comic title in 1987. It is one of the first examples of the \"limited series within a series\" format that is now prevalent in American comic books. There have been several reprints of the story: a hardcover, multiple trade paperback editions (one in standard comics paper with simpler coloring and one deluxe version with rich detailing in the colors and both colored by Richmond Lewis) and it has been included in The Complete Frank Miller Batman hardcover. Contents 1 Synopsis 2 Issues 3 Continuity 4 Film adaptation 4.1 Development 4.2 Plot 5 References to other media 6 References in other works 7 Parodies Synopsis The story recounts the beginning of Bruce Wayne\\'s career as Batman and James Gordon \\'s with the Gotham City Police Department. Bruce Wayne, aged 25, returns home from training abroad in martial arts, manhunting and science for nearly twelve years. In Gotham, he bides his time, waiting for the right moment to strike, all the while preparing himself. Gordon, meanwhile, has moved to Gotham from Chicago with his pregnant wife, Barbara Kean-Gordon, and pursues a career in law enforcement. His first time out patrolling reveals to him the disturbing nature of law enforcement in Gotham as a senior officer, Detective Flass , assaults an unsuspecting teenager for \"staying out late\". Gordon is disgusted with his partner\\'s behavior towards all the \"offenders\" Jim feels that he has to straighten things out. Bruce makes preparations - registering at a hotel to provide an alibi, giving himself a fake scar to disguise himself - before going out for his first street mission. He enters the Red Light District of Gotham. A young prostitute named Holly Robinson tries to proposition him. Her pimp, angry because he knows Bruce isn\\'t the type to hire prostitutes, forcefully drags her away. Bruce confronts him and gets into a fight, and a few others join in. Selina Kyle , a dominatrix in the slums of Gotham, jumps from her window and fights with Bruce; he is stabbed in the thigh by Holly. The police arrive on the scene, shoot Bruce and then throw him into the back seat of their car. On the way to the station, he manages to escape by causing the corrupt officers to wreck their squad car. After pulling the unconscious officers out of the car Bruce returns home, bleeding from his various wounds. There he sits, looking for inspiration, something he feels will strike fear into the hearts of criminals. A bat crashes into the room through a window and perches on a sculpture of his father, to which Bruce immediately responds. He has found what he is looking for, stating the words \"Yes Father, I will become a bat.\" Gordon tries to clean up GCPD, but on the orders of the corrupt Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb , is attacked and threatened by fellow officers. After recovering, he visits the house of one of these officers, where they have gathered to play poker. He waits for Detective Flass, who he knows is responsible for organizing the attack. Flass is the last to leave, and Gordon tails him into the woods, where he proceeds to attack the drunken officer. Bruce goes out for the first time as Batman and stops a trio of teenagers from stealing a television. A brief struggle ensues, resulting in the Dark Knight\\'s first victory. The legend quickly grows with Batman attacking criminals with increasing boldness, including Flass, who was present at one crime, receiving a pay off from the criminals. One night, when the corrupt city leaders and gangsters like Carmine Falcone gather for a dinner party, Commissioner Loeb explains why Batman is politically advantageous to themselves, assuming he would never bother them; meanwhile, Batman sneaks onto the grounds, puts the guards to sleep and sets up stage lights around the window that comprises one of the dining room walls. He cuts the electricity, throwing the room in darkness, blows a hole in the outside wall and then activates the lights. He gives the men and women a dire warning that he is just as determined to deliver them to justice as well, then leaves. Meanwhile, Selina Kyle is inspired to become a costumed cat burglar when she sees Batman in action and becomes Catwoman . The police try to capture Batman numerous times, but Bruce is too elusive and alert to fall for their traps. In addition, the maverick district attorney, Harvey Dent , becomes Batman\\'s secret ally. After a night of following useless leads, Gordon and his partner, Detective Sarah Essen , see a truck barreling down the street. They give chase and Gordon hands the wheel over to Essen as he tries to get into the vehicle. An old, homeless woman stands in the way of the truck and is about to be run over just as soon as Batman jumps in and shoves her out of the way. The bus runs into a wall and Gordon briefly blacks out, only to awake moments later and find Essen holding Batman at gunpoint. She is momentarily distracted when she turns to ask if he is all right and Batman takes advantage to disarm her and flee into an abandoned building. When cops arrive on the scene, the commissioner is quick to call in the trigger-happy Branden and his squad to drop a bomb on the building, which the Commissioner claims has already been scheduled for demolition. While dodging the fire from the explosion, Batman\\'s belt (which contained explosives) catches fire, and he is forced to discard it. After suffering two dizzying gun wounds, Batman escapes into the secure basement and survives the blast. A crowd gathers outside the building. Stuck with only a blow gun and 3 darts, Batman uses a small device in his boot to summon thousands of bats from his cave to the building. A battle occurs as the police storm into the building and hunt him down. He incapacitates some and even saves a cat, jumping out of the building (after throwing a police officer forcefully through a wall) and takes advantage of the chaos that occurs when the bat colony arrives to speed away on a police motorcycle and escape. Gordon has a brief affair with Essen. During the affair, he is confronted by the Commissioner, who threatens to inform his wife of the affair if he doesn\\'t comply. Gordon, after bringing his wife to an interview with Bruce Wayne, whom he and others suspect of being Batman, stops the car in the driveway on the way back and tells her about his affair. Essen later leaves for New York. Months pass and Batman overhears the local mafia boss, Carmine Falcone , planning revenge against Gordon. Selina Kyle, frustrated because she feels her petty crimes aren\\'t enough, interferes and attacks the group. Batman does not appear, but helps Selina from the shadows, throwing small bat-shaped blades laced with tranquilizers at some of the men. Bruce, while working out, figures out the plan based on the part of the conversation he was able to record. Gordon is called away by the police to investigate a robbery. On his way out, a mysterious motorist entering his garage raises Gordon\\'s suspicions, as Gordon has never seen the motorist. He returns to the garage only to find his wife and baby being pulled into a car. He shoots and kills the men trying to take his wife, who survives; however, one assailant is unharmed. The car leaves with Gordon\\'s baby in it, and Gordon shoots the motorist, takes his motorcycle and follows. The motorist, Bruce, is unharmed thanks to a bullet-proof vest. He attempts to leave, but not before Barbara threatens to shoot him. She lets him go when he promises to save her baby, takes a bicycle from a passing stranger, and pursues Gordon and the car. Gordon shoots out a wheel on the car and it crashes into the side of a bridge. The don\\'s hired knife, his nephew, exits the car, baby in hand. A struggle ensues and the baby is thrown off the bridge, followed by Gordon. However, Bruce had already arrived and dived after the baby before Gordon even falls over the rail. Gordon, having lost his glasses in the struggle with the hitman, thanks Bruce (whom he claims to not recognize due to his aforementioned missing glasses) and makes it clear that he won\\'t turn him in. Dent and Batman\\'s efforts bear fruit with Flass, who is persuaded to turn damaging states evidence against his superiors, including a disgraced Commissioner Loeb, who is forced to resign. Although his immediate replacement, Grogan, is apparently worse, Gordon is content for the moment with receiving a job promotion and family counseling with his wife. The story ends with the new Captain Gordon waiting on the rooftop of the GCPD headquarters for Batman, to discuss somebody called the Joker and his scheme to poison the reservoir. The story also includes the first appearance of Mafia don Carmine Falcone . Issues Batman #404 Batman #405 Batman #406 Batman #407 Continuity Following Crisis on Infinite Earths , DC rebooted many of its titles. Year One was followed by Batman: Year Two , but the 1994 Zero Hour crossover erased it from continuity. In another continuity re-arrangement, Catwoman: Year One ( Catwoman Annual #2, 1998) posited that Selina Kyle had not actually been a prostitute, but, rather, a thief posing as one in order to commit crimes. The story was continued in the 2005 graphic novel Batman: The Man Who Laughs , following up on Gordon informing Batman about the Joker, and thus recounting their first official encounter. In 1998 Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale created Batman: The Long Halloween and Batman: Dark Victory , two 13 issue limited series that recounted Batman\\'s first, second, and third years as a crime-fighter, also re-telling of the origins of Two-Face and Dick Grayson . Two other stories, Batman and the Monster Men and Batman and the Mad Monk tie into the same time period of Batman\\'s career. Launched in 1989 following the success of the film Batman , the title Legends of the Dark Knight examines crime-fighting exploits from the first three to four years of Batman\\'s career. This title rotated in creative teams and time placement, but several stories directly relate to the events of Year One , especially the first arc \"Batman: Shaman\". Following the title\\'s 2007 cancellation, Batman Confidential began publication, depicting Batman sometime between Year One and The Long Halloween . Year One exists in the same continuity as the other storylines in Miller\\'s \"Dark Knight Universe\", consisting of Batman: The Dark Knight Returns , its sequel Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again , Spawn/Batman and All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder . Needless to say, of these only Year One is considered to be part of mainstream DC continuity. However Earth-31, one of the alternate earths revealed in 52 , is essentially the Frank Miller Dark Knight Universe. Film adaptation Darren Aronofsky was going to direct a film adaptation written by himself and Frank Miller. The project never received the greenlight by Warner Bros. because they found it to be too violent and with many differences with the comic. Ultimately the project resulted into Christopher Nolan \\'s Batman Begins . The first draft of the script has been leaked online, though only written by Miller. The film was one of many projects developed at the studio over the years on trying to get a fifth Batman installment. Others listed included Batman Unchained , Batman: DarKnight , Boaz Yakin\\'s Batman Beyond , and Wolfgang Peterson\\'s Batman vs Superman . Development After the critical and financial failure of Batman & Robin , late director Joel Schumacher felt he owed \"the hardcore Batman fans the Batman movie they would love me to give them.\" It was in the summer of 1998, whereas Schumacher claimed he had pitched to Warner Bros. a film adaptation of Frank Miller \\'s acclaimed graphic novel Batman: Year One . Despite his interest, the studio decided to go to renowned independent filmmaker Darren Aronofsky, after they were impressed with his work on π . When asked how he might approach the Batman film series Aronofsky originally wanted to do an adaptation of The Dark Knight Returns , another one of Miller\\'s acclaimed works. He expressed interest in casting Clint Eastwood as the aging Batman and filming it in Tokyo, doubling for Gotham City . The studio was interested in the idea, though Aronofsky later changed his mind for an adaptation of Year One . Aronofsky would later go to work on Requiem for a Dream, while Warner Bros. were still reluctant for a film adaptation of Year One . This included the Batman Beyond and Batman: DarKnight projects that eventually fell apart. After completing Requiem for a Dream , Aronofsky came back to the studio for the adaptation, and officially signing on in September 2000. He brought Frank Miller with him to write the script, whom the two previously collaborated on for an adaptation of Ronin . Year One was to be inspired by 1970s crime dramas such as Taxi Driver , The French Connection , Serpico , and Death Wish . Aronofsky also wanted to bring \"an independent guerrilla flavor to it.\" Over the course on the project, Aronofsky claims that the film wasn\\'t greenlighted because Warner Bros. found it to be too violent, citing that an R-rated Batman film wouldn\\'t appeal to children. As such the director came up with an idea that they could make two separate films. One was to be Aronofsky/Miller\\'s Year One that wouldn\\'t require a massive budget, and the second to be one that could garner to a family friendly audience. The studio ultimately turned down the concept. Warner Bros. then enlisted the aid of the Wachowski brothers , who went as far as writing a brief proposal. They couldn\\'t work any longer due to their commitment on The Matrix sequels and Warner Brothers asked Aronofsky if he would be willing to write/direct the film based on their proposal. He turned down the offer and the studio then enlisted more pitches. In December 2002, Joss Whedon pitched an origin story that he liked very much, but claims that Warner Bros. executives were \"staring at him as if he were in a fishbowl.\" Ultimately in January 2003, Christopher Nolan was hired to take over and the result was Batman Begins . Plot Frank Miller wrote a draft, which is to this day, the only one leaked online. The story went as: After the death of his parents young Bruce Wayne remains lost on the street and is eventually taken in by Big Al, owner of an auto repair shop with his son Little Al. Driven by a desire for vengeance towards a manifest destiny of which his is only dimly aware, young Bruce toils day and night in the shop, watching the comings and goings of hookers, pimps, and corrupt police officers across the street to a cat house. We are then introduced to detective James Gordon as he struggles with the corruption he finds endemic among Gotham City police officers of all ranks. Bruce\\'s first act as a vigilante is to confront a dirty cop named Campbell as he accosts \"mistress Selina\" in the cathouse, but Campbell ends up dead and Bruce narrowly escapes being blamed. Realizing that he needs to operate with more methodology, he initially dons a cape and hockey mask. However, Bruce soon evolves a more stylized \"costume\" with both form and function, acquires a variety of makeshift gadgets and weapons, and re-configures a black Lincoln Continental into a makeshift \"bat-mobile.\" In his new disguise as \"The Bat-Man,\" Bruce Wayne wages war on criminals from street level to the highest echelons, working his way up to Police Commissioner Loeb and Mayor Noone, even as the executors of the Wayne estate search for their missing heir. In the end, Bruce accepts his dual destiny as heir to the Wayne fortune and the city\\'s savior, and Gordon comes to accept that, while he may not agree with \"the Bat-Man\"\\'s methods, he can\\'t argue with the results. No casting ever took place, though Val Kilmer , Ben Affleck, Keanu Reeves and Christian Bale all expressed interest for the role of Batman . Kilmer would only do it \"if it were to be more humorous,\" while Bale cited the role as \"a dream come true.\" His agent then told MovieHole.net that Bale had been approached for a number of Batman projects, including Year One . He stated that Bale preferred the Year One version because the script was more \"unique.\" Bale would of course end up being cast for the lead role in Christopher Nolan \\'s Batman Begins . References to other media When Bruce is heading for the Red Light District, he makes references to the \"Finger Memorial\", \"Sprang Mission\" and \"Robinson Park\", all of which are named after Golden Age Batman writer Bill Finger , artist Dick Sprang , and artist Jerry Robinson . The nocturnal scene depicting Gordon and Essen in a bar called \"Hopper\\'s\" is a graphic allusion to Edward Hopper\\'s painting Nighthawks . The moment when Bruce decides which method he will use to fight crime is widely regarded as a reference to Edgar Allan Poe\\'s poem The Raven , by the kind of chamber he is in and the bust over which the bat lands. References in other works Batman: Mask of the Phantasm shows a rather similar early vigilante effort by Bruce Wayne before he decided to dress in a bat-uniform. Later in the story Batman is trapped a derelict building and evades a SWAT team while injured. It differs in that he once tried to be \"normal\" in pursuit of a romantic relationship, it is only when the girl cut off their relationship that he reverts to his original plan for single-minded a war on crime. The events of Batman Begins featured numerous influences from Year One , including the characters of Commissioner Loeb (though much less corrupt) and Arnold Flass (visualy modified to more closely resemble Harvey Bullock ). The bat swarm sequence appears in a slightly different context. The Memory Cloth Cape comes from a Wayne family company, in Year One its mentioned that light weight plastics from the company where used to create the Bat-Glider . The 2008 sequel has a similar final showdown where Batman falls while saving Gordon\\'s child, forming a special bond between the pair. Both movies show Batman evading and fighting SWAT. Elements of this story were also included in Batman: Arkham Origins , including the Gotham City Police Department being notoriously corrupt under the control of Commissioner Loeb, Gordon\\'s initial antagonism of Batman for the latter\\'s vigilante methods, and an event in the extortion tapes where Loeb and Black Mask alluded to a failed attempt to have Arnold Flass \"beat some sense\" into Gordon. In addition, another extortion tape, also with Loeb, featured Loeb telling Harvey Bullock to keep tabs on Gordon as well as possibly arrange a honeypot trap on him, indirectly referring to Gordon\\'s affair with Sarah Essen. Although operating as an origin series, Gotham took inspiration from Year One , most notably during the first season. Elements include Jim Gordon starting out at the GCPD, and the series depicting Carmine Falcone \\'s control over the Gotham City Police Department. Other characters from the comic included Arnold Flass , who appeared half-way through season 1 as an enemy of Jim Gordon, and Sarah Essen , although she was re-imagined as the captain of the precinct, with no romance involved with Gordon. The Batman starring Robert Pattinson takes place in his second year of vigilantism, but still draws heavily from Year One . Zoë Kravitz \\'s skin tone and hairstyle resembles Mazzucchelli\\'s drawings of Selina Kyle. Parodies The image of Bruce sitting and bleeding while waiting for inspiration is reused in the Elseworlds tale Batman: In Darkest Knight , though instead of a bat flying through the window, a dying Green Lantern summons him and bestows him with the ring. The fact that Miller based Bruce on a young Gregory Peck is coincidental to a much-discussed hoax. In 2004, Mark Millar wrote about a failed attempt by Orson Welles to adapt a feature film of Batman in 1946. Although this has since been proven fictional, it is true that Welles attempted to star as The Shadow in a film adaptation, which never got off the ground.', 'Doug Moench General Information Birth Date: February 23, 1948 Birth Place: Chicago, Illinois USA Doug Moench is an American writer.

      "    response='Batman originally started as a comic book character, not a movie. He first appeared in Detective Comics #27, published in May 1939, created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. This comic book debut laid the foundation for his cultural impact as a superhero. While Batman has since been adapted into numerous films, starting with the 1943 serial \"The Batman,\" his true origins are in the world of comics. If you\\'re curious about more details, like the first comic storyline or how his character evolved into films, I can share that—such as the 1989 Tim Burton film that revitalized his popularity. What else would you like to know about Batman\\'s history?'\n",
      "), Prediction(\n",
      "    reasoning='The user\\'s question about Batman\\'s age stems from curiosity about DC Comics lore, as inferred from the student goal. The context provides specific details from various Batman adaptations, particularly noting in passage [2] that Bruce Wayne is 26 years old in season 1 of \"The Batman\" series and became Batman at 23. However, Batman\\'s age varies across different media, comics, and timelines, which could lead to confusion. To address the pragmatic need for a clear, reliable answer, I must draw from the most directly relevant context while acknowledging this variability to avoid misinformation. My reasoning involves: 1) Prioritizing the explicit age mentioned in the context for accuracy; 2) Explaining the broader context of adaptations to enhance understanding and prevent follow-up confusion; 3) Crafting a cooperative response that is engaging, anticipates questions about other versions (e.g., comic books, films, or animated series), and invites further discussion to align with the user\\'s exploratory interest in superhero lore.',\n",
      "    cooperative_answer='Batman, whose real identity is Bruce Wayne, doesn\\'t have a fixed age since he\\'s a character from various DC Comics adaptations, but based on the context from \"The Batman\" series, Bruce is depicted as 26 years old in season 1, and he began his crime-fighting career as Batman at age 23. This comes from the animated series where his backstory involves becoming a vigilante after his parents\\' death. Keep in mind that Batman\\'s age can change depending on the story or medium—for example, in other comics or films like Batman \\'89 or Batman: The Animated Series, he\\'s often portrayed as being in his 20s to 30s to fit the narrative, reflecting his peak physical condition and detective skills.\\n\\nIf you\\'re diving into superhero lore, it\\'s fun to note that this flexibility allows for different interpretations, like an older Bruce in later stories symbolizing experience and wisdom.

Batman is the secret identity of billionaire Bruce Wayne , the CEO of Wayne Enterprises, who, after witnessing the death of his parents, vowed to spend the rest of his life warring on all criminals. He is a founding member of the Justice League . Contents 1 History 2 Appearance 3 Powers and Abilities 4 Paraphernalia 4.1 Equipment 4.2 Transportation 4.3 Weapons 4.4 Batsuits 5 Appearances 6 Trivia 7 Voiced by History Bruce Wayne was born a child of wealth and privilege to Thomas and Martha Wayne of Gotham City. As the Waynes\\' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father\\'s business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler, Alfred Pennyworth , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents\\' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City. As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named Ethan Bennett . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\". As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents\\' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot. For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman\\'s activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police Angel Rojas took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named Ellen Yin , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham. In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date – the Joker . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes. The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham\\'s underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named Bane . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of the Penguin , Man-Bat , Killer Croc , Cluemaster and Catwoman . One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce\\'s career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface. Some time later, a new character entered the Batman\\'s life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally. Barbara Gordon , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordan , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend Poison Ivy from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara\\'s aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt. The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist Dick Grayson was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named Tony Zucco . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick\\'s acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force. Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself John Jones . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called the Joining . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth\\'s atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John\\'s behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as Lex Luthor . At some point later, in the year 2027, Mr. Freeze had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named Nightwing . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever. One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave\\'s titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman\\'s legacy survived into the future.

His personal favourite was the Gray Ghost , watching the television show with his father. On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to Wonder Woman , Bruce hadn\\'t been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes\\' faithful friend and butler, Alfred Pennyworth Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from Yoru Sensei . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor\\'s daughter Zatanna became very close. As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with Andrea Beaumont . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\". War on Crime Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the Batcave . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city\\'s underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in Dick Grayson as his ward after witnessing his parents\\' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down their murderer . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and Commissioner James Gordon , working with them to control crime in Gotham. Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included the Penguin , Poison Ivy , Mr. Freeze and the Scarecrow . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including Catwoman and Two-Face . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered the Joker , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created. New Adventures Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as Batwoman . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called Batgirl began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father\\'s legacy as the next Police Commissioner. Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned Tim Drake from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder. Joining Up For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called Blüdhaven . Batman would later find himself in Metropolis , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with Lex Luthor , Batman would find himself working with Superman to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker\\'s plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue\\'s gallery. He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another\\'s home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity. Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper. It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world\\'s greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League. Saving the World Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech\\'s deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station\\'s antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J\\'onn J\\'onzz\\' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna\\'s destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch. Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman\\'s mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don\\'t even think about it\". When the Imperium\\'s attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation. Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J\\'onn J\\'onzz. After freeing J\\'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J\\'onn J\\'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of Wonder Woman . The Flash arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing\\'s severed wing. After J\\'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium\\'s invasion of Mars , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium\\'s factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun\\'s rays. The heroes split up to disable the factories. Batman went to Giza, Egypt with Wonder Woman and J\\'onn J\\'onzz. The trio infiltrated the factory and found the Ion Matrix Crystal, a vital component of the plant. Batman and Wonder Woman provided a diversion to allow J\\'onzz to remove the crystal. As he removed the crystal, J\\'onzz was incapacitated by Imperium forces. Batman then covered Wonder Woman and J\\'onzz\\' escape from the plant, but was himself trapped inside and cornered by Imperium forces. J\\'onzz reported that Batman was dead, but in truth, he had mentally shielded Batman to prevent the Imperium forces from detecting him. Batman remained hidden until the Imperium arrived on Earth. He then revealed himself and reversed the ion charge in the Ion Matrix Crystal, causing the plant to burn off the smoke it had been producing. With the sun shining again, the heroes defeated the Imperium and freed their human prisoners, then mopped up the remaining Imperium forces around the globe. Inspired by a general\\'s speech about vigilance and the possible return of the invaders, Batman had the Watchtower constructed by Wayne Enterprises, hiding the funding as a \"line item in the aerospace R&D budget\". Batman invited the other six heroes who had repelled the invaders to the station. The seven heroes formed the Justice League. Claiming he wasn\\'t a \"people person\", Batman did not officially join the League, though he did offer to be on call when the League needed his help. Long considered the brains of the League, Batman often found solutions that eluded the other members. He was quick to place himself in danger, despite the awe-inspiring powers of his teammates. During the Atlantis Usurpation, Batman put a stop to the melting of the Polar Ice Caps. On another occasion, Batman single-handedly defeated five dangerous criminals before being taken prisoner by an Amazon trained criminal. During his time with the League, Batman showed his distrust of Superman. After Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid and when Batman had to pull Superman back later when he attempted to end Darkseid\\'s life, Batman began carrying a piece of Kryptonite, which was revealed when the android Amazo copied Superman\\'s powers. However, Batman still held a deep respect for the Man of Steel, especially after he had seemingly died at the hands of Toyman. But, regardless of his respect, Batman remained stubborn in his disbelief in Superman\\'s death, and refused to mourn for him for quite a while. During the Thanagarian Invasion of Earth, Batman was forced to reveal his identity to his teammates. After successfully retaking the Watchtower from Thanagarian Forces, Batman piloted the Watchtower through the Earth\\'s atmosphere in an attempt to plunge it into a Hyperspace Bypass, a city-wide machine that would generate a wormhole through the Earth. As Batman lost consciousness due to the heat surrounding him, Superman rescued him and as the Watchtower destroyed the Bypass Generator. With the Watchtower\\'s destruction and Hawkgirl \\'s resignation from the League, Batman and the five other members reformed the Justice League with a new Watchtower and an expanded roster of heroes. Batman was instrumental in recruiting Green Arrow into the League, who along with other human league members, helped keep the League from becoming an autonomous Metahuman army. With Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, Batman fought Chronos across time, an adventure during which he met another Batman as well as his older self. He also succeeded in demonstrating to Amanda Waller that Cadmus was being used as a tool to further Lex Luthor\\'s personal agenda to discredit and destroy the Justice League. Amanda Waller was so impressed with Batman that she created Project Batman Beyond to ensure that the world would always have a Batman. Joker\\'s Final Joke After these events, Robin went missing for three weeks while on patrol, with Batman and Batgirl searching for him, until they learned he was at Arkham Asylum . They encounter Joker and Harley Quinn , who reveal that they adopted a son named J.J.(Joker, Jr.), who was actually Robin brainwashed and driven insane. Joker seems to escape, with Batman hot in pursuit. However, he was actually trying to lure Batman into Arkham\\'s Cineplex, where he reveals that he subjected Robin to countless amounts of psychological and physical tortures, and because of this, Joker now knows Batman\\'s true identity, and everything about him. Batman, enraged at the cruelty and torture Joker inflicted onto Robin, smashes through the theater box, and beats Joker down (wrecking the projector in the process, causing Joker to say \"If you don\\'t like the movie, I\\'ve got slides!\"), then hurls Joker down to the room that J.J.\\'s in. Batman threatens to break Joker in half, causing the Joker to retort that he would have done it years ago if he really wanted to do it. Suddenly, The Joker draws a switchblade, and slices Batman\\'s chest, as well as stabs his leg. He then gives what looks like a gun to J.J. and tells him to kill Batman (or, in his words, \"deliver the punchline.\"). J.J. then pulls the trigger, revealing the gun to actually be the infamous \"Bang!\" flag spear gun that is one of the Joker\\'s trademark weapons. J.J. apparently hesitates to kill Batman, causing the Joker to shout \"DO IT!\". Tim reluctantly obliges. Instead of killing Batman however, he instead turns it away at the last second, thus shooting the Joker instead, killing him. J.J. half laughs and half sobs at the events, and Batgirl (having arrived after her fight with Harley Quinn) tries to console him. Commissioner Gordon and Batman later bury the body of Joker in the ruins of Arkham, and Tim is taken to Doctor Leslie Thompkins for rehabilitation. After these events, Batman forbade Tim Drake from ever becoming Robin again. Tim attempted to go solo for a few years, but in the end quit the super-hero life, got married and had children. He broke off contact with Bruce but remained close with Barbara and perhaps Dick. Also, as a result of the fight, Batman walked with a slight limp which in his later years would force him to walk with a cane. Late Adventures Many years passed following the attack of the Joker on the Bat-Family, Bruce entered middle age and began to suffer with a bad heart from the effects of a hard life of crime fighting. Batman developed a powered high tech suit (which had longer Bat ears and minus a cape) that augmented his physical abilities and allowed him to continue the never-ending battle for a few more years. At this time, his corporate rivalry with Derek Powers began, and Wayne Enterprises resisted a hostile bid for corporate takeover. However, injuries suffered through the long decades of physical punishment and an ailing heart finally took their toll, and even the suit couldn\\'t compensate any longer. While attempting to rescue his old friend Veronica Vreeland\\'s daughter Bunny Vreeland from kidnappers, Batman managed to subdue the kidnappers with limited effort until he was forced to point a gun at a common thug to save Ms. Vreeland and his own life after suffering a heart attack while in the midst of the fight. Injured, Batman limps outside the hangar, removing his mask upon realizing he was wielding a handgun, forced to rely on the weapon of his parents\\' cowardly murderer to defend himself against criminals. Ashamed, Bruce returns to the Batcave, where he places the Batsuit in the costume display gallery. Walking to the top of the stairs, Bruce takes one last look at the Batcave and solemnly vows, \"Never again.\" Vowing to never again wear the cowl, Bruce then shuts off the lights, and leaves his past in the darkness. Passing the Mantle of the Bat When he hung up the mantle of the bat, Bruce came a recluse, shut off in Wayne Manor with his dog, Ace. He withdrew from the day to day operations of Wayne Enterprises, a decision that left the company vulnerable to a takeover by Derek Powers and caused Wayne much regret. It was now the year 2039 and Bruce Wayne had become a very old man. Chance brought teen-aged Terry McGinnis to the gates of Wayne Manor, where he learned of Bruce\\'s past secret life. After McGinnis suffered the loss of his father, Bruce reluctantly agreed to allow him to take up mantle of Batman. Bruce then served as a mentor and informant for the successor to his legacy. For years, Bruce coordinated with Terry, supplying advice and direction from the Batcave while McGinnis worked in the field. He also ran the labs and developed new gadgets for Terry to use in the new crusade against crime. The elderly Bruce Wayne occasionally ventured into the field to support Terry. His sense of duty and self-sacrifice ever present, he once donned a suit of Batman armor to rescue Terry from the villain Inque, despite Inque\\'s Metahuman power and the strain produced on Bruce\\'s already damaged heart. As Bruce continued to age, he suffered a kidney failure. When it was discovered that Terry was not just a suitable donor but a perfect one, their relationship reached its weakest point; Terry, like Dick Grayson before him, felt betrayed, manipulated, and outright used. He set off to uncover the truth from someone willing to reveal it. Terry confronted Amanda Waller and learned the truth about his heritage. In her earlier years, Waller realized the world would always need a Batman. Taking fate into her own hands (unbeknownst to Bruce), she gathered a sample of Bruce Wayne\\'s genetic material, after a battle that left Batman in need of medical attention. Using her Cadmus connections, Waller implanted this genetic material into a young Warren McGinnis, replacing his genetic material with Bruce\\'s. Thus, Terry McGinnis was born, the son of Bruce Wayne, sharing half his genetic code. Terry returned to Wayne Manor with a new sense of purpose. Bruce wondered about the fate of Gotham, and Terry replied \"I\\'ve got it covered. Always.\" Their relationship repaired; Bruce had truly become the father Terry had lost long ago. The Savage Timeline In an alternate timeline created by Vandal Savage, the Axis forces won World War II. There, Bruce Wayne lost his parents when they spoke out against the regime and became Batman to fight Savage and his forces. He served as the leader of the resistance movement, recruiting other victims. Unlike his original self, Batman was willing to use guns without a second thought. When the Justice League from the original timeline arrived, Batman helped them escape from the authorities and learned of our timeline. He assisted them in breaking into the facility where the time portal was kept. However, Batman did not accompany the League into the past to thwart Savage, preferring to stay behind and lead the resistance in case they failed. It is assumed that this reality ceased to exist when the League defeated Savage and counteract the Axis powers\\' artificial advantages. Powers and Abilities Through his years of intensive physical training, the Batman represents the peak of human physical conditioning. Batman is at peak human levels of strength, stamina, agility, coordination, reflexes, speed, and durability. Even well into old age, Bruce Wayne still demonstrated that he could manhandle other much younger men with ease. Batman\\'s martial arts discipline was never mentioned, in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Bruce Wayne mentions Ju Jitsu. Batman was also a master of stealth and infiltration (all the more remarkable given that he stands 6\\'2\" and weighs 215 lbs), and often revealed himself to his enemies when they least suspected him to. This also allowed him to just disappear from allies in mid-sentence, a habit that frequently annoyed the likes of Commissioner Gordon (\"one of these days I\\'m gonna nail his feet to the ground\") and Harvey Bullock (\"I wonder how the Commish puts up with that\"). Batman was capable of incredible feats of agility. During the Second Apokolyptian invasion, Darkseid commented with much surprise that Batman had been the first one to dodge his Omega Beams. With his martial arts prowess, occasionally augmented by technology, Batman was usually more than a match for any foe he encountered, human or otherwise. Equipment As the head of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce Wayne has access to cutting edge technology and Batman makes good use of it in his field equipment. Batsuit-standard as well as heat-resistant, cold-resistant, and underwater versions. Batarangs-of differing size and effect. These ranged from standard, to explosive, electric, remote, etc. Grapple-gun. This item assisted Batman in scaling the various buildings of Gotham City. Utility Belt - Batman\\'s Utility Belt has compartments to hold several items, the contents of which change according to his needs, and often include items such as flashlights, laser cutters, underwater rebreathers, binoculars, a fingerprinting kit, flashbangs, remote controls for his vehicles, acid/base compounds, anti-toxins, mini-computer, and smoke pellets. Vehicles Batman has used several vehicles in the course of his crimefighting career, including: Batmobile Batwing Batcycle Batboat Appearances Batman: The Animated Series Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero The New Batman Adventures Superman: The Animated Series Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman Batman Beyond Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Justice League Justice League Unlimited Static Shock'],\n",
      "    response='Batman, whose real identity is Bruce Wayne, doesn\\'t have a fixed age since he\\'s a character from various DC Comics adaptations, but based on the context from \"The Batman\" series, Bruce is depicted as 26 years old in season 1, and he began his crime-fighting career as Batman at age 23. This comes from the animated series where his backstory involves becoming a vigilante after his parents\\' death. Keep in mind that Batman\\'s age can change depending on the story or medium—for example, in other comics or films like Batman \\'89 or Batman: The Animated Series, he\\'s often portrayed as being in his 20s to 30s to fit the narrative, reflecting his peak physical condition and detective skills.\\n\\nIf you\\'re diving into superhero lore, it\\'s fun to note that this flexibility allows for different interpretations, like an older Bruce in later stories symbolizing experience and wisdom. If you\\'d like more details on specific versions, such as how his age affects his abilities in the comics or comparisons across movies, just let me know—I\\'m here to help expand on that!'\n",
