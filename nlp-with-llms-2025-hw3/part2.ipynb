    "Why we chose to enrich the model with the intermediary fields “student_goal” and “pragmatic_need”:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Capture the core idea: Cooperative answers rely on Theory of Mind (ToM) elements—understanding the user’s goals, intent, and needs. These fields allow the model to explicitly represent and reason about them.\n",

    "2) Cost efficiency: If we instead generated “cooperative” questions and re-queried the context, the number of LLM calls and input tokens would increase significantly, raising costs. By focusing directly on the core idea, we can anticipate such questions more efficiently."

He\\'s portrayed as a supernatural dream demon who preys on people\\'s nightmares, often appearing as a disfigured man with a red and green striped sweater, a battered fedora hat, and a glove equipped with razor-sharp blades. In the story, Freddy was originally a groundskeeper at a preschool who met a tragic end and returned as an immortal entity seeking revenge. This character has become a cultural icon in horror, symbolizing the terror of the subconscious mind and appearing in multiple films, TV shows, and even video games like those in the Mortal Kombat series.\\n\\nTo give you a bit more context, Freddy\\'s story explores themes of fear and justice, and he\\'s been played by actors such as Robert Englund in the original films and Jackie Earle Haley in the 2010 reboot. If you\\'re curious about specific aspects—like the plot of the first movie, his powers, or how he fits into pop culture—I can provide more details or recommendations for safe viewing. Just ask!'\n",

The story centers on two corrupt detectives who accidentally kill an undercover DEA agent and then attempt to frame a homeless man for the crime, leading to a tense web of deception and moral consequences.\\n\\nTo give you a fuller picture, the film explores themes of corruption, guilt, and the fallout from bad decisions, making it a gripping watch for fans of crime dramas. If you\\'re deciding whether to view it, keep in mind it\\'s known for its strong performances, especially Tupac\\'s, and has a runtime of about 1 hour and 51 minutes.

None of the films mentioned appear to be recent releases, so I\\'ll summarize the relevant directors and their notable films from the context to guide you. For instance:\\n\\n- Stuart Gordon directed films like *Re-Animator* (1985), *From Beyond* (1986), and *Dagon* (2001), often drawing from H.P. Lovecraft\\'s themes.\\n- Billy Bob Thornton directed *Sling Blade* (1996) and has acted in films like *Armageddon* (1998) and voiced a role in *Princess Mononoke* (1997, though he didn\\'t direct it).\\n- Coleman Francis directed low-budget films such as *The Beast of Yucca Flats* (1961) and *The Skydivers* (1963).\\n- Ted V. Mikels helmed exploitation films like *Catalina Caper* (1967, as cinematographer) and *Girl in Gold Boots* (1968).\\n- Walter Scott Murch directed *Return to Oz* (1985) and is renowned for his work in sound and film editing on projects like *Apocalypse Now* (1979).\\n\\nIf \"the new film\" refers to one of these or something more recent, could you provide more details, such as the title, genre, or year? This would help me give a more precise answer and connect it to your interests in film history.

      "    cooperative_answer='Yes, the Batman comics and movies share many similarities, but there are also notable differences that can affect how the story is experienced. Let me break this down for you based on the core elements like themes, characters, storylines, and overall portrayal.\\n\\n**Similarities:**\\n- **Themes and Portrayal:** Both comics and movies often explore themes of justice, vigilantism, psychological depth, and moral ambiguity. For instance, the comic \"The Dark Knight Returns\" by Frank Miller, which depicts a older, grittier Batman fighting crime in a dystopian Gotham, heavily influenced films like Christopher Nolan\\'s Dark Knight Trilogy. In these adaptations, Batman\\'s internal struggles and his war on crime mirror the comic\\'s portrayal of him as a symbol of fear and retribution.\\n- **Characters:** Iconic characters like Batman (Bruce Wayne), the Joker, and villains such as Two-Face or Bane appear in both mediums with similar core traits. For example, the Joker\\'s chaotic and manipulative nature is consistent across comics like \"The Dark Knight\" and movies like \"The Dark Knight\" (2008), where Heath Ledger\\'s performance drew from comic inspirations.\\n- **Storylines:** Many movies adapt specific comic arcs. Nolan\\'s films, for instance, incorporate elements from \"Batman: Year One\" and \"The Dark Knight Returns,\" such as Batman\\'s origin, his battles with organized crime, and high-stakes conflicts. Even recent films like \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" (2016) pull from comic crossovers, showing Batman in a more brutal, world-weary light.\\n\\n**Differences:**\\n- **Depth and Detail:** Comics often provide more intricate backstories, multiple timelines, and character development through detailed panels and ongoing series, which movies might simplify for runtime. For example, the comics allow for deeper exploration of Batman\\'s psyche, while movies like the Tim Burton ones (1989-1992) emphasize visual spectacle and a more theatrical tone.\\n- **Tone and Adaptation:** Early movies, like the 1960s TV-inspired \"Batman: The Movie,\" are campy and light-hearted, contrasting with the darker, realistic tone of modern comics and films like Nolan\\'s trilogy. This means comics can vary widely in style, but movies often adapt to appeal to a broader audience, sometimes altering storylines for dramatic effect.\\n- **Pacing and Medium-Specific Elements:** Comics use sequential art for complex narratives, while movies rely on action sequences and CGI, which can make them more accessible but less exploratory.\\n\\nIf you\\'re deciding which to start with, I recommend beginning with a foundational comic like \"The Dark Knight Returns\" for its influential story, then watching a related movie like \"The Dark Knight\" to see the translation. This way, you can appreciate how adaptations build on the source material. Do you have a specific comic or movie in mind for more details, or are you curious about recommendations based on your interests?'\n",
