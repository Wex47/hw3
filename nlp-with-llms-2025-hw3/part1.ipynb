    "# Analysis of Task 4.3 Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Summary:\n",
    "From your attached results:\n",
    "Literal Configuration: 0.433 SemanticF1 (best performance, 91.1% coverage)\n",
    "Pragmatic Configuration: 0.371 SemanticF1 (moderate performance, 96.1% coverage)\n",
    "Retrieved Configuration: 0.079 SemanticF1 (poor performance, 100% coverage)\n",
    "### Key Findings:\n",
    "1. Where the Model Succeeds:\n",
    "Literal Context Processing: The model performs best (0.433 SemanticF1) when given literal spans from the dataset. This suggests that:\n",
    "DistilBERT excels at extractive QA when the answer is explicitly stated in the context\n",
    "The model can effectively identify and extract factual information that directly answers the question\n",
    "Traditional NLP approaches work well for straightforward, literal information needs\n",
    "High Coverage: The model successfully processes most questions across configurations (91-100% coverage), indicating robustness in handling diverse topics and question types.\n",
    "2. Where the Model Fails:\n",
    "Retrieved Context (Major Weakness): The dramatically poor performance (0.079) with retrieved context reveals several critical limitations:\n",
    "Context Quality Issues: The retrieval system may be returning irrelevant or noisy passages\n",
    "Context Length/Complexity: Retrieved contexts may be too long, unfocused, or contain contradictory information\n",
    "Topic Drift: Cross-topic contamination where Batman experts might return Captain Jack Sparrow information (as seen in your evaluation logs)\n",
    "Extractive Limitation: DistilBERT is designed for extractive QA but struggles when the exact answer isn't present in the noisy retrieved context\n",
    "### Pragmatic Reasoning Gap: The pragmatic configuration (0.371) performs worse than literal (0.433), indicating:\n",
    "The model struggles to synthesize information that requires inference beyond literal spans\n",
    "Traditional QA models lack the reasoning capabilities needed for cooperative/pragmatic responses\n",
    "The model cannot effectively \"read between the lines\" or infer unstated but relevant information\n",
    "3. Does it Give Literal Answers When Pragmatic Ones Are Needed?\n",
    "Yes, absolutely. This is evident from several key indicators:\n",
    "Performance Pattern: The literal configuration significantly outperforms pragmatic (0.433 vs 0.371), suggesting the model is inherently biased toward extractive, literal responses rather than inferential, cooperative ones.\n",
    "Architectural Limitation: DistilBERT is designed for span-based extraction, not generative reasoning. It will naturally:\n",
    "Look for exact text matches in context\n",
    "Extract specific phrases rather than synthesize broader, more helpful responses\n",
    "Miss opportunities to provide additional relevant context that a human would intuitively include\n",
    "Cooperative QA Gap: The model fails to exhibit the \"over-answering\" behavior that defines cooperative QA. A pragmatic response should anticipate follow-up questions and provide enriched context, but traditional QA models don't have this capability.\n"
