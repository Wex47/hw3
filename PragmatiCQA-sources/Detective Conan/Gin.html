However, when FBI Agent Andre Camel mistakenly revealed himself in front of an old man who was actually Rum scouting the area in disguise, the Black Organization discovered Akai's true allegiance and Gin never appeared.

   Gin is a merciless and efficient assassin. He has no compunctions about killing or threatening his fellow teammates. Fitting his icy personality, Gin's displayed range of emotions so far is relatively limited. Wearing a threatening smirk, he enjoys hunting traitors, cornering his targets and watching the plans he has concocted succeed. Although he seems to take satisfaction with taking out someone personally, Gin is also satisfied with orchestrating a target's death even if he does not pull the trigger himself. Moreover, he is not easily frustrated and takes setbacks in a good stride. Gin is also patient and cautious, preferring to wait until success is most likely. He does not like potential loose ends, preferring to get rid of anyone or anything doubtful. On top of that, Gin does not trust anyone and does not fully believe anything he does not witness himself.
  </p>
  <p key="1cf4d505-151e-44f7-a746-0e32ddfed624">
   Gin is a decisive and quick acting leader in his own regard. He keeps the Boss informed on current happenings and often consults about actions that may have potentially serious ramifications. Although obedient to the Boss, he acts on his own initiative on more than one occasion. Gin is more than willing to take matters into his own hands when he feels another member has endangered the syndicate.
  </p>
  <p key="2e34cef6-4361-413c-a45d-a21caa4160b6">
   Gin's effective leadership is shown in how he manages the diverse personalities of his team on missions. If Gin feels any frustration or scorn regarding the behavior or abilities of any of his teammates, he does not show it unless it is actively interfering with his plans or threatening the Black Organization. However, that does not stop him from being contemptuous about others behind their backs. The Black Organization's respect for Gin keeps them in line and coerces them into obeying orders. Gin also respects the desires of his teammates to a certain degree, even though he may distrust them.

  <p key="031e8680-548e-4242-8ba8-4d78037278c1">
   Despite the aforementioned quality traits, Gin has two notorious weaknesses. He has difficulty remembering the faces and names of those he has killed.

Although both assassination plots were foiled by the combined efforts of Conan and the FBI, Gin discoverers the transmitter that Conan planted on Kir's shoe and assumes that the transmitter was set up by Kogoro. He contacts the Boss to inform about his discovery and requests his permission to kill him.

   who were taking aim. Over the protests of Vermouth, Gin orders the two snipers to kill Conan as well for, as Vodka says, being suspicious. This too is interrupted when Shuichi Akai snipes the transmitter out from between Gin's fingers from 700 yards away. A brief exchange of gunfire ensues, but ends quickly after Akai shoots out Gin's scope and puts two bullets in his flak jacket. Gin realizes the disadvantage of the situation and orders the Black Organization to disperse without taking any more action against Conan or Kogoro. As the Black Organization flees the area, Gin assumes that Kir was captured by the FBI and that the bug was also planted by the latter. Despite the lack of evidence about Kogoro's connection to the FBI, Gin still expresses his residual suspicions about the Sleeping Detective.

   When the Black Organization orchestrated a series of events to manipulate the FBI into revealing Kir's location, the FBI initiated a plan to transport Kir into another location. The three FBI Vans drive off with Chianti, Korn, and Vodka stalking them. Using thermal vision devices, they are able to see through the vans and upload the images to Gin who attempts to deduce which truck contains Kir. Vermouth follows Akai who is secretly tailing the second van, the vehicle being stalked by Chianti. However, Gin believed that the FBI would not do something obvious and Akai is luring them into a trap, causing them to believe that the first van Korn is stalking contains Kir. However, Gin stops them and reveals that Kir is in the van that Camel is driving, the one being stalked by Vodka.
