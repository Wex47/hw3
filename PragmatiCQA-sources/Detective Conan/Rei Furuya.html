   As a child, Rei Furuya often got into fights with other kids for being insulted for being as a “Half-Japanese”.
   Elena Miyano
   , a scientist who had more than once treated his injuries at her clinic, would often scold Rei for getting involved in such quarrels.

   and offered them to work at their Laboratory in exchange for huge sums of money. At first, Elena was reluctant to accept the proposal since the syndicate was rumored to have a bad reputation; but her husband,
   Atsushi Miyano
   , was able to convince her as the offer was a once in a life time opportunity to achieve their dreams. The Miyanos then decided to close their clinic for good and for the last time, Elena told Rei to avoid getting involved in an all-out brawl since she will no longer be by his side anymore to treat his wounds.
  </p>
  <p key="2437015c-1dd8-4919-bb68-c8c6b0458c16">
   Years after the Miyano's disappearance, Rei decided to enroll in a Police Academy in an attempt to work for the National Police Agency. With his prodigious information gathering abilities, exceptional intelligence and remarkable logical thinking, he became the smartest student at the Police Academy as claimed by his friend,
   Wataru Date

   At some point, the NPA learned the existence of the Black Organization, along with the illegal activities it has been operating. Rei Furuya then decided to infiltrate the mysterious syndicate to acquire more information about their members and the illicit activites they have been utilizing.

   To ensure the safety of his friends and relatives from any potential dangers associated with infiltrating the Black Organization, he has cut off ties and isolated himself from anyone involved in his life as "Rei Furuya". In addition, he started using the alias "Tooru Amuro" and worked as a Freelance Detective to mislead the Black Organization about his background and true identity.

   Four years ago, Rei along with Scotch and

   Federal Bureau of Investigation
   . With the current situation, Scotch was forced to commit suicide, but Rye tightly held the gun's cylinder which prevented Scotch from being able to pull the trigger. Rye then reveals his true identity and motive to sabotage the Black Organization, managing to prevent Scotch's death. However, in that moment, Rei's hurried footsteps were heard and both Scotch and Rye mistook them as approaching Black Organization Members. Rye was then distracted, allowing Scotch to pull the trigger and eventually died. As Rei arrived at the scene, he examined Scotch's body and concluded that Rye forced him to commit to suicide. Rye went along with Rei's deductions and claimed that he was the one who killed Scotch, unaware that Rei is also an undercover agent working for the NPA.

  <p key="24607a2c-1bc4-4560-aafa-0a0301c3b7e9">
   Since the incident, Rei developed an antipathy and strong hatred for Rye which sparked their rivalry in the Black Organization. Until now, Rei blames Rye for the death of Scotch and continues to hunt him down with
   Vermouth
   's indirect support in hopes of getting close to the heart of the organization upon turning him to the Boss of the Black Organization.

   Currently, Rei works as a Part-Time Waiter at

In such situations, Rei alternates himself between going out of his way to care about the well being of others and ignoring them when it is inconvenient.

   After Kir's "assassination" of Akai at Raiha Pass, Bourbon didn't initially believe Shuichi Akai was dead, so he came up with a plan to disguise as Akai to uncover the truth. He would approach Akai's close friends and colleagues and observe their reactions to him in order to see if the FBI Agent was really killed. To maximize his resources, Bourbon asked Vermouth for her disguise assistance, in exchange of protecting Conan Edogawa and

   The Boss approved their plan out of an abundance of caution. However, Vermouth and Bourbon failed to inform Gin and the other members about it, causing a misunderstanding. In order to maximize the chances of success, Bourbon targeted Akai's friends when they were alone and in crowded public places so they could not retaliate and Bourbon could disappear easily. Bourbon first used the disguise to approach
   Jodie Starling
   at Teito Bank, then
   Andre Camel
   at Beika Department Store, and finally Masumi Sera in front of Mouri Detective Agency. These encounters convinced Bourbon that Akai was really "dead".

   At some point later, after being involved with a case with Conan and Kogoro, Rei Furuya as "Tooru Amuro" has started work as a waiter at Café Poirot below the Mouri Detective Agency. He asks Kogoro if he can be the Great Detective's Apprentice and whispers some unheard amount of money that he would be paying if Kogoro brings Amuro along with him. The amount thrills Kogoro into accepting Amuro's offer immediately. Conan mentally moans about how yet another bothersome person has appeared. In truth, Bourbon suspected Kogoro of being connected to Sherry and has decided to investigate the individual.

   Meanwhile, Conan and the Detective Boys encounter Amuro who was coming from the police station due to the events of the previous case.

Later that night, Amuro furtively sneaks into the empty Mouri Detective Agency and logs onto Kogoro's website using the password Kogoro inadvertently told him in an earlier case where Conan has been kidnapped.

When Masumi Sera runs off to find Scar Akai (Vermouth), Amuro is seen with his phone out contacting Vermouth that she was heading her way. He then comes when Conan (through Kogoro) starts his deduction on the murder culprit and reveals that three mirror plates were stuffed in a painting which was used for the locked room murder trick.

  <p key="a3f6fd03-6270-4786-8e26-96f39bea30bd">
   However, after the culprit confesses, Vermouth activated smoke canisters throughout the train in order to lure Ai Haibara (who supposedly transformed back to Shiho Miyano) out. After that is successful, Amuro introduces himself to her by calling himself Bourbon. He goes on to ask Shiho if she knows who he is to which she claims that he was a rival to her sister's love Dai Moroboshi (Shuichi Akai). Amuro starts to gloat saying that he knew Shuichi was FBI and that he couldn't believe that he was killed. He then says he decided to disguise as Shuichi in front of those close to him, although he asked Vermouth to disguise as him on the train. From that, he could only conclude that Shuichi really died. Putting Shiho at gunpoint, he tells her to go into the eighth cart so he can detach it with C4 explosives and bring her back to the organization. However, Shiho reveals that there are more C4 explosives in the train and from there, Amuro realizes that Vermouth put them there and that she plans to have Sherry killed. However, before he can do anything else, the real Shuichi (whom Amuro mistook as Vermouth) comes behind him and throws a grenade to detach the eighth cart. Amuro dodges the explosive relatively unscathed and the eighth cart explodes, but Shiho (who was really Kaitou Kid in disguise) is able to escape. Amuro then regroups with Vermouth and asks her to give him the files on before and after Shuichi's death. He thinks to himself that he'll have to start from square one, while Subaru, who is revealed to be Shuichi Akai watches on silently.

   After the events of the Bell Tree Express, Amuro went on a sick leave which Conan took as a sign that he wasn't planning to return. However, to Conan's horror, Amuro had asked Kogoro if he and
   Sonoko Suzuki
   wanted tennis lessons. He meets them at a tennis court and reveals that he will be coming back to work at the Poirot next week. When a tennis racket accidentally slips from a player's hand, Amuro tries to warn Conan that it will hit him, but Conan is unable to dodge it in time. Conan is knocked unconscious, and Amuro rushes over and does everything to make sure Conan is assisted medically before a real doctor arrives to check Conan's condition.

   A murder case then occurs and Amuro helps with the investigation. As Conan prepares to tranquilize
   Kogoro Mouri
   , Amuro, starting to get suspicious, bends down to examine Conan aiming his watch, which prevents Conan from using it. Conan is instead forced to give out hints to lead Kogoro and the police to the right answer. After solving the case, Amuro and Vermouth have a phone conversation. Vermouth asks why Amuro is still sticking around the Mouri Detective Agency when there is no need to because Sherry has been dealt with, and Amuro responds that he is interested by "Sleeping Kogoro". As he says this, he thinks of Conan instead, implying he suspects Conan is the real Sleeping Kogoro.

Unable to call for help and out of other options, Conan decides to try to get a message to Amuro using the cat and a doctored receipt. The receipt initially blew away, but after realizing it was from Conan, Amuro tracks it down using a specialized app on his phone that can simulate wind conditions between the buildings in Beika city. Amuro locates the delivery truck in his repaired Mazda RX-7. Bourbon then decides decides to pretend like he came by chance instead of decoding the message on the receipt, and asks the two delivery men to make way because the street is narrow. When the kids see him and cry for help, Amuro, playing dumb, asks why they are in that truck. One of the murderers then orders Amuro to get in the truck by threatening the safety of the children. Amuro immediately punches the man's chest so hard that he coughs up blood. The remaining kidnapper backs down and Amuro ties him up and tells Conan to call the police. The children then reveal that they are outside of Professor

   Suspecting that they may hold more valuable information for his investigation, Amuro follows Conan and Jodie to a sakura viewing scenic spot and attempts to approach them using someone else's appearance. He, with Vermouth's assistance, impersonates a random man named Touhei Benzaki. Amuro claims to be the husband of the woman who taped Jodie back in the Bank Robbery Case, where he was also one of the victims himself. He also says that he saw Scar Akai a few days back, to which both of them react strongly. Jodie immediately grabs Amuro's arm and questions him where did that happen, while he takes advantage of the chance and secretly plants an eavesdropping device inside the sleeve of her jacket. Through the eavesdropping device planted earlier, Amuro is able to listen to Jodie's conversations with Conan, where she mentions how Conan assisted the FBI in unmasking

Vermouth, imitating the appearance of the woman who taped Jodie, walks towards them and pretends to have a morning sickness in order to remove the eavesdropping device from Jodie and create an excuse for Amuro to leave the crime scene immediately. Amuro then drives Vermouth away. Inside the car, Vermouth wonders whether he has got hold of something interesting from Jodie. Amuro states that he has learned a "surprising inside story", but would not share the details with Vermouth until he acquires proof. He only comments that Conan is a "terrifying man".

   Sometime later, Conan suspects that the couple who approached him and Jodie was in fact Bourbon and Vermouth in disguise. While panicking, Conan realizes that the slip in Bourbon and Vermouth's story that allowed him to recognize their lie might have been intentional, so that he would realize the truth, panic, and then make a critical mistake. Conan calms down and calls Haibara to confirm whether she has felt any members of the Black Organization lately, not knowing that Amuro is watching him closely from a corner nearby.

   To complete his investigation about Shuichi Akai's "death", Bourbon goes to Haido Central Hospital looking for information about what happened to the spy Rikumichi Kusuda. Unfortunately, Conan lies badly when Amuro asks him if he knew Rikumichi, and Amuro learns that Conan really did know Rikumichi. Later, a child saying "Zero" prompts Amuro to remember a conversation during his childhood between him and Elena Miyano. At the end of the case, Takagi tells Amuro that the police found the damaged car of Kusuda Rikumuchi with lots of blood but the owner was not found. He then deduces that Rikumichi was shot by a gun and commit suicide.

   Bourbon, having deduced the trick that Shuichi Akai used to fake his death, confronts Subaru Okiya at the Kudo house, believing him to be Shuichi in disguise. His colleagues attempt to corner Jodie and Camel in Raiha Pass to make sure Shuichi wouldn't resist capture, only to be foiled by Shuichi himself who has been hiding in the back seat of the car Jodie and Camel are in. It was then explored that Bourbon's real name was Rei Furuya and he is a member of the Japanese National Police Agency Security Bureau Security Planning Division infiltrating the Black Organization. His colleagues in this case also come from the same agency and Shuichi's and Rei's hostility come from an incident involving an unspecified man, about whom Shuichi says he regrets.
