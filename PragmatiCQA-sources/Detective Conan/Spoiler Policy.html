    spoiler
   </b>
   means that a piece of information has been released too early. A spoiler can spoil someone's enjoyment with many things if love'd to enjoy. As example can be given with manga chapters: Someone like to know what is happening in Conan's next case, or the conclusion, or which will be Conan's case next time. The chapters are been released every Wednesday but there are some website that spoil images three or two days before the official publishing date of
   Weekly Shōnen Sunday
   , which that can be ruined by the readers enjoyment of reading the series, which can be set as almost boring or totally boring.

   If a spoiler comes from the manga series, then you must not write it at the Detective Conan Wiki article pages. Do know that you should not spoil things or evenly anything that has been released too early than the official publishing date of the series. If the manga series has been published on their official publishing date, then wait one or two days before creating the chapter article page.
