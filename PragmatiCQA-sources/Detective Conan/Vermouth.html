   20 years ago prior to the current timeline, Vermouth murdered Jodie's Father who had collected information on her on behalf of the FBI. For some reason, Vermouth appears not to age or have de-aged over a period of twenty years, making

   conclude that Sharon and Chris Vineyard are one and the same person.
  </p>
  <p key="a0c233e3-c0c8-4d4c-bdb3-c7d82c23b286">
   One year ago prior to the current timeline, Vermouth disguised herself as a serial killer to hunt Shuichi Akai in New York City. Underestimating Akai's abilities, she gets shot instead and retreats from the scene. While fleeing the area, she meets Ran and Shinichi who saves her life upon accidentally falling from a broken stairwell, regarding the two as "Angel" and "Cool Guy" respectively.
  </p>
  <p key="32d3b7b1-fa1f-465b-acf2-a963b71bb622">
   Vermouth entered the storyline some time after Sherry rebelled against the Black Organization. Vermouth's main objective was to track down and eliminate the 'traitor', and for that purpose she assumed the identity of doctor Tomoaki Araide. Although she managed to discover Shiho's reversion into a child, she did not succeed in killing her as she met Conan, who was able to discover and thwart her plans in collaboration with the FBI.

   At some point Sharon began to pretend to have a daughter named Chris, who she did not got along with after she played a rude prank. While Sharon was still alive, Chris kept out of the public eye except for acting in movies and giving interviews. That fact might have serve as a pretext to why the two 'identities' would not be seen together in public.

   who was infatuated with her. Vermouth is very bold and confident with her abilities, being able to manipulate various situations to her advantage: traits which allow her to single-handedly weave complex plots and take the upper hand even while she is being monitored by enemies.
  </p>
  <p key="df6b2fd4-f707-45dc-9f15-80e734427475">
   Vermouth's personality is contradictory at times. On one hand, she is a cruel and ruthless agent who will do anything to achieve her goals by any means necessary. On the other hand, she risks her life several times to protect Conan, Ran and Kogoro. Vermouth's friendly behavior while in disguise as Tomoaki Araide also left the real Araide wondering if Vermouth is really a bad person. This inconsistency may reflect an underlying conflict of conscience after Shinichi and Ran saved her life during the events of the Golden Apple Case. Vermouth also appears to be an atheist at first as she claims to not believe in God nor angels until Ran unknowingly rescued her, which seemed to have given her back some faith.

   While she does kill people, something suggests that she is not much into killing children.

Furthermore, when she questions a young witness,

  <p key="4ec4706b-724b-4e02-9cf4-dd04fbbfa218">
   Currently, Vermouth's motives are very mysterious. She knows about Conan being Shinichi, as well as that Haibara is Sherry, yet she has kept this information a secret from the rest of the Black Organization. She dislikes the Miyano Family's research. She also retains personal feelings for persons who have earned a special place in her heart, such as Shinichi whom he refers to as "Cool Guy" and Ran whom she calls as "Angel". As a result, she is highly unwilling to do them any harm even when she is ordered to do so.

   Vermouth is quite strong and has developed a high pain tolerance. While she was disguised as a serial killer in New York City, Vermouth athletically vaults up from the railing of the stairwell to a higher ground despite being shot in the side by Akai. At some point, she also shot herself in the leg in order to avoid the effects of sleeping gas, and was able to limp to a phone booth despite being injured, with several broken ribs caused by Akai and with a deep scratch on her right shoulder caused by Jodie.

  <p key="ecbff309-8a02-4e02-90bf-d669a4b5c326">
   Vermouth is also skilled when it comes to firearms. As Vermouth pulled away in Jodie's car with broken ribs after her flak jacket absorbed a close range shotgun blast, she managed to aim a handgun backwards with her left hand. While driving a car she was not used to and by utilizing its side mirror, Vermouth was able to shoot a car's gas tank standing 100 yards away, causing it to explode and prevent the FBI from following her, leaving Akai impressed.

   Vermouth sends a signed off-season Halloween Oarty invitation to Kogoro and Conan addressed for Shinichi Kudo, challenging them to solve a murder on the ship. Conan asks Haibara who is still sick about the name Vermouth, and learns from her reaction that it is the Codename of one of the Black Organization Members. Agasa’s Residence is still bugged and Conan takes advantage of that to manipulate Vermouth into believing he is going to go to the party. Conan knows at this time Vermouth wants to avoid catching him up in her plan to capture Sherry because of the events at New York in the Golden Apple case.

   disguised as Shinichi Kudo under a layer of bandages boards the ghost ship. Vodka in costume boards as well. A murder takes place on the ghost ship as Vermouth said. Back at Agasa's house, Conan has been disguised as Haibara by Yukiko, and he has locked the real Haibara in the basement to keep her safe. However, Conan doesn't know that Haibara broke the lock as she believed that dying at the hands of Vermouth would prevent further complications. Vermouth, as Araide, then calls Agasa’ and initiates her plan believing Haibara should now be alone, and the disguised Conan answers. Araide says he is coming to pick up Haibara since her condition does not seem to get any better, to which Conan agrees.

   Jodie, trying to protect Haibara after hearing Vermouth and Conan's conversation through the bugs, picks up Conan disguised as Haibara before Araide can get there. Araide sees Jodie pulling away and he follows. Conan then notices Araide is following. Unknown to all parties involved, Ran is hiding in Jodie's trunk.

  <p key="a2e1918a-5fab-403f-b545-3623c46eed91">
   During the car ride, Conan tells Jodie that he will trust her if she can force Araide to reveal that she is Vermouth, to which Jodie agrees. Araide and Jodie arrive at the docks. Araide stays in character and Jodie sets a trap for him using the story about the murder at the Araide Residence. Vermouth does not know that the police and the murderer put together a false investigation to protect the maid Hikaru as she was the one who flipped the switch that caused the electrocution. Vermouth falls for the trap and Jodie tells the truth. Araide then removes her mask, revealing her identity as  the Black Organization Member Vermouth.

After Vermouth killed Jodie's father, she inadvertently handled Jodie’s Father’s glasses barehanded which had fallen off of him and got her fingerprints on them. Unexpectedly, a little Jodie came in and saw Vermouth holding the glasses. When Vermouth left after setting the house on fire, she did not anticipate that Jodie left to get juice, taking her father’s glasses with her and thus preserving her fingerprint. After she discovered Jodie's corpse was not found in the house, Vermouth looked for the girl desperately in order to rectify her mistake, but Jodie had since been put into the FBI's Witness Protection Program.

   Back at the Halloween Party, murder on the ghost ship was solved by Hattori Heiji and the murderer reveals someone named Vermouth forced him to commit the crime. The man who had resentment for the victim posted in a murder forum that he wanted to kill him. Someone named Vermouth had replied back and asked if he would be willing to kill the victim if Vermouth provided the technique and the tools to do so. The murderer refused, but then Vermouth mailed him pictures of him and his family, tapes of intercepted phone calls, and detailed notes of the his families' daily actions. The parcel came with a threat that if the man didn't carry out the murder or reported Vermouth to the police, he and his family would die. Vodka overhears this and presumably reports it to Gin who reports to the Boss.
  </p>
  <p key="5cef6459-cea6-4b6b-9353-dc3797ea5bc4">
   It is also revealed that Vermouth visited Araide's Clinic with only a cold intending to kill Araide and impersonate him. The FBI, anticipating Vermouth's agenda, faked Araide and his family’s deaths by having doubles drive his car off the road in front of Vermouth’s car. Vermouth was then fooled and took advantage of the accident to replace Araide.

   Jodie proceeds to ask Vermouth some questions which Vermouth does not answer. Jodie asks if Haibara and the woman in the picture called Sherry are the same person. She then asks about Ran and Conan's pictures, labelled as "Angel" and "Cool Guy" respectively. Jodie also asks why Vermouth protected Conan during the bus jack case. She reveals that Sharon and Chris Vineyard are the same person and asks why Vermouth does not appear to age.

  <p key="59f16d96-42ca-44eb-8bb8-3afae2406f48">
   Jodie then calls out for her fellow FBI Agents to arrest Vermouth. However, Vermouth had come to the spot ahead of time disguised as Jodie and had sent all the FBI Agents waiting out in advance away. Instead, Calvados, a Black Organization Sniper infatuated with Vermouth, is waiting instead and shoots Jodie. Vermouth prepares to kill Jodie but was interrupted when Conan kicks her gun away with a soccer ball and removes his Haibara disguise. The real Haibara also arrives after tracking Conan with the tracing glasses, much to Conan's surprise.

  <p key="b2328f92-cc52-4651-847b-324a1ac0aff7">
   Conan, distracted by Haibara, is shot with his own stun-gun wristwatch by Vermouth. Vermouth then prepares to kill Haibara, telling her "to blame your parents who took over this foolish research." At that moment,  Ran leaps out of Jodie's trunk and tackles Haibara to shield her from the bullets. Vermouth orders Calvados to stop shooting at Ran, and screams at "Angel" to move away from Haibara since she is unwilling to kill Ran because of her rescue during the case in New York.

   Shuichi Akai sneaks up Calvados and disables him. Jodie then moves out of the sniper's range and shoots Vermouth in the shoulder. Akai appears and surprises Vermouth. He proceeds to insult her by calling her a "Rotten Apple" provoking Vermouth to shoot him, but Akai fires with his gun first and wounds Vermouth badly. Akai shows Jodie that the shotgun scared Vermouth's face, revealing that she isn't wearing a mask to hide her age. To escape, Vermouth kidnaps the unconscious Conan and while escaping with Jodie's Car, she shoots the gas tank of her own car to prevent being followed.

   She then receives a text from the Boss telling her, "It looks like I have given you too much freedom. Come back to my side, Vermouth." She replies to the Boss' text and Conan records the sounds of the dialed number. Conan, who has woken up some time before, threatens Vermouth to take him to the Boss or he will transmit the Boss's Cell Phone Number. Vermouth then escapes via sleeping gas and shooting herself in the leg to keep herself awake while Conan dozes off. She destroys the recorder Conan has with him, but he remembers the Boss’s Cell Phone Number by sound anyway. She also leaves her coat on Conan to prevent him from getting cold.

   After escaping from Conan, she calls Gin from a payphone and tells him to pick her up, saying she had been caught by Shuichi Akai and wounded by him. Gin asks her if she knows someone named Shinichi Kudo and she lies, saying she does not know. She leaves with the thought that Shinichi Kudo, since he could touch her heart, might be the Silver bullet that could destroy the Black Organization.

Vermouth then teases Chianti by blowing her a kiss and wishing her good luck to spite her.

Gin then asks her at gunpoint if there is something between her and Kogoro, to which Vermouth answers "My, my, if there was, what would you do?", flaunting her untouchable status as the Boss' Favorite. Vermouth's reply satisfies Gin enough to take his gun off of her, but not enough to call off the murder. Shuichi Akai's timely interference then stops the assassination completely and the Black Organization retreats. While in the car, Vermouth points out that everything that happened so far seemed to be a trap set up by the FBI with Kogoro as the bait. Vermouth's explanation seems to satisfy everyone, however, Gin still has some residual suspicion on Kogoro Mouri.

She discovers that Kir was injured and is most likely in a hospital. Acting on this intelligence, the Black Organization began dispatching agents to search hospitals in secret.

Bourbon asked Vermouth for her disguise assistance, and also made a promise to Vermouth, perhaps in exchange for her help. The Boss then approved their plan out of an abundance of caution, however, Vermouth and Bourbon failed to tell Gin and the other members about it.

   When Bourbon uncovered a video of Shiho Miyano showing that she was going to be on the Bell Tree Express, he reported it to Vermouth, who then relays it to Gin. While Gin and Vermouth converse about the discovery, he was pleased and confided that she might have been hiding sympathy for Shiho. Vermouth tells Gin that showing mercy for Shiho is nonsense, and orders him not to interfere with her plans until the train arrives at its final destination. Bourbon and Vermouth then decided to team up in order to capture Shiho. Although Bourbon wanted to capture Shiho alive, Vermouth intended to kill her and had altered Bourbon's plan without telling him.

   so they could get her out of the way and intimidate Shiho into fleeing to part of the train where Bourbon would lay in wait. Vermouth figured that Haibara would take an antidote and revert back to Shiho to avoid revealing her de-aged state, and she would then run away from her friends to prevent them from being placed in danger. Strategically placed smoke canisters would simulate a fire in the back carriages of the train. The known pyrophobic along with Bourbon yelling fire, would cause all the other passengers to evacuate forward while Shiho would run towards the back of the train to end her misery. Bourbon would then confront her alone in the back carriage, knock her out, move her to the luggage car, and detach it with a small bomb so that a helicopter trailing the train could retrieve her alive. This would also stop the train from arriving at the final destination in Nagoya where Gin has planted a large amount of C-4 to blow the entire train up. Unbeknownst to Bourbon, Vermouth had already modified his plan by filling the luggage car with Gin's leftover C-4 so she could detonate the bombs and kill Shiho as soon as Bourbon detached the carriage.

Vermouth's expectations also did not include Conan, Yukiko, and

   Meanwhile, Bourbon informs Vermouth about Masumi and prepares to intercept the obstacle. Yukiko then crosses paths with Vemrouth and challenges her to a "Battle of Wits" where Vermouth would have to truly give up on Shiho forever if Conan outsmarted her on the train. Vermouth then confronts Masumi, knocks her out with a stun gun, and moves her in an isolated room. Vermouth then mails Bourbon that she had "removed the obstacle, so the rest should go as planned".

   Fearing Yukiko's plan, Vermouth looks up Yukiko's room on the passengers list and searches through her cabin. She finds supplies that Yukiko seemed to be intending to use and disguise as Shiho to fake her death, which Vermouth disposes out of the train. Yukiko then confronts Vermouth directly by calling her "Sharon" and Vermouth immediately rips off her Scar Akai mask. Vermouth then expresses her surprise on how Yukiko is involved in the battle between Conan and the Black Organization. Yukiko then taunts Vermouth over her un-aging state, and that the great "Sharon Vineyard" was nothing more than makeup. Vermouth, who seems to be dodging the topic of her un-aging state, proceeds to question Yukiko about her plan. Yukiko teasingly reveals a few details such as Masumi being retrieved from Vermouth's room already. Yukiko then returns to the topic of Vermouth's un-aging, explaining that her side has an advantage over Vermouth since for some unknown reason, Vermouth does not want her un-aging state revealed and has kept Conan's and Haibara's state a secret from the Black Organization. Yukiko continues by drawing the connection to Suguru Itakura, a CG Creator who had worked with Sharon before in some movies containing visual effects. Concluding her explanation, Yukiko states that Vermouth had ordered some software from Itakura and wonders if the program is relevant to Vermouth's state and secret-keeping.

   Not wanting to continue with Yukiko's line of questioning, Vermouth cuts Yukiko off by drawing her gun, revealing that she has seen through her "fruitcake of a plan". Vermouth explains how she knew Yukiko intended to disguise as Shiho and pretend to be killed, and she ruined it by throwing all Yukiko's disguise materials out. When Yukiko gets a call from Conan, Vermouth takes the phone from Yukiko and answers it with her voice. Conan, pretending to be panicked, announces he can't find Haibara anywhere. Falsely thinking Conan was deceived, Vermouth hangs up, and then explains her and Bourbon's plan to Yukiko. Vermouth activates the smoke canisters, and as predicted, everyone flees to the front of the train to avoid the fire except for "Shiho", who is actually Kaitou Kid in disguise, who runs to the back of the train. Bourbon then confronts her there and forces the fake Shiho into the luggage car, where she reveals that Vermouth had tricked Bourbon and planted bombs to kill her. Bourbon tries to get Shiho to leave with him, but Shiho shuts herself in, and Akai separates the train cars like Bourbon originally intended with a grenade. Hearing the explosion, Vermouth triggers her bombs to detonate and blow up the luggage car that the fake Shiho is in. Yukiko then acts defeated and Vermouth leaves the train triumphant. When the train stops prematurely, Vermouth quickly disguises herself as a woman with braids to avoid recognition and realizes she had been tricked when she sees Haibara exhausted over Agasa's shoulder. She figures out

   had posed as Shiho Miyano and escaped the luggage car before it exploded. She also realizes that Conan had feigned ignorance on the phone earlier so that Yukiko could continue stalling her in the room. She then congratulates Yukiko for "excellent casting". Bourbon, who had seen the figure of Akai through the smoke, asks Vermouth if he can review the files on Akai's death again, to which Vermouth agrees.
