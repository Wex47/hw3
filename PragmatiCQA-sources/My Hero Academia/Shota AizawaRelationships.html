   Shota and Hizashi used to be classmates at U.A. and were good friends for a very long time. Hizashi even came up with the hero name "Eraser Head" for him.

   Since then, he and Nemuri appear on good terms and they often help each other, like when he asked her to help his class in matters he couldn't be bothered with. They usually had a good relationship, and Shota doesn't bother with Nemuri's "enthusiastic" attitude towards youth, but he is annoyed when she would makes decisions for him without his consent.

  <p key="d2008cac-816d-405c-bf61-ca5d627c8ade">
   This behavior is the main reason why Shota is a member of the U.A. teaching staff. When Nemuri was personally requested by principal

   As the homeroom teacher of U.A.'s Class 1-A, Shota cares a lot about the safety and well-being of his students, willing to sacrifice his own life to protect them from danger. He has very high standards for his students when it comes to heroism, and seriously pushes them in that regard. Although he rarely gives praise, he expects great things from all of them and he knows how to recognize when they do a good job.
  </p>
  <p key="1546ac3a-c8bf-4759-934f-87c57ee1ad41">
   However, he is also extremely strict and does not hesitate to criticize and scold them when they do not meet their expectations or make bad decisions, never pulls his punches with the truth, especially when it comes to pointing out flaws or naivete. His stern demeanor also makes it harder for his students to determine whether or not he is being sincere in his teaching methods, so when he threatens them with "rational falsehoods" like expulsions or punishments to force them to exert themselves to the fullest, they mistake him for being serious and understandably get scared.

   Unfortunately, a week later Oboro died after being crushed by a pile of rubble in a confrontation against a villain, who was defeated by Shota alone. During the fight, Shota heard how his friend was always cheering him on, but after his victory, he founds out that Oboro was already dead before he started fighting, and Sensoji tells him it was likely he was giving himself a pep talk and the stress situation made him imagine it was Oboro. Shota, along with Hizashi, mourned the loss of his friend.

   Even today, despite the years that have passed, Shota still remembers his former classmate. Hizashi suggests that one of the reasons for his interest in training Hitoshi, aside from Shota seeing his young self in him, is also because of Oboro.

   Sensoji was a student of Class 2-B with whom he did not get along. He had an arrogant personality, and he used to despise Shota by considering him a weakling and having an equally weak Quirk. Although Shota did not usually consider him a smart one, and he generally ignored his provocations, since at that time he was going through a crisis, having serious doubts about his ability to be a hero, he could not deny that there was a certain truth in his words.

   However, thanks to Oboro's support, Shota improved his combat ability, and at some point during training, between him and Oboro, they managed to defeat Sensoji. Still, Shota did not consider it a fair fight, arguing that a two-on-one is not fair, and tried to have the fight end in good terms between the two, but Sensoji considered his defeat to Shota humiliating and despised his mercy.
  </p>

   Despite this enmity, when Shota defeated Garvey alone, Sensoji did not hesitate to congratulate him and acknowledge that he had accomplished an outstanding feat and that he should be proud of it. After this incident, their relationship improved a lot. Sensoji no longer antagonized Shota neither got angry when Shota defeated him in training battle and even thanked him for his advice.

   Due to the Nomu's ability to retain personality traits of their past life, Naomasa and Gran Torino plan to try to wake up Oboro with some attachments he had toward his old life, making Shota and Hizashi personally interview him. The villain does not react to seeing them and does not seem to remember anything when he was Oboro, but his genuine concern for others (in his case Tomura Shigaraki) and the fact that he describes himself as the type of person who cannot abandon others, confirms Shota that he is really his friend Oboro.
