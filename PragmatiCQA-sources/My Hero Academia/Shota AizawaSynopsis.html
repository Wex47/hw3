   Sometime during his adolescent years, Shota attended

    Oboro Shirakumo
   </a>
   , with whom he would make friends, and they would end up being called "the three dumbigos of Class A".
   One day, while picking their hero names, Shota was unable to decide so Hizashi chose the name "Eraser Head" for him.
  </p>
  <p key="2d574ce1-52e6-46df-bc51-bc7ba023ace2">
   During his second year, Shota began to have doubts about his ability to become a hero, feeling even unable to save a kitten he found abandoned on a rainy day when he was on his way to the U.A. The only thing he could do at that moment was to leave his umbrella to protect it and continue his walk to the high school. Once in his homeroom class, his friend Hizashi, seeing his glum mood, tries to cheer him up without much success.
  </p>
  <p key="8ad6679d-c919-43ea-8c56-c0fdb0013ac4">
   Suddenly, Oboro arrives through the homeroom class window, using a

    Quirk
   </a>
   , making jokes about Shota and Hizashi and interrupting roll call, being admonished by the teacher. Oboro was another classmate with whom Shota maintained a good relationship. Oboro gives back Shota’s umbrella, and when he is about to ask him if anything was underneath, Oboro pulled out a cat he rescued earlier from the rain, which is met with adoration from his classmates. Shota realized that it's the same kitten he left under his umbrella.
  </p>
  <p key="025a0023-2f9c-40fc-8a45-e0931c1ad9ca">
   After finishing the roll call, the homeroom teacher reminded the students soon to participate in the
   <a href="Hero WorkStudies.html" key="4b586131-a602-4966-88e9-bb3425b0b34a" title="Hero Work-Studies">
    Hero Work-Studies
   </a>
   , putting special emphasis on Shota, Oboro, and Hizashi since none of them have been assigned to an agency as of yet. After this, the whole Class 2-A did joint practical exercises with Class 2-B. In one of the exercises, Shota had problems with another student named
   Sensoji
   , who ridicules him for his uselessness and weak Quirk, before being separated by the teacher. The homeroom teacher knows that Shota has these problems because he is still uncertain about his future as a hero.
  </p>
  <p key="7a6f5fdf-68ea-4f55-aa45-4cab71b6f4c9">
   Later, on one of the rooftops of the U.A., Shota talked with Oboro and Hizashi about his personal doubts. Oboro advised him to specialize in the battler route because he believes that Shota's Erasure can be very useful in a fight. Shota doubts his partner's statements, although the conversation changes radically when he sees that Oboro feeds the kitten with human food. Then he reminds Oboro and Hizashi that bringing animals to school is against the rules. At that moment, the third-year student
   <a href="Nemuri Kayama.html" key="0b003cd6-e09f-4e79-8207-e90bec0abc75" title="Nemuri Kayama">
    Nemuri Kayama
   </a>
   appeared, joining their conversation, and ends up adopting the kitten. The next day, Shota and Oboro talked about how Hizashi finally got assigned to an agency. Nemuri appeared again and informed them that her boss,
   His Purple Highness
   , was willing to accept them in his agency.
  </p>
  <p key="5c2c23cd-fc77-4d78-ae18-847dd1937af8">
   Shota and Oboro accepted their offer, and thus, began their Work-Studies at Purple Revolution Agency, with Nemuri and His Purple Highness. One day, while patrolling, Shota tried to stop a
   <a href="Villains.html" key="754044d9-5e03-44e9-8f12-88cff9902a1d" title="Villains">
    villain
   </a>
   who has just made a robbery, but the criminal has a Quirk that allows him to generate
   smoke
   , and he used it against Shota, blinding him and preventing him from using his Erasure on him. His Purple Highness came to Shota's aid before he could get hurt, but the villain managed to escape. His Purple Highness criticized Shota, not for not stopping the villain, but for acting like a hero with a gloomy face. Mr. Purple advised him that if he wants to be a hero, he must inspire confidence, and for that, he must trust his own power and smile.
  </p>
  <p key="5e6dabb1-2c29-4a6d-87a0-a96d76262b13">
   Back to the Purple Revolution Agency, Shota reflected on Mr. Purple's words. It was good advice, but it is impossible for him to smile if he does not do his job well as a hero, to which his friend Oboro reassured him just to keep smiling even if you screw up. Then, when they talked about what would he do against the Villain if he encounters him again, Oboro came up with the idea of lending Shota his goggles to protect his eyes from the villain's smoke.
  </p>
  <p key="94918d9e-e01b-4af1-880c-296ef8958c80">
   A few days later, while patrolling
   they spotted the same Villain
   again. This time, thanks to the Oboro's goggles, Shota was not affected by the Villain’s Quirk, being able to use his Erasure on him without problems. The
   Robber Villain
   tried to attack, but Oboro suddenly appeared and knocked him out with a blow of his quarterstaff. Shota and Oboro successfully immobilized the Villain and His Purple Highness and the bystanders praised them for their work.
  </p>
  <p key="5f875609-8158-46e1-8c12-a7b5ce5b2732">
   When the Work-Studies period ended, they returned to the U.A., where they met with their colleague Hizashi, who pointed out to Shota that he wore the same type of goggles as Oboro, and Shota clarified that he lent them to protect his eyes. For some reason, this bothers Sensoji, who had a similar idea, wearing shades to prevent being blinded by his own Quirk
   Blast
   , and accused Shota of copying his idea. Shota preferred to ignore him.
  </p>
  <p key="07ccb339-5fa5-47d3-9df0-7fb65a132faa">
   At
   Ground Beta
   , their homeroom teacher organized a battle royale in pairs. Shota and Oboro formed a team, and end up facing Sensoji and Hizashi. However, the first, letting himself be carried away by his antipathy towards Shota, decided to
   face both of them alone
   . Using his Quirk, Oboro manages to disorient Sensoji, allowing Shota to stand behind him and nullify his Blast Quirk with his Erasure. Taking advantage of the situation, Oboro knocked down Sensoji with his quarterstaff, causing him to lose his shades. Sensoji wants to continue, but Shota stopped him, arguing that a two-on-one is not a fair fight and tried to return to him his shades. Sensoji can not stand the defeat and broke the shades before stomping out of the class. The homeroom teacher complimented Shota and Oboro for their teamwork and lecture Sensoji for his behavior.
  </p>
  <p key="6ae9905f-49df-4a65-8e99-40531a734baa">
   Later, Shota was hanging out with Oboro and Hizashi. Oboro talked about his plans for the future in which the three of them, after graduating from the U.A. and go independent, they should start their own
   <a href="Hero Office.html" key="9fb819b9-921d-4976-83ef-54abd28027ca" title="Hero Office">
    Hero Office
   </a>
   . Oboro explained that he and Hizashi would start the combat, something for which Shota is not suitable but he would be the edge in battle thanks to his Erasure, allowing him or Hizashi the final blow. Shota asked Oboro if what he has said about him is just another way to say that he can't do anything on his own, but Oboro clarified he is suited to teamwork. Shota was not very convinced with the Oboro's plan, which made both he and Hizashi tease him and his broody act. Nemuri showed up and the conversation drifted to a topic that is none of Shota's business, so he decided to let his friends enjoy the moment, while he contemplated the sky, feeling how things were changing.
  </p>
  <p key="ec1a8153-4f10-4f6c-9fda-900ddb8c8919">
   A week later, Shota, Oboro, and Nemuri have returned along with His Purple Highness to continue with the Work-Studies. Shota is patrolling Tasomiya Ward with Oboro when they meet a group of nursery kids. Oboro creates a cloud to lend them a ride while Shota guides them and makes sure their group looks both ways before crossing. Oboro compliments Shota, saying he's a natural with kids and suggest he should work at a daycare or be a school teacher but Shota claims he has no attributes for kids to like the way he acts, but he is proven wrong when after the duo and kids say their goodbyes, one of the children say goodbye personally to Shota.
  </p>
  <p key="21fde8cf-0ec6-426c-b507-8c7a48423c02">
   Oboro says to Shota he needs to stop psyching himself out and that he can do anything if he puts his mind to it. Shota doesn't believe he's good enough to work at a daycare or be a teacher, although he considers Oboro's words, The conversation is interrupted when Shota receives a call from Nemuri, warning them to start evacuating the area immediately because a villain named
   Garvey
   is wrecking the neighborhood.
  </p>
  <p key="4a8d6991-50e9-4907-b3dd-4d8b235cd7be">
   Shota and Oboro quickly return to the nursery kids to evacuate them, but Garvey arrives much sooner than they would have expected. Mr. Purple appears and tries to buy them some time so they can put the children safe, but he is easily defeated by the villain thanks to his
   Stock
   Quirk. The attacks cause serious damage to a nearby building, which begins to crumble over the children. Oboro creates a cloud to protect them, saving their lives, but by doing so he cannot protect himself and ends up crushed by the rubble. Shota screams for Oboro with no response causing the kids to cry.
  </p>
  <p key="f5e81ccd-be31-4fad-85bd-c923e0ee3a37">
   It starts to rain harder and harder. With Oboro and Mr. Purple defeated, only Shota Aizawa remains to protect the children from the villain. However, Shota doesn't know what to do to stop him. He starts to doubt himself when he hears Oboro's voice through his speaker cheering him on. This gives him a boost of confidence to face the villain,
   being able to defeat him alone after
   an arduous battle
   , where Oboro never stopped encouraging him through the communicator device.
  </p>
  <p key="121ee2eb-f3da-42cf-9b7a-74ffdab76098">
   Shota is being praised for defeating the villain alone, but he that insisted his friend Oboro cheered him on during the entire fight, and wants him to get treated for his wounds as soon as they can. However, he notices that something is fishy when he sees Nemuri and Hizashi are grief-stricken, and Sensoji explains that he could not hear anything from the speaker since it is completely busted, telling him it was likely he was giving himself a pep talk and imagine it was Oboro. Shota brushes Sensoji‘s comment off and looks over the fallen rubble where Oboro was knocked out, only to find out his friend in a body bag, stained with blood, and finally realizes the terrible truth: Oboro Shirakumo is dead.
  </p>
  <p key="784e4ee6-c36b-4055-9200-91e355edc8dd">
   The body is removed and the rain intensifies. After several minutes Nemuri tells Shota and Hizashi to take cover. Hizashi thanks her for worrying about them but replies the rain fits the mood they're in. While contemplating the area where Oboro died, Shota remembers all the moments he spent with him, and with Hizashi by his side, they mourn the loss of their friend.
  </p>
  <p key="c37ae28c-137a-4759-9432-9f3cc369a0d5">
   The death of Oboro caused a strong impact on him, and until he graduated from the U.A. Shota intensified his solo training, barely interacting with his classmates. His teachers were a bit worried about him. Even though his grades were above average, the only thing he put effort into is battle training. They thought he has become too complacent for his own good, an opinion that was reinforced when, in a conversation with his homeroom teacher, he declared that he would start his own
   <a href="Hero Office.html" key="86659777-3f23-4d4a-ab88-c672e27173ef" title="Hero Office">
    Hero Agency
   </a>
   as soon as he graduates from U.A. High School. The teacher tried to convince him not to rush but Shota replies that he wants to be is an independent, underground hero, specializing in anti-villains combat.
  </p>
  <p key="00ab1753-f81b-4f2a-bf75-688994aab7f6">
   Once he graduated and acquired his diploma, Shota began his Pro Hero career as Eraser Head that will lead him to obstacles, villains and allies along the way.

   After defeating them and putting him in police custody, Shota thanks Knuckleduster for his assistance but finds his actions to be dangerous. Knuckleduster does not mind helping since he is a "virtuous citizen" and thus it is natural to cooperate with Heroes. Knuckleduster believes that Heroes need people like him so that the incident with the Instant Villains will not happen again since he is free to deliver justice without restrictions. Shota finds it ridiculous that Knuckleduster believes his unlawful justice are crimes of conscience and finds him to be a troublesome old man.

Faced with his attitude, Koichi asks if he got something against cats, because he has avoided looking at it.

He ensnares Koichi in his Capturing Weapon, pulling him toward him and quicky bracing up some of his fractured limbs he received as a result of the fight. He confronts Koichi over proving him right that he'd end up breaking his bones if he kept meddling like this. He continues to tell the Vigilante that he knows Number 6 is after him, so they have to use him as bait for now, but he'll be there to back him up. After mentioning nobody has a good Quirk to take him down currently, Koichi asks about his Erasure, which he responds that enemies that glow bright prevent proper visual confirmation, so it won't work.

   Koichi and Eraser Head continue to give chase, constantly dodging and evading Number 6's attacks. As it escalates, the civilians of Naruhata watch on, all recognizing "The Cruller" fighting the giant villain, cheering him on to succeed and defeat it. Eraser Head comments on Koichi's "popularity", clarifying it not as a compliment, as it's not only making the citizens evacuate slower, but also riling Number 6 up. Sure enough, he is right as Number 6 proceeds to scream out in despair, his power overloading his brain to the point that he explodes, splitting out into numerous mini bombers that begin to blow up all throughout the city.

   Eraser Head and Koichi hang on the side of a building as the rest of the Pros deal with mitigating the damage and protecting the civilians. Eraser Head then notices something going on in the rubble below, so jumps downward to it. Soon enough, the arrival of All Might and Endeavor is enough to dispel the threat of the mini bombers, saving the city.

   At the same time, Eraser Head frees a child from under the rubble, telling their family to get to safety, before resting for a moment. He's congratulated by Present Mic, surprised since rescues aren't usually his thing and not so "rational", but Eraser Head claims the citizen's safety is the top priority, so it is the "rational" decision. Present Mic heads back out with Mister Blaster for recon, reminding Eraser Head to look after The Crawler, only to notice him now missing. He then finds him knocked unconscious on a rooftop, before taking him to the hospital for his injuries.

   After dealing with the fallout of the "Naruhata Lockdown", Eraser Head returns to his usual duties, while Koichi accepts a proposal to move to America and become Captain Celebrity's Sidekick, known as "The Skycrawler". A year later his controversial escapades are broadcast over back into Japan, which Eraser Head ends up hearing about, all the while continuing to look up into the clouds and thinking about Oboro.

Shota confronts them himself, telling them to stop disturbing his students because All Might is not on campus. He returns to homeroom and informs Class 1-A that he has reviewed the results of combat training. First, he tells Katsuki that he is talented and not to sulk over his loss childishly so he does not waste his potential. Then he tells Izuku to work harder to gain control over his Quirk because it can be useful if he gets a grip on it.

He gives them until the end of the week to make their choices and dismisses them from class.

   Following the end of the internships, Shota mentions during class that summer vacation is approaching and Class 1-A will be training at a lodge in the forest. The students are very excited about this news, but whoever does not pass the final exams at the end of the term will have to serve in remedial school instead.

   Sometime later, Shota tells his class about the upcoming Parents' Day, where one of each of their parents will be showing up to observe their classes for the day, and that they will also need to write an essay talking about what they love about their parent that they'll have to present in front of the class, to everyone's slight embarrassment. Shota's real plan for Parents' Day is to put on a performance to make the students' believe their parents have been captured by a villain (played by a disguised All Might), that they must rescue. Several days before, he calls up each individual parent to let them know about the plan in advance. In regards to the Todoroki family, he's unable to contact Endeavor so faxes the information to him, when Shoto's sister, Fuyumi, calls to say she will be going in her family's stead. She also asks if she could record it for their mother to see, but Shota says no. As this is all going on, Present Mic, Midnight, and the rest of the teachers are discussing about Shota's plan and go off on their own tangents regarding what they would do as villains, which Shota is both annoyed and intrigued by. On Parents' Day, Shota fakes a disappearance, leading to confusion from the students, even more so when they encounter the "villain". After they successfully execute the rescue plan, Shota makes himself known, revealing the deception and intention behind the whole ordeal. He also says the letters were a way for the students' to have the thoughts of their love for their parents fresh in their minds. He then goes to Shoto and Fuyumi, telling them that they did record the incident for observation purposes, allowing them to give to their mother to watch.

Later on, when Katsuki storms out of class, Shota notices that he has gotten worse. Shota oversees the written exams and meets with his class at the practical exam area after. Shota and several other teachers remind the students that it is possible to fail the practical. Some of the students have gathered information and know what to expect from the final. Denki and

   A few days before, Shota met with all the teachers to discuss changing the practical test. In order to reflect the current times where battles against villains look to intensify, they believe make the final exam more difficult is necessary. Shota noted that they can ignore complaints about student safety, as that is the reason they utilized robots in the past. With the final say, Nezu agrees they should change the test to teachers against pairs of students in order to make the students as strong as possible. Shota explained his reasoning for each of the matchups. He decided to take on Shoto and Momo himself to teach them not to rely so heavily on their Quirks. He also assigns Izuku and Katsuki to All Might in order to help mend their broken relationship.
  </p>
  <p key="8ed20226-259b-452b-86c3-f620fbddca45">
   All of the matchups between student pairs and teachers are revealed in order. The students must either capture the teachers using handcuffs are run away by getting through a designated escape gate within thirty minutes.
   This is to simulate situations where heroes must choose to fight or run to get help. Shota believes Izuku, Shoto, and Tenya know full well about needing to run and get help because of their interaction with the hero killer. Each teacher wears ultra compressed weights to give the students a handicap. Shota tells everyone it is time to begin and whoever is waiting to fight can watch in the monitoring room or strategize with their partners.

   Eraser Head portrays the role of a villain in the practical battle against Shoto and Momo. He finds them with their guard down and takes them by surprise by hanging by his scarf from telephone cables. He takes their Quirks from them and tells them to prioritize evasion. Shoto orders Momo to run for the gate while he swings and misses at his opponent.

   Unimpressed with Shoto's plan, Eraser Head swiftly binds him using the capturing weapon and suspends him in mid-air from the cables. Shoto claims he can free himself at any moment, so Eraser Head responds by throwing caltrops beneath him and warning him to watch where he lands. Before departing to chase Momo, Eraser Head takes the time to tell Shoto his plan places too much burden on himself. He says was nice of Shoto to be considerate of the girl, but they should have talked it over more first.

   Traveling along the telephone cables, Eraser Head uses his restraining bonds to move quickly through the replica city. He catches up to Momo before long and tries to restrain her, but he is unable to keep her Quirk erased and so she escapes. Despite getting free, she runs back towards Shoto rather than towards the escape gate. Shota knows Momo lost her confidence after the Sports Festival and by comparing herself to Shoto, she deems him the better student and doubts her own instincts and abilities. He would like to help her get her confidence back, but "that is not [his] job at the moment," and continues chasing her.

   Momo reaches Shoto, but Eraser Head is not far behind her. Shoto takes his teacher's advice and encourages Momo to form a plan. When Shota reaches them, Momo stuns him with a flurry of flash grenades. She frees Shoto and tells him that she has a plan to pass the exam. Excited to see his students redemption, Shota wipes his eyes and smirks at his opponents.

   Due to his injuries from fighting Nomu, Shota cannot use his Quirk for as long and has to rest more between erasures. He commends Momo for noticing that and planning her attack accordingly. They both run away to put distance between them and Shota. They're not fast enough to escape him, but Shota is unable to keep their Quirks erased. This allows Shoto to block his visibility completely by using his biggest move:

While his students strategize behind the ice, Shota remains in place to watch their approach because the escape gate is behind him. He recalls Momo telling Shoto about her plan to win and admits he is excited to see it.

   Momo and Shoto run from behind the ice, covered in cloaks. Shota cannot erase their Quirks if they are disguised but attacks anyway because it is a disadvantage for them as well. He restrains them with his scarf, but upper bodies turn out to be just mannequins. Momo uses a hidden catapult to send bundled up restraining bonds at Eraser Head, then Shoto shoots out his flames to heat them up. Momo tells Shota the bonds are made from nitinol alloy: a is a metal with shape memory. When heated it returns to its bundled shape in an instant and ties up Eraser Head.

   After the battle, Momo and Shoto discuss how smoothly her plan went. Momo admits she missed the catapult trigger and Eraser Head could have stopped them. She claims that perhaps he allowed them to win. Shota explains that while Momo was revealed, he backed off because Shoto was still cloaked and could have frozen him. Shota is handcuffed by his students and Team Todoroki &amp; Yaoyorozu pass their final exam.

No one managed to fail the written exam, but two teams and Hanta all failed the practical. The teachers left a window for the students to win during the practical battles and only told the students they were trying to defeat them to put them on edge. The training camp is meant to build student strength, so those who bombed the practical need that training the most.

Eventually, Present Mic learns of the two hanging out, and joins in, along with Midnight and Thirteen, and later the rest of the U.A. staff, as they all get into drunken shenanigans. When the sober Toshinori attempts to leave, Shota stops him before sincerely thanking him for fighting in Kamino and saving his students, which Toshinori is happy about, even though he notices Shota was talking to a daruma doll the entire time. Present Mic reveals that Shota's actually a pretty bad drunk, and just forgets about it whenever he falls asleep.

   Ten days before the beginning of the second semester, Shota is glad that everyone arrived safely. He tells Class 1-A that at the training camp they were supposed to get their "Provisional Hero Licenses" but due to the League of Villains' attack, they did not. Shota is disappointed that some of them tried to act like they have their licenses; Shota calls out Shoto, Eijiro, Izuku, Momo, and Tenya. Shota tells them that he knows that they were present at the site of Katsuki's rescue and took it upon themselves to rescue him. The rest of Class 1-A are shocked and surprised that they actually went to rescue Katsuki.
  </p>
  <p key="dc736a89-c7ab-4f63-aed1-d3c2f58fb0f9">
   He also knows that the rest of Class 1-A except Katsuki, Toru, and Kyoka also knew about their plan to rescue Katsuki. He explains that their actions have been covered up but tells them that if All Might did not retire, he would have expelled them all as punishment, with the exception of Katsuki, Toru, and Kyoka. Shota advises them to go through the proper procedures next time, which will also restore the trust between them.

  <p key="5570c54a-c59b-4969-b3e8-56223b935be5">
   After Class 1-A's mood has become better as a result of Katsuki's actions, Shota shows them their new dormitory;

   has one dorm per class and Shota takes them to the Class 1-A dormitory. Shota explains that their dorm is separated by gender: the right wing for females and left wing for males. However, the first floor is common space and contains the dining area, baths, and laundry facilities. Class 1-A take a look at their new dorm and become excited about living here. Shota then explains that their bedrooms are on floors two, three, four and five; every student gets their own private bedroom with each room having an AC unit, bathroom, refrigerator and closet. Shota gives Class 1-A a map of their room allocations and says that their luggage has already been sent into their allocated rooms. Shota ends his explanation by telling Class 1-A to spend the rest of the day unpacking and organizing their rooms. Tomorrow, he will explain the operations of their new lifestyle.
  </p>
  <p key="779a3163-207f-4299-9b3e-9c5a5a42b860">
   The day after, Shota re-emphasizes that the classes’ priority is earning their licenses, and impresses upon them both the seriousness of the responsibilities that come with it and the difficulty of passing the exam. He then announces that the students will be creating

   Shota explains to Class 1-A that the Hero License Exam is designed to test the students' aptitudes such as information gathering, judgment, mobility, leadership, and communication in various types of trouble. However, the aptitude that is most prevalent is fighting ability.

   's purpose, before being abruptly brought to an end, was to help develop their special moves. Shota decides that the remaining ten days they have of summer break Class 1-A that in addition to creating their special moves, he advises them to consider upgrading their Hero Costumes to aid them in the creation of their special moves. Shota tells the class that they will spend the remainder of the summer perfecting ultimate moves before the second semester begins will be entirely spent on developing their Quirks and creating their special moves. Shota also tells that they should also think about costume upgrades. With that said, the class begins training by fighting against Ectoplasm clones.

   All Might appears at the entrance to the gym. Shota tells him he should focus on recovering but All Might replies that it is his job as a teacher to oversee the training of his students. He gives out advice to the students to help them develop their special moves. Shota wonders why that sudden interest in helping students when he looks on a book sticking out of his back pocket. It is titled "Even Dummies can be Teachers! Easy Education Theory". Shota is stunned.

   in the midst of training, All Might shows up and Shota Aizawa tells him that Class 1-A is progressing nicely. However, a rock Katsuki used his AP Shot on cracks and begins falling towards All Might. Katsuki and Shota warn All Might, but Izuku jumps out with One For All: Full Cowl activated. Izuku destroys the falling wall with a single kick.
   Shota Aizawa asks All Might to move to safety; All Might apologizes to Katsuki Bakugo.

   At some point during the period of time before the License Exam, the students of Class 1-A found themselves enraptured in a ghost story, as they start to hear weird buzzing and noises in the middle of the night. Due to it effecting his class, Shota finally addressed the issue to try and bring them back to their usual selves. During their descriptions, he's reminded of one of the "Seven Mysteries of U.A.", where a ghost of an alum who couldn't become a hero haunts the campus, which just makes things even worse for the students. Shota goes to check on everything that night, not wanting to write off everything as "mass hallucination", but also insisting there to be some rational answer to their worries. He eventually discovers the source of the noise, but because of a wet towel cloth left on the counter, he slips and hits his head, knocking him unconscious. This leads to a series of events that spur the students into more of a panic, until he finally wakes up and is able to set things straight. He figures out the noise is a floating black orb which was designed by Mei Hatsume as part of their "anti-peeping security" to halt Minoru from entering the girls' bathroom. While everyone's relieved at the results, Shota is furious at them letting a ghost story get to them this badly, ordering them to write an apology and issuing a curfew for a week.

   The remaining days of training came and went. On the morning of the Provisional Hero Licensing Exam, Class 1-A travels to the Takoba National Stadium. Some of Class 1-A are nervous, but Shota encourages them to do their best so that they can get their licenses and further their goal of becoming Heroes.

   Eijiro gets hyped up and initiates a Plus Ultra chant, but is interrupted when Inasa Yoarashi appears and chants it himself. One of his classmates tells him that he shouldn't barge in like that. Inasa apologizes by slamming his head into the ground and loudly proclaims that he's sorry. Inasa energetically expresses his excitement about competing with U.A. and wishes Class 1-A the best of luck. As the other students of Shiketsu High and Inasa leave, Shota tells Class 1-A that the energetic student's name is Inasa Yoarashi and states that he is a powerful contender; at U.A.'s entrance exam, the same year Class 1-A took it, Inasa received the top score and passed. However, despite receiving the top score, Inasa declined his admission offer.
  </p>
  <p key="e83de0bb-9fb8-4841-93e7-f1f3ec14ed9e">
   Hanta is confused as to why Inasa would refuse enrollment into U.A. even though he admires the school. Shota replies that while Inasa can be awkward, his strength is great and warns Class 1-A to be careful. Suddenly, a female hero approaches Shota and states that it has been a long time since they’ve seen each other, although Shota seems upset about her presence. She is Emi Fukukado, known as “Smile Hero” Ms. Joke and tries to make him laugh and flirts with him, but Shota shoots down all of her advances. When Tsuyu comments about their closeness,
   Ms. Joke
   replies that it is because their workplaces were close to each other, working together several times, and ended up falling in love. Shota denies the part about them being lovers.
  </p>
  <p key="c4ed6c3c-3f13-4d4c-a641-f25855d94794">
   In order for her to stop joking, Shota asks her what she is doing there. She replies that she is a teacher from Ketsubutsu Academy, and she is there with her students, who also participate in the exam. After the students of both schools introduced each other. Shota tells his students to get ready for the exam, and Emi asks if he told his class about something that happens every year at the Provisional Hero License Exam and Shota replies that he hasn’t.
  </p>
  <p key="82f834df-3e3e-44d3-ae9b-a82f2cd2911d">
   Later, watching from the bleachers, Ms. Joke sits near Shota and jokes about his fly being down, to his displeasure, but soon she changes the subject and remarks she is surprised that he hasn't expelled any of his students and wonders if Shota likes his current class, although Shota is indifferent about Class 1-A, much to Ms. Joke’s laughter.
  </p>
  <p key="fd0b4273-ddad-42c5-b7b7-51b9b7b22aff">
   The preliminary round of the Provisional Hero License Exam begins. Emi decides to bring up the piece of information that Shota did not tell his class yet. Ms. Joke says to Shota that while the format changes every year, one tradition remains the same in every Provisional Hero License Exam: The "Crushing of U.A.". While contemplating how his students defend themselves with great efficiency from the attacks of students from other schools, Shota tells Emi that it didn’t matter if he told them or not about the tradition of taking out U.A. because it wouldn't change the fact that they'd have to overcome obstacles like true heroes must do every day. He also says that Pro Heroes Quirks are also widely known and apologizes that his students are more advanced than hers.
  </p>
  <p key="9010901e-bc55-4132-8ebd-bdcb770c6edf">
   As the first exam progresses, and the number of participants remaining to pass it is announced. Shota says it's frustrating he can't tell who pass and fails the exam. Ms. Joke wonders why he is worried. Shota explains that he is not worried but has high expectations because two of his students (Izuku and Katsuki) have a big effect on the rest of the class. They aren't leaders or the most popular, but Izuku and Katsuki's passion inspire everyone in the class and raises the standard for success. As a result of their presence, Shota feels that Class 1-A should perform spectacularly which is why he has high expectations.
  </p>
  <p key="45151031-b903-4241-9646-376531df97e5">
   Shota continues to observe the performance of his students from the stands until the Provisional Hero License Exam finally ends. Everyone in Class 1-A, except for Katsuki Bakugo and Shoto Todoroki, have managed to pass and obtain their provisional licenses. After this, everyone returns to U.A.

   Later that night, while preparing tomorrow's classes, one of the security robots reports him about a fight between Izuku and Katsuki in

  </p>
  <p key="6b8deb40-a583-43fe-b9b4-72b19cccae2b">
   After their fight, Shota restrains Izuku and Katsuki while scolding them for having a fight on school grounds. Shota wants to punish them severely for breaking the rules, but Toshinori steps in and tells him the reason for the fight was brought about due to Katsuki feeling guilty about his retirement. Although Shota understands the reasons, he considers that they still deserve an appropriate punishment for their transgression.
  </p>
  <p key="4927aedb-270d-4721-81d7-62a788114a29">
   Shota punishes them by placing them under house arrest; Izuku three days and Katsuki four days. During their house arrest, Shota states that they will be cleaning the dormitory common spaces day and night and they must write a written statement of regret. Shota tells them that if their injuries do not heal they must go to the infirmary and they must not dare think about relying on Chiyo Shuzenji. Having criticized them enough, Shota tells them to go to bed.

   In the classroom, Shota tells his class that starting from today they will resume normal class activities. Shota warns them that the training will be tougher than last semester. Tsuyu asks him to tell the class more about the Hero Work-Studies. Shota obliges, describing it as hero activities done off-campus, closer to the real thing than the Workplace Training after the Sports Festival. Ochaco expresses frustration at needing to work so hard to be scouted after the Sports Festival if they were to do internships anyway.
  </p>
  <p key="9c05ddd6-cd10-44e6-b985-97966466f7d6">
   Shota explains that the Hero Work-Studies are an opportunity to make use of the connections they garnered at the Sports Festival. The Hero Work-Studies are managed at the discretion of students themselves nowadays because in the past each office would conduct their own recruiting efforts which would cause them to fight over U.A. students. Since most of them have Provisional Hero Licenses, Class 1-A can now participate in formal, longer-term activities. Shota tells Class 1-A that they will be expected to write about their experiences but he will explain it at a time later.

   Shota sees that U.A's Big 3 lacks rationality. Mirio Togata tells him not to worry as he is the star performer today. Mirio steps in and tries to break the ice with a joke but no one in Class 1-A understands his joke. Mirio insists that the best way for the first year students to learn about work studies is to fight him, much to Class 1-A's surprise. Shota tells Mirio to do as he pleases.

Shota tells Class 1-A to take this great opportunity and learn from it because as he knows it, Mirio Togata is the closest man to becoming the Number One Hero which includes the pro heroes as well, which shocks the rest of Class 1-A.

  <p key="b0213a80-d0f8-494b-85e0-9af55982ea1e">
   Shoto is astonished and surprised at the level of great strength Mirio Togata has displayed. Shota Aizawa asks Shoto why he's not fighting and the student replies it's because he didn't earn a Provisional Hero License and feels that he doesn't have the right to engage Mirio in combat. Meanwhile, the fight continues. The remaining half of the students try to fight back, after Deku could discern how his Quirk works, but still, Mirio defeats them all without any problem.

   While Class 1-A recovers, Mirio states that the reason he wanted to fight Class 1-A is to show the experience he gained from the Hero-Work Studies; Mirio was able to transform his Quirk and reach the top. Mirio encourages the first years to participate at Hero-Work Studies, even if they're scared so that they can grow stronger. Class 1-A begins to see that Hero Work-Studies are different from the Field Training they went through.

Thanks to the information all the Heroes provided him with, Sir Nighteye was able to make substantial progress with his investigation.

Shota explains that his Erasure momentarily halts the activation of the Quirk Factor which allows him to cancel other people's Quirks; his Erasure cannot damage the Quirk Factor. Fat Gum follows up by explaining that, thanks to Eijiro's brave actions by protecting Tamaki, they were able to obtain another bullet with the contents still inside. Fat Gum explains that after examining the contents of the bullet, they discovered that inside the bullet were human blood and cells, which disturbs the U.A. students.

   When Kaminari and several other Class 1-A students protest Vlad’s biased commentary during the start of the fourth battle, Shota tells them to stop, reminding them that their losses would be serious in the real world and that the Class 1-B students have had better tactics.
   After Class 1-A’s victory in the fourth battle, Shota complimented his students on their teamwork, then rejoined Toshinori, Midnight, and Vlad to watch the final battle.

   Once the crisis is averted, Shota asks that the battle be allowed to continue, despite Vlad’s protests, as the students still want to fight. While watching the fight between Izuku and Hitoshi, Shota remembers his time training Hitoshi to use the Capturing Weapon.
   Shota expresses confusion when Izuku uses Blackwhip properly for the first time and comments when it disappears.

   After the end of the battle, Hitoshi once again laments his performance and asks if this was his “exam”, to which Shota avoids the question and announces the assessments. He asks Izuku about his outburst during the battle and compliments Uraraka’s growth. When Hitoshi continues to berate himself, Shota briefly chokes him with his weapon and reminds him that the other students went through a lot of training to achieve their skills, telling him to focus on improving himself.
   Shota announces that Hitoshi has passed his test. He then asks Monoma to visit Eri the next day.

Neito apologizes for not being able to help more, but Shota thanks him for trying.

   Once in prison, Shota and Hizashi are received by Naomasa and Gran Torino, who reminds them that Nomu are created by modifying human bodies but their hearts and brains are all twisted so they are not considered living beings but mere puppets, at least that’s what they initially believed, Gran Torino adds. Shota tells Gran Torino to get to the point to which Naomasa tells him that saying this is necessary to prepare themselves mentally.

   The four enter Kurogiri's cell. The old hero and detective explain that they interrogated Kurogiri several times but never obtain any relevant information about the League of Villains. However, upon studying him they discovered relevant data: Kurogiri's Quirk is in fact a culmination of multiple Quirk factors combined into something new; and the root factor bears a striking resemblance to a Quirk used by an old friend of the two Pro Heroes. with this they concluded that Kurogiri is a nomu created with the corpse of Shota and Hizashi friend Oboro Shirakumo.

   Naomasa and Gran Torino explain that they have failed trying to obtain information from Kurogiri, but they hope that due to their friendship with Oboro, both Hizashi and Shota can awaken the consciousness of their former friend from Kurogiri. Shota says that if they think they can save him through their 'bonds' they're getting their hopes up. Gran Torino replies that with a strong enough basis, miracles can be possible. Hizashi questions if it shouldn't be the Oboro's family who does that to which Naomasa says they will contact them if he and Shota fails. Shota says he'll be damned to let Oboro's parents learn of this stuff.

   Shota starts talking to Kurogiri about moments when he was Oboro like when they met for the first time, when he picked up a stray kitten that Shota left behind, or when he lent his goggles to protect his eyes.

Shota yells that he wants people like Oboro to become heroes who can pull other people along and live long lives. He shows his goggles to Kurogiri and yells to him, with tears in his eyes, that if Oboro is still in there, then they should strive to be heroes together again.

Oboro says "hospital" before the fog hides his face again and Kurogiri falls unconscious. Naomasa congratulates both heroes for their help. Hizashi cares about Shota since having used his Erasure for so long must have affected his eyes. Shota tells him that it doesn't matter, that they are just dried out, while he cries.

   Quirk, Present Mic shatters Tomura's capsule completely before Dr. Garaki can wake him up, shortly after punching the doctor himself in retaliation for the damage he has done, especially to his friends. The reinforcements finally arrive and overwhelm the High-Ends, declaring that they finally win.

   The laboratory begins to crumble, and the heroes try to run away as fast as they can from the destruction. Ryukyu yells to Shota to grab on to her, as she was carrying several Heroes on her back. Just as Shota launched his Capturing Weapon to latch on, a High-End grabs him by the leg as it disintegrates. Crust uses one of his
   Shoot Shield
   to cut the Nomu's hand to save him, but he's caught by the decaying wave. Shota can only watch in horror as Crust crumbles to dust, smiling and giving a thumbs up. Thanks to his sacrifice, Shota is one of the few heroes who manage to escape from the hospital before it ends completely destroyed.

  <p key="c45d5360-44b2-47b6-a58f-671a036dc078">
   The wave of decay is extinguished shortly after reaching the nearby city, where citizens are being evacuated by students, Deku being one of them. Endeavor, who had also escaped destruction, begins to attack Tomura, but Tomura is hardly interested in him. Endeavor radios Burnin to inform her that he is fighting Tomura, and for some reason the villain is heading to the city in search of something called "One For All".
  </p>
  <p key="a4cbb2fd-6c8d-4acb-b36b-fbaeeebcf1a1">
   Izuku overhears the conversation, and quickly realizes that Tomura has not only sensed him but plans on coming towards him, Izuku is quick to leave the city in order to protect his friends and the civilians, being followed by Katsuki. Izuku then uses the private channel to explain to Endeavor and everyone who is listening that he is Tomura's target.
  </p>
  <p key="d4e8338e-3a49-40f8-9455-befe71814f65">
   Tomura catches up to Izuku and Katsuki, and before they can fight Gran Torino appears and takes the boys away, while Ryukyu attacks Tomura. Shota emerges from the dust cloud to cancel Tomura's Quirk, allowing Ryukyu to knock Tomura into the air.
  </p>
  <p key="163b2e07-9305-4824-ba32-61ee59ddb19e">
   Shota asks himself why Deku and Katsuki are there, wondering if Tomura is after them. Thinking back to Crust and his friend Oboro Shirakumo, Shota understands that they had sacrificed their lives so that he can be there to face Tomura. He says out loud to Tomura that he won't allow him to lay a rotten finger on his students. Tomura simply replies with how cool he is.
  </p>
  <p key="4680b5fe-6bb1-4054-834f-76a224f3aaaa">
   Due to the Nomu that grabbed ahold of him, Shota's leg is busted, so he's supported by

   , with the latter also controlling the water around his eyes to help him from blinking. Despite Shota erasing Tomura's Quirks, it turns out his body has been remodeled, providing him with near All Might-level strength, just like the Nomus, allowing him to still easily go toe-to-toe with Endeavor and Ryukyu in battle.
  </p>
  <p key="f34a30cd-7da0-442d-9091-bf9aeafa25bd">
   Things get more complicated when Tomura unleashes the surviving Nomus, known as the Near High-Ends, which distract most of the remaining Pro Heroes, while Tomura uses the opportunity to get rid of Shota himself. He thinks to himself how he can't die, because without him there'll be no one left to hold Tomura back, and that there's still so much he has to teach his students, thinking about Izuku, Katsuki, and everyone else in Class 1-A, plus Hitoshi. As he grabs his knife preparing to fight, he's surprised by the sudden reappearance of Izuku and Katsuki, halting Tomura.
  </p>
  <p key="9629dab2-5831-48a9-a07b-e0c67e055a8e">
   Izuku says that with Tomura's Quirks erased, they can join the fight without worry of getting their Quirks stolen, especially with the rest of the Pros busy with the Near High-Ends, and that losing their teacher is the worst-case scenario, that it's their turn to help save the teacher that has watched over them for so long; Shota is shocked and touched by this declaration. Endeavor, Gran Torino, Izuku, and Katsuki continue their assault on Tomura while protecting Shota.
  </p>
  <p key="d98f5e29-766a-4471-b769-9f753f83c093">
   Despite all the beatings, Tomura still manages to remain conscious and fighting back, with Shota barely able to keep his eyes open and focused, while Rock Lock and Manual try to find some cover for him. Tomura manages to get a fatal punch right into Gran Torino's chest, shocking everyone, before he once again jumps away heading right for Shota. Ryukyu tries to halt him with her dragon hand, but he punches a hole right through it anyway. An enraged Izuku shows up, completely binding him with Blackwhip to keep him steady, while Endeavor prepares to attack, but unbeknownst to everyone, Tomura has in his possession two Quirk-erasing bullets, one of which pointed directly at Shota.
  </p>
  <p key="adf556ea-94fc-4da4-9e86-2d0fd37c8233">
   Ryukyu notices the one in his hand warning the others about it, with Izuku attempting to stop him with a Smash, but while one is destroyed by Katsuki, the other Tomura successfully shoots through the hole in Ryukyu's hand, directly hitting Shota in the leg. However, thanks to Ryukyu's warning, and thinking about Eri, Shota is able to quickly and rationally use his knife to slice his leg off to prevent the rest of the drug from spreading. The completely disfigured Tomura can only respond that Shota "really is pretty cool."
  </p>
  <p key="7bd9455b-9480-47f2-8541-d909192bc6b7">
   Despite this, Tomura manages to use a shock wave to propel him forward away from everyone, grabbing hold of Shota's face ready to crush it. Just then, he is saved by Shoto Todoroki, using his ice to halt him in place, while Izuku provides Tomura with a punch to the gut before going to make sure Shota is alright. However, Shota finally succumbs to the pain, closing his eyes as he's knocked unconscious, with Tomura slowly starting to regenerate as all his Quirks return to him.
  </p>
  <p key="ebdbf420-9c0e-4221-b3a9-029c382a11e0">
   Rock Lock and Manual tend to Shota's wounds using his binding cloth, with the former telling Izuku to run now that Erasure is no longer in effect, but an even more enraged Izuku refuses to stand down. Izuku then realizes that Tomura's body is incomplete and can't handle the full power of All For One, so before he can execute another Decay shockwave toward everyone, Izuku leaps into the air, utilizing Blackwhip and his newly unlocked Float to bring everyone with him away from the destruction.
   He returns the rest back to the ground while Izuku keeps Tomura in the air to prevent him from using Decay again. Shoto goes to assist in helping Shota and Gran Torino with first aid.

  <p key="0601cb75-ba92-49da-ac93-3c00e08d9bec">
   Katsuki, Shoto, and Endeavor soon head back up into the air to finish the battle for good, telling Rock Lock to take care of Shota and the others.
   The plan fails, with Tomura continuing to fight back thanks to some assistance from All For One himself. Tenya Iida and Nejire Hado show up to join the fight, helping Rock Lock and Manual escort the critically injured Shota, Gran Torino, and Ryukyu, off the battlefield,
   who are taken in and treated for their injuries.

   Alongside most of the other critically injured participants in the war, he is taken to
   Central Hospital
   to be treated. After a couple of days, he has regained consciousness, alongside a visiting Present Mic, with his right eye bandaged up alongside his cut off right leg. The doctor tells him that he and the others would've ended up much worse if it wasn't for those who prioritized their safety. During this recovery period, the two learn that one of the fatalities during the war was Midnight, with Present Mic mourning over her, and Shota asking how everyone else is doing.
   In the aftermath of all the events, with the cities erupting into chaos and after many Pro Heroes have retired, Shota is one of them with the resolve to continue fighting.

   About one month after the war ended, Shota spent most of his time still recovering at Central Hospital. During this time, his students were out looking for Izuku who left U.A. High after disclosing the secret of One For All to protect them. After Class 1-A recovers Izuku and brings him back to U.A., they were confronted by angry protesting civilians demanding for Izuku to leave. Ochaco proceeds to give a speech to the crowd pleading to let them help Izuku, which he hears from a tablet in his room, proud of his student's growth.

   Nezu communicates to Shota, who was broadcasting the incident to him, telling him his class managed to do well, to Shota’s delight. Nezu asks about the status of Kurogiri, which he states that they've had no success in getting through to him yet, with Nezu reminding that without Oboro regaining consciousness they would never have gotten as far as they have, meaning there is still hope.

   Shota asks about the countermeasures regarding Himiko Toga, with Nezu saying that since they've figured out how much blood she can absorb and how long her transformation lasts, they only let in the evacuees after a certain amount of time to be sure.

   During his time of recovery, Shota learns about the "U.A Traitor" as being one of his students from Class 1-A:
   <a href="Yuga Aoyama.html" key="5a6d266b-13b5-43a3-8acc-5b34b764bdb0" title="Yuga Aoyama">
    Yuga Aoyama

   . Having to learn of his class being devastated by Yuga's downfall, he was watching from a tablet held by Present Mic, listening to Izuku pleading with Yuga. He appears on screen before the class and asks Izuku if he has a plan, which Izuku does not. Shota addresses Naomasa that he will take full responsibility for not recognizing Yuga's pain and siding with the rest of the class, informing Yuga he has no intention of expelling him from U.A.
  </p>
  <p key="f8eb427a-a037-4ef2-b5fc-5c4991c48e03">
   Shota reveals that he has an idea, and after the Aoyama Family's ears have been covered, he informs Class 1-A, the U.A. Staff, and the Police Force of his plan. After the discussion, Nezu states that it seems possible, while Naomasa has the Aoyama Family escorted back to their HQ, telling everyone not to say a word to anyone else about the plan.
  </p>
  <p key="9ed2ba5e-37ee-48ee-a6c5-407d04ddf9a6">
   Yuga is taken to Central Hospital, where he is interrogated by Shota. The doctor accompanying him states they found no irregularities with his brain waves or bodily functions. Shota figures that

   ’s fate was the result of something All For One obtained after his defeat by All Might. He also realizes that if he really planted an explosive in Yuga, there would be no need for the public display of threats to his family in case of betrayal. All that All For One planted was a seed of fear in them.
  </p>
  <p key="dbb0808a-035e-494c-a8a7-c3edbca26470">
   After telling Yuga he’s lucky to have friends who stood up for him like that, Shota asks if he’s afraid of All For One. Yuga responds yes, as well as fearing that the more his classmates believe in him, the more he’ll lose faith in himself, and that even if he took their hand, if All For One appeared before him, he's worried he’d make the same bad choice all over again. His fear causes him to not want to do anything anymore, and just die somewhere alone. Shota continues that even given leniency, his sins will always be with him, and when the war is over, he may not return to U.A. However, he declares to Yuga that he will fight, because it’s the only thing he can do.
  </p>
  <p key="4d4baf2f-7902-4265-a6a8-1e844d7f0063">
   Yuga understands that, realizing he must become another pawn for victory. Shota tell him they are no different from All For One, using him for their own interests, but he will not let him be tormented by his sins forever, and as long as he’s in charge of the Hero course, he’ll take care of all his students. He tells Yuga he doesn’t teach his students to live a life burdened by guilt, and even if he feels ashamed, he must walk along with those who lend a hand to him, at the same time thinking about Kurogiri.

   Shota tells him that they will protect him and as long as he’s with them, he’ll be okay. Yuga then asks what someone like him could accomplish, as Shota clarifies that they won’t be sending him in on his own, and that it’s a path they’ll all walk together.

   With Tomura's completion approaching, Shota's plan begins to take into effect. Knowing that All For One is keeping tabs on the Heroes through Search, he needed Yuga and the Aoyama Family to play their roles as infiltrators and spies for All For One. He and All Might recruited Shota's protégée, Hitoshi Shinso, to take advantage of Hitoshi's newest development of being able to make brainwashed people speak, by having him brainwash the Aoyamas so that they can deceive him without detecting a single lie.
  </p>
  <p key="b2f9fdec-14e9-4c6e-b00b-b4396c7ff41f">
   The next step of the plan is to make use of Kurogiri's Warp Gate to allow them to warp themselves into the fight, to catch All For One off guard, as well as warp the villains to locations all over Japan, separating them. At Kurogiri’s cell in Central Hospital, Shota and Vlad King inform Neito Monoma of the special request from All Might, asking if he can handle it. Neito asks if they’re serious about him being able to copy and master the Warp Gate Quirk in a few days, with Shota apologizing that they’ve been unable to reach him, unsure if he is Kurogiri or Oboro Shirakumo currently. He also adds that his Erasure is all but useless with just one eye, meaning he’ll be sidelined in the battle. Neito reflects on how he heard that during the Jaku City incident, it would’ve been a complete massacre if it wasn’t for Shota.
  </p>
  <p key="f221f30a-b699-451b-8a07-23c943d6b871">
   Neito was able to successfully copy and train himself using Warp Gate, and the heroes waited patiently for Izuku to make contact with Yuga, who was released from custody with his "lawyers". Once Yuga meets Izuku in a desolated location, All For One has finally re-emerged, and with his prize in his reach, All For One summons an army of villains to overwhelm Izuku and finally steal One For All. However, Neito uses Warp Gate to teleport the remnants of the heroes to confront the villains.
  </p>
  <p key="695ef255-beb0-4be0-ad37-33240f9b5209">
   Shota was teleported outside of the U.A. Flying Sky Fortress, designed to defeat Tomura who is soon teleported to the exact location. To compensate the near-loss of his Erasure Quirk, Shota has Neito also copy his Quirk and then use it on Tomura to erase his usage of Quirks, accompanied by Manual moisturizing Neito's eyes to keep him from blinking.
  </p>
  <p key="b2b52181-988b-4bfb-be30-f2de6762b6c5">
   Shota believes that he can help work around the 5 minute copy limitation by staying right beside Neito, however, their plan is ultimately failing when Izuku doesn't show up, due to being pulled into another Warp Gate at the last moment, followed by Tomura’s left hand suddenly transforming into a monstrous blob of fingers.
   Everyone soon realizes the the grotesque swarm of fingers is simply “growth” from the body, just as is the case with his hair or nails, making his body trying to adapt to his ever-evolving Quirks, the form leading to the next step of their superhuman society: Doctor

   . Shota fears that Tomura is completely different than the one he fought against in Jaku City. Neito starts to worry, having done everything Shota taught him, while Mandalay informs him they’ve gotten into contact with Izuku.
  </p>
  <p key="098d5331-66c1-4bc6-8fc9-cdad005b5bbf">
   Somehow, Izuku was teleported to
   Okuto Island
   after Himiko snagged him, asking to warp him. The Heroes all figure that they cannot warp Izuku because Neito can't use multiple Quirks at the same time, so activating Warp Gate again would require at least ten seconds without Erasure. They also realize that the moment Erasure is undone, Tomura will be able to use Decay through each of his endlessly growing wave of fingers, finishing them all. With their plan in jeopardy, Shota tells Izuku he is on his own make it back to the mainland and to the U.A. Flying Sky Fortress, while they continue to face down Tomura.
