   Whether the target is organic or not, Decay will work without fail. As such, this Quirk is extremely lethal against living beings, having their flesh rot away if hit by it. The speed of the disintegration has developed from slow to almost immediate, eventually spreading through their whole body if a victim doesn't amputate the decaying body part (

   It is also possible for the effect of Decay to spread beyond what the user has touched, creating a domino chain of disintegrated victims.
   Tomura has had this ability ever since Decay first manifested on him, being strong enough to destroy an entire household, but due to his jumbled up memories of the event, he seemingly forgot about or mentally repressed this specific ability until halfway through the

   As Tomura's memories of killing his own family were repressed by his subconscious, he became unaware of some aspects of his Quirk, unconsciously holding himself back from causing more destruction than he was actually capable of. As his past started sorting itself through his mind due to damage caused to his family's hands, Tomura started relearning and showcasing how truly powerful Decay is while battling against the Meta Liberation Army.

   Decay is Tomura's main method of combat. By nature, this Quirk forces Tomura to always engage his opponent in close quarters, though he often requires only to make contact with his enemy in order to kill or heavily injure them. Tomura seems to have improved his Quirk ever since its first appearance at the

   Tomura is often careful with his hands when touching objects he doesn't want to destroy, letting at least one of his fingers free from use while holding things.
   He employs a similar method when holding people hostage, threatening to disintegrate them if they don't comply or cooperate with him. If Tomura gets angered or frustrated, he is likely to drop his carefulness.
