   The troubled children from Masegaki have powerful Quirks and their counseling hasn't had enough of an effect on them to change their personalities. Shoto recognizes that their teacher really need the students to help save her student's young hearts. Katsuki thinks the best way to corral the children would be to assert dominance over their leader. One of the calmer students calls out Katsuki for his bad attitude and apparently poor upbringing.

  <p key="eae4e3f1-7de6-459a-bc27-ec989adf3698">
   Inasa believes the best way to save the children is to get along with them. He takes two children into his arms and asks them if they want to be heroes. Inasa goes on to tell them that heroes shouldn't make trouble for their teacher but the kids expose that Inasa failed the exam and created more work for everyone since they had to hold this training course. Surprised, Inasa apologizes and his plan ultimately fails.

   Camie points out that the kids are a bit more twisted than expected. Katsuki thinks physically disciplining them is the best course of action but Shoto completely disagrees. Katsuki was brought up in that manner but Shoto was abused during his upbringing. Shoto steps up and tries to talk with the kids but once again they find him boring.

   Camie suggests that they introduce themselves using their Quirks. Katsuki adds that its best to intimidate the kids into submission. The troubled brats notice the four students talking and decide to attack using their own powerful Quirks. Katsuki is excited by the prospect, the four students activate their Quirks and accept the young children's challenge.
  </p>
  <p key="f39b84af-cdab-4c8a-ab9b-566a87ae770a">
   The young leader of the brats believes that the teenagers looking down on the kids will never resonate with them. Seiji chimes in and adds that retaliation is inappropriate for the situation.
   The Masegaki children are products of the Quirk Singularity; a theory that states Quirks are getting stronger by the generation and soon they will be uncontrollable.

   The children attack with
   Binging Ball
   ,
   Assault Dust
   ,
   Tongue Tank
   ,
   Queen Beam
   , and many more Quirks. The trainees with Gang Orca notice the other students in trouble. Gang Orca reminds them that real Heroes would overcome this situation. The four heroes in training emerge from the assault unscathed, having protected themselves with their own powerful Quirks.
  </p>
  <p key="222f2532-f8ef-4692-b522-bc61f0f7e51d">
   Katsuki is irritated the kids would attack unprovoked. Shoto adds the kids have no consideration for their elders. Inasa is simply worried about getting along better with the children. The brat's leader tries to get the kids to attack again, but Camie distracts a little girl with an illusion of Shoto. The child worries about his generation being better than the adults who look down on them.

  <p key="9ab44f36-26be-4ddc-9c87-f57d426325b5">
   Suddenly, Inasa lifts a few kids into the air and Shoto adds his frozen touch to create a beautiful playground of all the children to enjoy. The kids are surprised the teenager's Quirks can produce something amazing. Shoto gives credit to the children's splendid Quirks for being the base of the playground. He lines the remaining kids up to participate while Seiji and Present Mic comment on the accomplishment.
  </p>
  <p key="7d345fb1-0075-4dcf-89b2-cf17ec14f0bb">
   Katsuki forces the brat's leader to join in on the fun. The child resists at first, but Katsuki surprises him with advice not to look down on others. These words came from Katsuki's heart, so they resonate with the young boy.
   Komari Ikoma
   is surprised to see her students having fun without being chaotic. Present Mic reminds her that it's her job to guide the kids from now on. All Might and Endeavor watch as Shoto warms up one of the young girls with his fire. All Might comments that Quirks exist to help and inspire others.

   Katsuki uses his explosions to destroy the playground and Inasa gets all the kids to help clean up. Shoto tells one kid that his Binging Balls will help in disaster efforts as they're being used to clean up the ice as well. Komari is still shocked that the kids are acting docile. Gang Orca argues that the kids have always been docile and they just reflect how they feel about adults. The teacher resolves to do her best to guide the children from now on.

  <p key="730ee98f-8c50-4190-b0ef-7a8bfef49344">
   Katsuki gets his equipment back and the students say goodbye to the Precious Brats.
   Gang Orca commends everyone for cooperating to pass the trial. He tries to address the brats, but they've already moved along after getting bored.

   The triumphant young heroes exit the facility and find Seiji and his teacher talking with All Might and Present Mic. Camie interrupts them, upsetting Seiji as he explains communications are being opened between U.A. and Shiketsu to deal with the

   Shoto encounters his father. Endeavor surprises his son by admitting he's proud of him. He even states he'll become a man Shoto can be proud of. Inasa notices this softer side of Endeavor, punches himself in the face, and approaches him. He extends his hand and tells Endeavor that he'll be cheering for the new No. 1 Hero. Endeavor accepts his hand and Inasa lets go of his grudge against the Todoroki family.

   Despite looking back on their path once and a while, the young heroes and Endeavor are making progress step by step.
