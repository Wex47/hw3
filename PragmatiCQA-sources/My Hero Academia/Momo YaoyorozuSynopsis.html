She is visibly nervous for their bout since Fumikage's Quirk allows him to effectively attack and defend. She ponders over a strategy to defend herself by creating a shield, but she's interrupted when the battle suddenly starts.

Momo creates a metal staff and prepares to counterattack until Midnight points out that she's pushed out of bounds. Fumikage is named the victor in the quickly ended bout, greatly disappointing Momo.

   One week prior to final exams, Denki and Mina discuss how worried they are for the written portion. Momo placed first in the midterms and she says she's more than willing to help them study. Unlike them, she's much more worried about the practical portion. Kyoka, Hanta, and Mashirao ask for her help as well. Momo blushes with great pride and excitement. She gracefully says she's excited to help them and will hold a study session over the weekend at her residence. She begins monologuing about how she'll have her mother set up the great hall with tea for the study session. Her peers notice her accidental bragging, but they don't care because they know that she's so excited and bouncy that she doesn't even know she's bragging about her wealth.

   They all eventually meet up at the Yaoyorozu's giant, fancy estate, where Momo helps them study. Thanks to her guidance, Denki and Mina feel they do well on the three days of written tests. The day of the practical arrives following the three days of written tests and Class 1-A meets up with many of the teachers at the central plaza of the exam arena.

  <p key="cb04d4a3-5bd5-4aa2-ae3e-b56ecd2a2b7f">
   The students believe they'll be fighting villain bots for the finals, so Kyoka asks Momo why so many teachers need to be present. Shota and

   reveal that this actually won't be the case. Momo is surprised that the teachers are changing the format for the first time. Nezu explains that in order to better prepare the students for real-life encounters with villains, they will be paired off and matched up against one of the teachers. Momo and Shoto are paired up against Shota.
  </p>
  <p key="026e9bb1-1fc2-4380-b43a-8f3a179dd2a9">
   A few days before the practical, the teachers met to discuss the change. Shota mentions that he will face Momo and Shoto to exploit their weakness since they both rely too heavily on their powerful Quirks. Back at the central plaza, all of the matchups are revealed in order. Momo and Shoto are set to face their homeroom teacher in the fourth practical battle. They will be allotted thirty minutes to either capture him or escape the battle stage through an escape gate. All teachers will wear compressed weights to give the students a handicap.

   manage to defeat Ectoplasm in the second battle. Momo says to herself that she's not surprised, and has a flashback of her embarrassing defeat at the hands of Fumikage before exiting the room.
   She meets up with Shoto in a replica city just before their exam begins. Shoto catches her daydreaming and asks if she's nervous. He admits he doesn't blame her since they're up against Shota and says not to worry because he has a plan for them to win.
  </p>
  <p key="129d5ad3-af06-43c2-bf9f-4643374a1a23">
   Their practical battle begins as they run through the fake city. Shoto explains his plan is for Momo to create small objects so once she's unable to keep producing them they will know Shota is close by. Shoto plans to draw him in so Momo can run through the escape gate, and tells her to stay close to him until then. Momo reluctantly goes along with it since she's lost confidence in her own ability to make decisions.
  </p>
  <p key="0a8499ea-a8cd-403d-84ff-73a1f165584c">
   She begins making matryoshka dolls and praises Shoto for his quick thinking, telling him that although they were both let in on recommendations, Shoto's shown more practical skills for being a Pro-Hero. She admits that she only followed his orders in the Cavalry battle and that she was swiftly exposed as a weakling when it was her turn to fight. Shoto interrupts when he notices Momo's stopped producing the dolls. She apologizes, but it's too late as Shota has already found them both.
  </p>
  <p key="eff8a89f-30ae-41eb-96f7-b6e5633de8e0">
   Momo runs away on Shoto's command, starting to panic and several indecisive thoughts run through her head. Her lack of confidence is even evident to Shota himself, who quickly catches up to her. He uses his capturing weapon to grab her arm, but she notices her Quirk isn't erased and uses it to free herself. She runs in the opposite direction back towards Shoto. She finds him hanging from a light post, restrained by Shota's capturing weapon. She apologizes but Shoto warns her that Shota is fast approaching.
  </p>
  <p key="786515eb-c639-4a92-a855-403059eddfd0">
   She begins to panic again, unable to decide whether to run or save Shoto. He asks her if she has a plan and apologizes for not asking her beforehand. Momo says it won't work since his plan failed earlier. Shoto encourages her to trust her instincts because he believes she's better at leading their team than he is. He even admits that he voted for her to be Class President because he felt she would be best at leading the class. Shoto's encouragement helps Momo believe in herself and she realizes how disgraceful she's been acting.
  </p>
  <p key="62fe4510-9e22-49e6-9b2e-8a3deaccfaf0">
   Shota eventually reaches them and asks if Momo's given up. She responds that she hasn't and warns Shoto to close his eyes. She throws the dolls at Shota and he hits them, triggering the flash bombs inside them. Momo uses the opening to free Shoto from his restraints and announces that she does have a plan to take advantage of Shota's weakness.
   They both run away from Shota as Momo explains that his Quirk has been unstable since his injuries fighting Nomu.

  <p key="31a8091f-53c6-4f84-b492-0dd4a9a28124">
   They rush down a street as Shota attacks them again with his capturing weapon. Momo mentions that passing the exam is all a matter of timing. Shoto questions how timing is relevant if Shota can take away their Quirks at any given time. Momo thinks to herself that Shoto's wrong to believe that Shota can keep their powers erased. Just as Momo expects, Shoto's Quirk returns to him in time for him to use his

   Momo creates a weapon similar to Shota's using her Quirk and explains her full plan to Shoto. He agrees with her and they go through with it together. They run from behind the ice wall wearing cloaks. Shota attacks them, but the upper halves are only mannequins and a catapult was hidden under the cloak as well. Momo tries to trigger it and shoot the cloth at Shota, but she misses. Shota backs off anyway, giving her a chance to trigger it. She orders Shoto to blast his flames and explains that the weapon is made of nitinol alloy and when it's heated it returns to its original shape instantly. This traps Shota in an instant, allowing Momo and Shoto to handcuff him and pass the exam.
  </p>
  <p key="38ecafe4-353a-451b-928b-1602d9e00ae5">
   Shoto mentions that her plan went a bit too smoothly. Momo replies that she messed up by missing the initial trigger, and believes that Shota may have let them win. Shota explains that he was simply distancing himself from Shoto since he was still covered with a cloth, and this is what lead him directly into her trap. Shoto realizes it was a matter of timing all along and thanks Momo. She's overwhelmed with emotion and begins to cry. Shoto asks what's wrong, but she tells him it's nothing. He tells her there's a pressure point on her foot if she's feeling nauseous, and she tearfully tells him again that it's nothing.

   Momo watches the remaining exams from the monitoring room. During Denki and Mina's battle with Nezu, Momo deduces that the principal is predicting his opponent's moves and planning his attacks through specific calculations using his Quirk. Momo, Tenya, Izuku, and Tsuyu are shocked when his sadistic attitude comes out during the match. Ochaco enters the room and is shocked to find that Mina and Denki fail the exam, which Momo confirms to her.

   Putting Saiko's plan into action, her classmates trap the four in a room, closing it completely and sealing off Mezo and Kyoka's Quirks that are good for detecting people. Momo realizes that she and the others are dealing with highly intelligent opponents who have been able to correctly predict all of their moves thus far. Then, they incapacitate Tsuyu by cooling the hallway down excessively using the air conditioning system, causing her to start hibernating due her Frog Quirk.

Momo predicts that their opponents are behind that door and that it would be dangerous for them to try to break through. Momo considers what she can do to help with the cold air, and decides she could

  <p key="4fb84a88-848d-40b6-9c54-afd438e37bb1">
   Momo comes up with a plan. After reading her book, she creates four headphones and a large amp. Saiko readies her allies to storm the room but is surprised when her rival students counter with a high-frequency sonic wave attack, knocked out all of the Seiai students except Saiko. Class 1-A students leave the room to find Momo's plan was successful.

   Saiko, hiding behind the door, grabs Momo back into the hallway and locks the doors behind her. With Momo weakened due to the strain caused by an extended usage of her Quirk, Saiko attempts to use her balls on Momo's targets. Momo creates a pair of handcuffs to restrain one of Saiko's arms, and as Saiko attacks with her other arm, Momo's friends break through the door and Tsuyu restrains Saiko's other arm with her tongue. After questioning why Momo's friends would return to help her when she surely would have been defeated, Saiko admits defeat.

   Momo is in charge of leading a group of her classmates, planning the rescue operations.

   Before the round started, Itsuka confronts Momo and asks her about the beauty pageant. Momo replies she didn't know about it plus she had band practice. Itsuka claims that ever since their internship together her and Momo always get treated like a pair. Toru says that some fans during Class 1-A's performance kept yelling out "Yaoyorozu and Kendo". Itsuka doesn't like being lumped in with Momo because she feels her rival has a better Quirk and better grades. Itsuka has always wanted the chance to fight Momo head to head. Momo accepts her friend's challenge.

   As the second round begins, Momo takes the initiative and leads her team.

Shihai exits Dark Shadow and evades two nets created by Momo by merging with the shadows between the pipes.

   Shihai sneakily takes Yuga away after diverting his rivals attention, but Fumikage with Black Fallen Angel soars past Shihai and rescues Yuga from him. Momo advises her teammates as to how they should deal with Shihai. She tells Yuga to use his
   Navel Buffet☆Laser
   while Fumikage flies them around. This warps the shape of the shadows and takes away all Shihai's hiding spots.
  </p>
  <p key="63dda888-19b2-499c-9302-beaa8b1927dd">
   After foiling the 1-B teams' initial plan, Momo declares that even the most unexpected circumstances are within her expectations. Right as she says that however, a mushroom sprouts on her nose. Kinoko uses her Quirk to cover everything in

   With Kinoko's part of the plan now in action, Momo yells out to her 1-A team to keep calm and regroup but Manga quickly uses his Quirk, and a large, wall-like string of Katakana suddenly appears, cutting Momo off from the rest of her team. Itsuka planned on isolating Momo to cut the brain off of her team. With Momo separated from her team, Itsuka attacks her with an enlarged palm thrust. Momo tries to block it with a dense shield but she's knocked back by Itsuka's

   Itsuka barrages Momo enlarged fists of fury.

   Momo believes that she isn't superior to Itsuka, but refuses to submit and resolves to earn the respect she's been given.
   Remembering Itsuka’s compliments and lamentations, Momo finds new resolve to win the fight. Momo creates a cannon mid-fight, much to Itsuka's surprise, and fires the cannon over the wall. However, Itsuka lands a powerful hit with her
   Double Jumbo Fist
   . After this, Momo creates a rope.

   Dark Shadow grabs Toru and flies up to the bag that Momo fired, which has “
   Yaoyorozu's Lucky Bag
   ” written on it. Inside he finds ethanol to get rid of the mushrooms and infrared goggles. With ethanol, Fumikage and Toru manage to prevent them from growing mushrooms through the body. And with the help of infrared goggles from Momo’s bag, Fumikage locates the Class 1-B students but was defeated due to a fungus that Kinoko caused to grow mushrooms in his windpipe.
  </p>
  <p key="38254604-d1bf-4cfc-9936-8c7ab099c460">
   Meanwhile, Toru locates Manga and attacks him. She is about to defeat him, but in that moment, Itsuka appears and captures her in her giant grip. Momo roped Itsuka to herself while she was still attached to the cannon. Itsuka knocked her unconscious, but now she can barely move because of the great weight she carries. Class 1-B comes out victorious with a 4-0 in the end of the second round of match-ups, but Itsuka doesn't feel victorious since Momo was always one step ahead.

  <p key="5abab8da-6277-4103-82a2-b8c555904670">
   Before the third round started, Itsuka accompanies Momo to the infirmary while looking on concerned.
   After a quick recovery, Momo joins her classmates to watch the rest of the Joint Training Battle. Afterwards, it’s revealed that Class 1-A won the entire exercise and a relieved Momo celebrates their outstanding victory over Class 1-B.
   Later, classes 1-A and 1-B hang out together after the exercise, showing that there are no hard feelings and happily socializing in the common area. Momo spends time talking to Itsuka.

   , to help to train the new generation of Heroes due to All Might's retirement. Weeks go by, and shortly after winter begins, after the Hero Interview Training, Class 1-A is sent to
   <a href="Nabu Island.html" key="83ebfb7a-d80f-406c-a520-e34db675027a" title="Nabu Island">
    Nabu Island
   </a>
   , a remote place in southern Japan. The Pro Heroes who protected the island are about to retire, so the students will take care of the place, performing duties as real heroes acting like their own "Hero Office", until the arrival of new Pro Heroes.
  </p>
  <p key="a95655d3-7005-4190-a6e4-8173c73ab7ca">
   Because Nabu Island is quite isolated from the rest of the country, and therefore far from any villain activity, there has been no notable incident since the last thirty years. For this reason, their work on the island basically involve mostly minor deeds. For example, Momo goes to help repair a motorcycle of one of the inhabitants. At night, after working all day, all Class 1-A students mention that despite they only did minor deeds, this kind of hero work is still hard, even though they're not fighting anyone. The grateful island citizens bring a bunch of food for the kids as a token of appreciation for their help. She and Tenya thank the neighbors for their meals.
  </p>
  <p key="c56ce448-8a21-4d73-844d-6abf60da92de">
   The next day, while Momo and several class 1-A students wait in the office waiting for requests, a neighbor and Fumikage arrive to report that the island is being attacked by a group of villains. Tenya quickly organize the class to face this crisis: She, Mina and Kyoka assist their classmate and Nabu inhabitants with medical evacuation. After Eijiro, Katsuki and Denki saved Yuga, Minoru and Toru from the villain
   Mummy
   , the girls bring them to safety as well as direct the citizens to the safe hold. When Mummy is defeated, Momo and Kyoka arrive to inform their classmates that they have already evacuated all the citizens of the area. Katsuki tells them to continue the evacuations as he heads off to find more villains.
  </p>
  <p key="63afac88-61e2-48d9-8ab2-1ce5143dcbf5">
   However, Class 1-A fails to defeat the remaining villains, and they are forced to retreat. At night, the Class A members regroup at a factory where the rest of the island citizens are currently staying at due to the villain attack. Momo uses her Quirk to the limit to create a large amount of supplies for the refugees, being aided by Denki. Kyoka shows concern for both of them, as they are overusing their Quirks, but Momo insists to keep on going.
  </p>
  <p key="01b3a031-0b15-4c55-9cf4-1f7e6402c931">
   Later, all the students have a meeting where they discover that the objective of the villain leader,
   <a href="Nine.html" key="a44bad67-ca7b-4146-af0a-7979773c532d" title="Nine">
    Nine
   </a>
   , is to steal the Cell Activation Quirk from a boy named Katsuma. With this information, they devise a plan to approach them in front and keep civilians safe. The plan is to lure the villains to the furthest corner of the island where ancient castle ruins are. The heroes will engage the villains using the terrain to their advantage and spit the villains apart, so each member has to face several students alone.
  </p>
  <p key="539f0bc6-aa5b-4a3e-8e07-30df4cfa2589">
   The next morning, Nine and his crew arrive at the entrance to the island. Momo Yaoyorozu and Yuga Aoyama are the first line of defense. Momo is very tired after using her Creation Quirk the night before by providing utilities for the evacuated islanders, but she is still willing to take on the villains. Next to her is a weapon she has created using her last fat reserves, and she keeps hidden under a large cloak with camouflage patterns.
  </p>
  <p key="ac4ddead-c350-475a-80d3-96b6373eb39d">
   Seeing the villains approaching, Momo orders Yuga to attack them with his Navel Laser Quirk. Yuga uses his super move "Can't Stop Twinkling: Supernova" to fire a massive naval laser bombardment at the villains. The villains avoid the blast, but Momo then removes the cloak, revealing two large cannons and begins firing at the villains. Nine blocks their attacks with his Air Wall Quirk, but Slice and Chimera are forced to break away, unaware that they are falling right into Class 1-A's trap. Momo and Yuga are completely exhausted, but the first phase is accomplished.
  </p>
  <p key="4f3261cd-b2cb-4421-9b90-313313dc0fd5">
   With Nine's allies driven to designated points, now only the leader remains. Class 1-A begins to attack Nine in turns to force him to use his Quirk as much as possible until he reaches the limit of his abilities. With Momo's help, Yuga continues to contribute to the fight, despite he has already reached the limit with his Quirk, until Nine finally defeats them.
  </p>
  <p key="b4a976c2-d528-42ce-84fb-8377a2fdf602">
   While she is unconscious, Izuku and Katsuki manage to defeat Nine, saving the island and its inhabitants in the process. After Class 1-A emerged victorious over the threat, the military and a large number of heroes arrive on Nabu Island, rescuing the civilians and medically treating Class 1-A. The villains are arrested, and Class 1-A continues to stay on Nabu Island to help repair the damage done by Nine and his villains until the Public Safety Commission suspends the program and orders them to be sent home.
  </p>
  <p key="bd7e8deb-82be-48f2-b246-bb9137f66223">
   With the island being repaired by the military and the heroes, Class 1-A boards a ferry to return to the U.A. High School.

   Panic spreads through the threatened cities, and the Heroes have to deal with both helping the citizens and finding the bombs before they go off.

Once the team finds the bombs, the heroes engages in an all-out war against the Humarise agents. In the end, they manages to get hold of the Trigger Bomb, however there is little time left for it to explode, so Big Red Dot uses his

   As Midnight's lying on the ground in a bad shape, she contacts Momo through their comms, and after confirming she knows the situation, she tells her that she needs to put Gigantomachia asleep with an anesthetic, even if it is against the law.

   Momo loses contact with Midnight as the others around her wonder what she was talking about. Momo tries to think of a plan before finally coming up with one. She orders Kyoka and Mezo to use their hearing to determine the time it will take him to arrive at their location and the path he will use. She also adds that Mezo can use his eyes since he is so massive. She asks Juzo to lend a hand as Kyoka reports that she can see him.

   They then notice Mt. Lady and Kamui Woods both holding on to Gigantomachia's leg, but they believe it will slow him down just a little bit. Momo creates anesthetics that she hands to her friends while saying that she never learned to be a Hero that shows their back to an enemy. She says she will fight and Denki agrees to back her up, because when they don their costumes and step outside, they become Heroes, regardless of whether or not they are students.
  </p>
  <p key="e02c6dcf-f0b1-4b83-8683-51a9f97edc51">
   The plan is to try to get Gigantomachia to swallow at least a 30-liter vial filled with sedative, because due to gargantuan's sheer size, injecting the sedative via syringe would be almost impossible. Following Momo's lead, the students set the trap for Gigantomachia. Juzo uses his Quirk to soften up the ground and Momo creates explosives with her Quirk and plant them in the softened areas. They also position several chords covered in Minoru's orbs.

  <p key="b8d585d0-ded8-41e5-afa4-9313b5c1868b">
   As they planned, Gigantomachia steps into the students' trap and he falls to the ground. The strings covered in Minoru's orbs stick to his chin, and while the giant tries to get out, several students pull the strings to force him open his mouth, while the others charge at him to give him the sedative.

   The lieutenants of the PLF who are on Gigantomachia’s back defend the monster and themselves from the students’ assault, with Dabi creating a fire barrier to prevent the students from getting close. The giant himself blows away several students with his powerful breath, but when he tries to get out of the softened earth, the bombs that Momo planted explode, causing him to sink even deeper. Several heroes come to help the students, with Mt. Lady pushing Gigantomachia down on the ground to open up his mouth for the sedative to be administered.

  <p key="52b7d229-a634-4479-a920-68fb78ee0454">
   Although Gigantomachia shakes off the heroes, Eijiro manages to throw a vial into his mouth. When he is about to crush him, Gigantomachia is attacked by the students who use various cannons created by Momo, who in turn is dedicated to driving her classmates away from the flames with the help of fireproof suits of her creation. Momo says that now that Gigantomachia has ingested the sedative, they need to make him move around so it will spread faster. She calls out to
   Majestic
   and he flies in with several other Pro Heroes to take him on.
  </p>
  <p key="4c88eba3-976c-474a-aef5-4db4a05fb652">
   However, annoyed by the constant interruptions, Gigantomachia transforms, taking on an armored appearance, and with his enormous strength he finally manages to get out of the trap and easily defeat the heroes, to continue on his way to Tomura, destroying everything in his path. The students of U.A. watch with complete horror at the destruction left by the monster, with Momo pointing out that the the only reason none of them are dead since they weren't considered worthy enemies. It is also revealed that Majestic used his Quirk to help the students get to safety, but not before telling all of them that they all made the right decisions and should never doubt it. Some of them wonder if the sedative will really have an effect on the Giant.

The class reveals over the past month they had been training with the Wild, Wild Pussycats in order to keep up with Izuku in the incoming conflict, and are now about to head out to continue their training.

   The class train amongst themselves in the courtyard, where during a lull, Denki asks that with Tomura and All For One weakened and Gigantomachia sedated, the fight should be easier now, but Katsuki and Momo tell them the three reasons why they're wrong. Katsuki says the first is that All For One is a master of "hide-and-seek", making it nearly impossible for them to track him down. Momo adds the second being that not only will Tomura be more complete in this battle, but also that they're only working with half of the available Heroes. Katsuki concludes the last point being the villains will be the one with the advantage to start the battle, so they'll need to call up everybody possible to prepare and help.

   The rest of the class soon realize that since they could only communicate with him when he contacted them, Denki figures out Izuku's point about "steering the villains" to enter the fight with Momo adding that Yuga may be the only one able to deceive All For One.

   Present Mic asks Class 1-A why, with them being the greatest victims after all this, they're so willing to trust him, and Tenya simply responds that what happened is in the past, and with them being unable to realize how he's been feeling all this time, they carry some responsibility, so they must reach out to him as friends in order for them to become equals again.
