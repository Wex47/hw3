   , and that he could not see more because he has only mastered 20% of One For All. Izuku remembers that during the sports festival, he told him the vestiges weren't actually conscious. All Might tells him that he never experienced that and his master never brought it up, which likely makes Izuku the first user of One For All to experience this phenomenon.
  </p>
  <p key="3c2c215f-8d71-45bd-976d-f0d41a4f76fe">
   However, All Might recalls a discussion with

   , where she told him that even if she dies, they will meet again within One For All. Izuku asks All Might about what All For One's brother meant by the "singularity"; after another question about the fuzzy appearance of All Might and two other prior users in the dream, All Might tells Izuku that he truly does not understand what happened that well and they should search for answers together. Deku agrees to try his best. He also tells All Might that his master was very beautiful. All Might cheers up.

   . Shota greets the two by sarcastically commenting on how well they get along, to which All Might tries to cover himself by saying Izuku was being pushy.

Hiryu realizes that communications between his team have been cut off, and before he can do anything, Tsuyu sends him flying with a powerful kick.

However, it was too late, and the heads of both students collide, and both are knocked unconscious.

   because he wanted to know more about the League of Villains from the class that faced them and figured he'd work with someone who he felt could keep up with him. As the internship continued, Fumikage started to feel frustrated and confused as to why someone as fast as him had picked him when all he was doing was cleaning up after Hawks did his job, causing him to feel he learned nothing that week.

   Back in the Joint Training battle, Shihai mocks Fumikage's ultimate move name and continues to evade Class 1-A by moving within shadows. As Fumikage readied himself for a fight, Shihai reveals that he was setting him up mentally since the beginning, as his real target was

   Just as Shihai was thinking how they'd never catch up to him in a place filled with shadows to move through, Fumikage catches up to him with his Super Move Black Fallen Angel.

   Fumikage rescues Yuga away from Shihai, and Momo tells Yuga to fire off his

   Kinoko helps her mushrooms grow by using spray bottles to humidify the area. With the mushrooms covering everything, Yuga loses sight of Shihai, who uses his Quirk to vanish into a black mushroom. Itsuka had devised her 1-B team's plan to take advantage of Shihai's Quirk against Fumikage's Dark Shadow. If this failed, Itsuka predicted the others would use Yuga's

   On the other side, Fumikage tries to save Yuga from Shihai again but is constantly held back by Kinoko's mushrooms and Manga's words, allowing him to imprison Yuga. Fumikage comes across Toru who is entirely covered by mushrooms. Fumikage realizes that the Class 1-B team is extremely strong, and if they don't find their locations, they're done for. Just then, the thing Momo launched arrives, and it turns out to be a

When she's about to win the match, she ends up getting grabbed by Itsuka with her Quirk, where Itsuka reveals to Manga that while she knocked Momo out, she ended up tying her up to the cannon, making it hard to move. She comments that Momo looked far ahead and was one step ahead of her, causing her to feel that she didn't win in the end.

Tetsutetsu claims Shoto that he's slowing down and Shoto replies that the same thing happens to him.

   When Juzo was preparing to harden the ground to trap Shoto, Tenya rushes in and kicks Juzo in the face, breaking his mask, and running off with the downed Shoto. The kick was so strong that Juzo begins to lose consciousness. He feels frustrated because his mistake of not having stopped Tenya before will mean the defeat of his team. Unable to let that happen, with a last ditch effort Juzo decides to soften a large pipe and yells at Tetsutetsu to push it. Tenya tries to run away at full speed while carrying Shoto, but the pipe falls on top of him and he is trapped. At the same time, both Juzo and Tetsutetsu also collapse and are out cold.

He then declares Sen as the MVP of the match, much to the latter's annoyance.
