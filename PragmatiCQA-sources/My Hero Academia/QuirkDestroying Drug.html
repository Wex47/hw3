   At the moment, the only known method to introduce the drug into someone is through the use of special bullets, red cartridges with hypodermic needles. Once the bullet hits the victim, the drug destroys the Quirk almost instantly.
   Alongside the drug, Kai also developed an antidote serum, which can nullify the effects of the drug and restore the victim's Quirk. However the drug can also be nullified by stopping the spread through the blood system by dismemberment, as

   was capable of stopping the drug by dismembering his own leg.
  </p>
  <p key="e93b1ac6-0214-4f7d-965c-66dae484e153">
   With these two products in his possession, Kai planned to resurrect the glory of the Shie Hassaikai, and the yakuza in general, by using the drug and the serum as a way to gather huge amounts of money as well as a tool to induce fear into the modern Quirk-dependent population. The drug was meant to be sold through the black market to

   and after a while, the yakuza would distribute a serum that would undo the damage done and restore the lost Quirks to the heroes.
  </p>
  <p key="179b90af-588c-4f4d-a444-45d414693cf7">
   These products would be at a high price. Therefore, with the villains having the Quirk-destroying bullets, the heroes having the serum, and Eri in the middle, the Shie Hassaikai can monopolize control of the market, earning massive profit and eventually emerging from the shadows.
  </p>
  <p key="d9275c30-24b3-46ae-9fee-033527decdb3">
   It's unknown what happened to the antidote serum after the

  <p key="b7755368-2852-49d2-ac84-c47aface780a">
   The idea of a drug that could destroy one's Quirk was originally conceived by Kai, who tried to convince his boss, the former leader of the Shie Hassaikai, to allow the boss' granddaughter to have her body, which had manifested an unusual Rewind Quirk, used as a source of genetic material in order to cultivate said drug. Kai's plan was rejected by his boss due to its unethical nature, which led Kai to incapacitate his boss and take over the reins of the Shie Hassaikai.

   </a>
   , as he could destroy and restore her body infinitely), the Shie Hassaikai were able to experiment and develop a drug prototype that could damage one's Quirk Factor, the biological mechanisms behind the functioning of Quirks. The effects of this prototype, however, were only temporary, and thus were distributed solely for testing purposes. The prototype was primarily distributed in the form of injection bullets that could be fired into someone's bloodstream, disabling their Quirk for a few hours.
  </p>
  <p key="12b6de7f-bbf9-4dd0-afd3-2e62515925b0">
   Requiring further funding, the Shie Hassaikai were able to strike an alliance with the League of Villains, who had an interest in the drug, having witnessed its effects during a
   skirmish
   with the Shie Hassaikai themselves. In a short amount of time, the drug was perfected, having its effects now become permanent. Additionally, a serum that could be used to restore the destroyed Quirks was created alongside the finished drug, is meant to be sold as well.
