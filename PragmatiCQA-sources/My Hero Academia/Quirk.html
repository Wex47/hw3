   Quirks are said to be the next stage of evolution in the human race. It is possible, though rudimentary, to diagnose a person as possessing or lacking a Quirk by analyzing the presence or absence of an extra joint in their pinky toe. People with only one joint tend to develop a Quirk, while having two joints usually indicates that the person is Quirkless. The lack of the extra joint makes a person's body more "streamlined", a secondary aspect of human evolution brought about by the emergence of Quirks.

   Quirks are extensions of a person's bodily functions. As such, they can be trained and worn out. When a person works out their muscles, the muscle fibers are destroyed and new, stronger ones grow back; this same rule applies to Quirks. However, should a Quirk be overused, the user could suffer any of a variety of drawbacks, depending on the nature of the Quirk. These drawbacks are usually simple ailments, such as dry skin or nausea; however, in some cases, the drawback can be much more severe.

  <p key="da8be5f0-cd8f-42bb-a411-c87582e77b1b">
   The body of a Quirk user has natural adaptations to protect itself from any damage the Quirk might do to them without these natural defenses. For example, someone who can breathe fire does not burn their mouth when using their ability. However, there are instances where a Quirk doesn't suit the user's body and the body can't handle it. Such conditions can be bypassed through the use of support equipment, such as
   Yuga Aoyama's belt
   . Some people simply have a body that is not properly suited for their Quirk,

   Another facet of Quirks is that they are affected by the user’s emotions, given that they serve as a part of their physiology. This applies to some Quirks more than others, such as

   Every Quirk contains an echo of the consciousness of its wielder; if a person's Quirk is transferred to someone else, the consciousness of the previous wielder will appear in the new user's mind, either as voices in dreams or manifestations in a mental mindscape. This phenomenon is compared to cases of people whose personalities and tastes changed after an organ transplant. If further transferred to yet another new user, then that new user will experience the consciousnesses of all of the previous users. Though, these consciousnesses will disappear if the new user loses the transferred Quirk.

   refers to the collective physical and genetic traits that compose a person's Quirk. This includes the primary Quirk power, as well as all the biological mechanisms that allow said primary power to function properly. The term Quirk Factor can also be used to refer to the part of ones body that utilizes the Quirk. For example,

  <p key="fc79ddbe-8064-408d-ad64-cc58a2782883">
   Under special circumstances, a second Quirk can be added to a person's genetics. However, gaining multiple Quirks often puts immense strain on the inheritor, rendering them as mindless living dolls incapable of speaking. It was initially believed a person can tolerate two Quirks at most, should they be physically fit, as was the case with the One For All users, but it turns out they too suffered from the backlash of carrying two Quirks, which resulted in a significantly decreased lifespan.
  </p>
  <p key="f34e16b4-c3f5-4ad4-ab5c-2d667b1cac4f">
   Presently, there are only three known people who have been able to wield multiple Quirks without suffering from this Quirk overload, All For One,

   , Nine, and Tomura Shigaraki. It is potentially possible that a Quirk that can heal the body or provide more energy to the user can supersede the negative effects of holding multiple Quirks, as seen through Gigantomachia's

   It is also possible for a Quirk Factor to not only be extracted from the body, but also replicated, enhanced, and created. Kyudai Garaki had developed a way to duplicate Quirk Factors, allowing multiple individuals to possess the same Quirk. He had also obtained a large collection of various different Quirk Factors, both through duplication and extraction from the original body, which through a procedure could be forcefully implemented into a body, as shown through the

   , are capable of temporarily halting the expression of the Quirk Factor, rendering the Quirk unusable for a short period, but not affecting the Quirk Factor otherwise. There are other Quirks, however, that are able to directly damage the Quirk Factor of a target, preventing the Quirk from being activated until the user manages to naturally recover. It's also possible that a Quirk Factor can be damaged beyond recovery, causing the Quirk to be permanently suppressed.

   Quirks are inherited genetically through what appears to be
   Mendelian inheritance
   . A child will either inherit the father's Quirk, the mother's Quirk, or a completely new Quirk formed by a fusion of the two. Depending on the parents, this new Quirk may sometimes give the appearance of the person having two separate Quirks, such as Shoto Todoroki's Half-Cold Half-Hot.
  </p>
  <p key="c80af311-52da-4a9b-9f7c-c0642c4c11ee">
   Naturally, since Quirks are inherited genetically, siblings tend to have Quirks that are similar to each other. An example of this is the Ida brothers; the older brother,

   There can also be instances of Quirk "Re-Awakenings", where ones Quirk becomes limited due to certain circumstances, before then returning to its original potential. The primary example is with Tomura's Decay Quirk, which had initially displayed a devastating amount of power when it was first developed, but then became greatly scaled back due to him repressing the traumatic moments of killing his family. It wasn't until undergoing immense trauma that these memories returned to him, allowing him to re-gain the Quirk's true power.

   The theory of "Quirk Singularity" is a popular line of thinking that suggests that Quirks will continue to mix together and deepen, growing in both strength and complexity with every new generation. Eventually, Quirks will develop to a point where no one will be able to control them anymore.

   In an effort to preserve order in the superhuman society, there are several laws and procedures in place to ensure the conscientious use of Quirks. Public display of Quirks is against the law,
   as is using them with the intention to harm other people, except in cases of self-defense, such as when one is under attack or preventing someone else from being attacked.
   Despite this, the notion of Quirks not being used in public is sometimes ignored or overlooked, being compared to an old rule of not riding bicycles on sidewalks, although doing so would still be an infraction of the law. Certain Quirks also have more regulations than others to prevent their abuse, like

   When it comes to heroes, it is also possible for the specifics of their Quirks to be kept classified by their nation's government. An example of this is All Might, whose Quirk was kept secret to protect the truth of One For All.

   Furthermore, electricity-based Quirks are said to be highly valued in the job market, which is why heroes with electric Quirks are quite rare.
   This proves that people aside from heroes can use their Quirks for work purposes.

   Quirks come in a very wide variety, as the name Quirk implies, they are unique to each individual. However, Quirks can be divided into categories based on what they do and how they function, known as Quirk types. Some Quirks cause a permanent physical abnormality to the user's body, known as Mutant-type. Some cause the user's body to undergo a temporary physical abnormality when the power is used, known as Transformation-type. Finally, some Quirks don't cause any abnormalities to the user's physical body at all, known as Emitter-type.

  <p key="8065160d-d39c-4400-a807-7280735e1ee8">
   Aside from the three Quirk Types, Quirks can also be categorized into sub-types. A Quirk can fall into a given sub-type regardless of what type it is. In other words, a given sub-type can be designated to Quirks of all three types, so long as the Quirks possess an aspect that fulfills the requirement to be considered as part of that sub-type.

   Quirks are abilities that cause the user a permanent "abnormality" directly related to their power. Mutant-type Quirks create bodily structures that grant the user more complex abilities that Emitter and Transformation Quirks cannot safely provide. Often times they will bestow prehensile

   Mutant-type Quirks are also the only known type of Quirk which can be passed down through generations without necessarily bestowing the corresponding ability, such as with Fumikage and his bird-like head that has nothing to do with his Dark Shadow, or Koji's rock-like head which speaks nothing of his Anivoice Quirk. As a result of this, while it's uncertain how common Mutant-type Quirks are, it can be safely assumed they are the most commonly inherited.

   While not necessarily a weakness, Mutant-type Quirks cannot be turned off, and sometimes cause the user inconvenience due to their malformations. Such is the case with

   Quirk makes it impossible for him to wear clothing with sleeves. Though because these Quirks are passively active, they are partially immune to Quirk-disabling effects such as that of Shota Aizawa's Erasure Quirk. Since Mutant Quirks are passively active, they are the most identifiable at a glance.

   Users with Mutant-type Quirks, most often known as "heteromorphs", also find themselves the most discriminated against, even by other Quirk users, due to their outer appearances. Mezo always wears a mask over his mouth due to not wanting to scare others, and people like
