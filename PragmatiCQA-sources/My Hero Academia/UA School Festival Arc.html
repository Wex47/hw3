   On top of a building, La Brava informs Gentle that their video of the store robbery isn't getting a lot of views. Gentle sees that he will have to accomplish a lot more if he wants people to start taking notice of him. While pouring tea, Gentle tells La Brava that he is searching for something that will make him extraordinary.

  <p key="129585c3-6893-4d9d-85b5-a1da03a1cd5d">
   Later, in his "secret base", La Brava uploads the video of their latest robbery. In the video, Gentle labels himself as a modern-day gentleman thief, who punish those who behave in an ungentlemanly way. For example, the convenience store that he robbed the other day belongs to one of the largest chain in Japan and has come under fire for some shady business tactics, like hiding expiration dates of Plump Pudding.

   However, Gentle is not disparaged about their popularity because his new project will surpass even theirs and place him in the limelight. His next project which involves U.A. High School's Festival. As the school was fortified after being attacked and is the current symbol of the Heroes, Gentle believes that if he invades the festival, then he will become the center of attention.

   Later, at Height Alliance, Class 1-A is deciding who will be the members of the musical band. Katsuki is shown to be a talented drummer and Kyoka wants him for the band. However, he doesn’t want to due to the fact the other departments are mad at them and their attempts to please will only look as self satisfaction from 1-A and will not accept it. Although this generates comments among his classmates, Katsuki clarifies if they are going to do a musical performance, they should do it for the sake of it and not to please or help people, and furthermore, if they're going to do it, they need to go all out. Katsuki announces that he will blow everyone away in U.A. with his sound. Class 1-A is surprised with Katsuki's willingness to participate but many agree with his sentiment.

Kyoka is chosen to play the bass. That's when Izuku, Ochaco, Tsuyu and Eijiro come back. Ochaco then asks who's singing vocals and voices out her opinion for Kyoka to sing, which she nervously refuses. Yuga, Minoru and Eijiro offer to sing, but Eijiro sings a complete different genre, Minoru just screams and Yuga sings falsetto. Toru agrees with Ochaco and gives Kyoka the mic, despite her protests. After hearing Kyoka's beautiful voice, everyone unanimously agrees that she will be Class 1-A's vocalist and also will play the bass.

   With the band composed, everyone else will dance, but Mina quickly goes on to discuss the staging, as they need effects to set the mood. She has an idea: Eijiro can continuously shave off ice created by Shoto which when combined with a laser light show produced by Yuga will look like stardust. By 1:00 AM, an exhausted Tenya announces that they have all of Class 1-A's roles for the dance hall live performance organized. Kyoka will lead the band with Momo, Katsuki, Denki, and Fumikage. Eijiro will lead the staging team with Hanta, Koji, Yuga, and Shoto. Mina will lead everyone else in the dance team, with Yuga also participating as the improvised disco ball.

    One For All

   at 20%, but it took a toll on his body and he could only use it for a short period of time, and admits that he only won against Overhaul thanks to Eri. Not only that, he could not do much against Overhaul's long-range attacks. All Might advises him that he should use ranged combat as well, which surprises Izuku.

   In U.A's school grounds forest sector, Toshinori asks Izuku to activate his

   </a>
   at 20%, and then, remaining in position, unleash an attack. Izuku obeys and, fighting through the pain, he jumps up and kicks, which releases wind pressure that shakes the trees. After this demonstration, All Might explains that Izuku is reaching a new level of power: being able to release wind pressure without breaking his body. He had been intending to teach the technique when Izuku reached an overall level of 15 percent but decided to do it now to address his pressing need.
  </p>
  <p key="fe1bc013-65a5-4623-998d-179495888b19">
   All Might recaps Izuku's training and progress with his Quirk: using One For All at 100% at one part of his body; controlling a percentage of his power at one part of his body; controlling a percentage of his power across his entire body; developing his Shoot Style and switching from punches to kicks; raising his overall level from 5 percent to 8 percent; and just recently, concentrating and drawing out 20 percent of his power for a short time.
  </p>
  <p key="6df92f54-e9e8-4b5f-88ad-ffb404e572e7">
   Thanks to his exposition, Izuku realizes that he's actually copying All Might's technique of power control; since having too much power out at once would result in collateral damage, All Might only unleashed it when needed: much like Izuku is doing now. What he has to do is use One For All 20% in one area for just long enough to let it create a wind-based attack: minimizing both the strain to his body and the risk of collateral damage. Toshinori cautions that following that route will require a higher degree of control and precision. Following Toshinori's advice, Izuku decides to train with his fingers, as they allow for more control.

   A week passes and Mina tells Izuku that he has been removed from the dance team and requested by the staging team. Izuku is shocked at first since he had promised Eri that he would dance. Mina informs him that they plan on using Yuga Aoyama's Quirk to act like a disco ball and require Izuku's super strength to maneuver Yuga from the rafters while he's above the audience. Eijiro apologizes to Izuku for doing this, Izuku decides to go along with their new plan as long as he gets a turn to dance.

   The next morning, at 6:30, Izuku continues training under All Might's supervision. Izuku is struggling to shoot wind pressure attacks with his fingers and asks All Might for any advice, but he doesn't have any. Suddenly All Might catches a mechanical flying eye that suddenly appears. Immediately after, Mei shows up to retrieve it. Mei notices Izuku and tells him the item that he requested is similar to one of her inventions, so she's altering it for his use, Izuku thanks her.

All Might approves the usage of gadgets and support items, as long as he doesn't rely too much on them, and surprises Izuku by revealing that he had once used support equipment. Over time, though, he found them too bulky and ineffective at his preferred close range, so he chose to fight relying on his own body. They continue training.

   In Heights Alliance, Class 1-A is taking a break and Momo has received special tea from her mother called Phantom Black Tea "Gold Tips Imperial". As Momo prepares to let her classmates try the tea, Ochaco asks Izuku if he wants some, but he is busy looking for an online video regarding All Might using support items. Izuku accidentally taps on a video on black tea by Gentle. At the end of his video about premium Black Tea "Royal Flush" he announces that his next video will be about society receiving a wake up call. Izuku notes that Gentle Criminal is an infamous villain known for his online videos, impressed that he has never been arrested for it and ponders about his future plans.

   Meanwhile, Gentle has been working non-stop in his new plan and La Brava brings him some tea. Gentle notes that dissatisfaction is growing towards Heroes nowadays because of their feeble minded nature. La Brava wonders if Gentle will involve the U.A. students, to which he finds that simply invading U.A.'s School Festival in it of itself is a wake up call for them to grow stronger, which La Brava finds cool.

   On his computer, Gentle decides to double check the route they will take to get to U.A.'s School Festival. First, they have to go to a lonesome house that is actually a café where he can enjoy 90 minutes of teatime, drinking Gold Tips Imperial tea. Afterwards, He vows that they will infiltrate U.A. They will mask their scent with dirt to avoid being detected by Hound Dog, who will be responsible for patrolling the perimeter. And to pass U.A,'s Barrier, La Brava will use her hacking skills to infiltrate U.A.'s internal network and disable the sensors.

   Gentle is glad to have a partner like her and remembers when he started his criminal activity. At first, he struggled with using social media and his videos did not attract any attention, until one day Manami Aiba came to his place after hacking his account to get his address, proclaiming to be his fan and eager to help him to carve his name into history. Gentle says that at first, he was afraid of that situation, but thanks to her help and computer skills his popularity increased.

   La Brava gets goosebumps by Gentle's words but he pats on her head and ensures her that he will make the U.A. infiltration a success not only to secure the future of the world but as a response to her love. Crying tears of joy, La Brava hugs Gentle and proclaims her love for him., to which Gentle reiterates the same line of thought and vows to succeed in their U.A. School Festival infiltration.

   The night before the school festival, Class 1-A is in the gym making their final preparations for their musical performance, with Mina working hard to have the dance choreograph precisely. The practice is cut short when Hound Dog arrives to tell them it's nine p.m. and they must return to their rooms.

   In Heights Alliance, some of the students are too excited to sleep. Izuku and Yuga are checking the stuff for their disco ball routine when Izuku realizes that the rope is frayed from overusing it during the practices. Denki advises him to ask Momo to create another rope but Mina tells him that she is sleeping right now. Izuku says he'll just buy a new one. He has to go into town to buy some things, and there's a hardware store that opens early along the way. Before all going to sleep, Class 1-A vows to make their School Festival event a success.

   The day of the festival has arrived. At 6:30 AM, Izuku is training with Toshinori Yagi when a filthy Mei shows up and gives Izuku the support equipment he requested:
   a pair of gloves
   specially made to allow him to use long ranged attacks via air pressure generated from his hands. A happy Izuku thanks Mei for her hard work and Toshinori is impressed by how compact the support equipment is. Before leaving, Mei gives Izuku the gloves' manual, and Toshinori asks him to test them, with which Izuku agrees.

   Izuku gets so wrapped up practicing his new gloves that he almost loses track of time. It's not until 7:50 AM that Izuku rushes out to buy the things he needs while still wearing the gloves. At 8:30 AM he acquires the rope and is on his way back to U.A. when he runs into Gentle and La Brava in disguise just coming out of the café (next door to the hardware store). Gentle mentions Gold Tips Imperial tea which Izuku remembers as the tea Momo served to everyone the other night. When Izuku recognizes the rare tea and mentions having learned of it from a classmate, Gentle surmises Izuku goes to an elite school and realizes it must be U.A. At the same time, Izuku recognizes the voice, remembers the video he and Ochaco watched before, and identifies the stranger as Gentle. Realizing Gentle is about to infiltrate U.A., Izuku pleads for him not to go through with his plan.

   Despite being hit, Gentle Criminal refuses to give up, but Izuku rebounds off a power pole and grabs hold of Gentle, crashing towards a construction site, as La Brava cries out. The crash to the construction site attracted the attention of an old man. La Brava tries to convince him that they are filming and to pass on to his neighbors, hoping to buy some time for Gentle to retreat.

   Izuku has landed on the construction site and recovers quickly, thanking Mei Hatsume for building the gloves in time to stop Gentle as well as Mina for balancing his stance with her dance lessons. On the other hand, Gentle's coat gets stuck on a beam and he gently swings himself around while telling Izuku he will not get agitated, because a true gentleman never panics. Refusing to waver, Gentle plans on going through with his infiltration while Izuku asks about Gentle's objective.

   Izuku tells Gentle that the moment he enters U.A. the alarm will go off and the festival will be cancelled immediately (because of principal Nezu's assurances to the police). Gentle assures him that he does not have to worry about that because his partner in crime will disable the alarm system, which will make the festival proceed on and allow his infiltration to succeed. Izuku quickly refutes his argument saying that it will make an even bigger problem, and Gentle can’t deny that Izuku is right, which shocks La Brava again.

   Deku tries to bluff Gentle with a false report to the police forces but Gentle wants to accomplish his goal, no matter what, and the battle resumes. Gentle uses his Quirk again, bouncing around the construction site by causing all the girders to become elastic, and causing Izuku to simply be unable to calculate or predict Gentle's movements due to all the bounciness of the girders, as well as causing the air to be bouncy. Izuku shoots Gentle, but he uses his Quirk to make the attack rebound, hitting Deku himself. As Izuku stumbles, La Brava suggests retreating but Gentle plans on dealing with Izuku first.

   As Izuku recovers, Gentle removes the nuts and bolts from a construction beam due to them being turned into elastic, and tells it's about to snap as it is still bouncing whilst recovering its original hardness. Gentle jumps from the collapsing construction beam, forcing Izuku to jumps in the way of the steel beam to catch it with both hands and prevents it from falling on top of the civilian La Brava met before. Izuku is angered because Gentle tried to harm an innocent person, but Gentle retorts that he expected Izuku to avoid that incident, assuring him that he was going to bounce the beam away from the civilian if Izuku didn't move. With Izuku occupied, Gentle tries to escape with La Brava by turning a crane's hook into elastic and launching themselves towards U.A.

   At the construction site, Izuku puts down the steel beam and uses the same elasticized crane hook to launch himself towards Gentle and La Brava, who have landed in a forest outside U.A. Izuku sees Gentle in firing range and, remembering the positions of the elastic aerial barriers Gentle created, Izuku jumps off on them to gets behind Gentle, ready to shoot. The villain quickly covers himself with a barrier to intercept the blast, but Izuku aims upward, remembering the earlier barriers and using them to ricochet his attack and score a clean hit on Gentle, injuring him. La Brava goes to help Gentle, but Izuku pins them both to the ground and asks them to surrender.

   Gentle dodges Deku's air blast, as both the villain and La Brava are shocked at the boy's persistence and can't believe that "Lover Mode" failed them. Deku and Gentle clash ferociously, with Izuku pleading Gentle to stop his attack on U.A. La Brava apologizes to Gentle saying her love wasn't enough but Gentle tells her no one can say her feelings weren't enough. He attacks Izuku with a

   Izuku manages to tunnel into the ground to escape the Gently Sandwich. He gets behind Gentle, pulls him by the coat tails, and asks him why he would choose to trample on the dreams of all those at U.A. by intruding and causing the Festival to be canceled. Gentle replies this is how it is, and he will do whatever it takes to make his dream come true. He creates an elastic aerial barrier against Izuku. Predicting this, Izuku jumps above and charges at Gentle, refusing to let him rob all the U.A's students' passion and especially the chance for Eri to learn happiness.

   Gentle thinks back towards his high school years, when he was 18. The then Danjuro Tobita failed his classes, was held back, and failed the provisional license exam four times, counselors advise him that his goal of being a hero is proving too difficult, but he is pressured to persevere because of the success of a rival classmate. He is then shown to attempt to rescue a civilian but in doing so he gets in the way of the Pro Hero who was also trying to save them and the civilian ended up getting severely injured, Danjuro is charged with interfering with a Pro Hero and now has a criminal record.

  <p key="c9972321-04d2-45e6-bd4c-5b6b098c16bf">
   Following this, Danjuro dropped out of school, his parents kicked him out, and he was forced to get by on his own. Then, four years later, he meets the same rival classmate who by this point had become a Pro Hero, but when he speaks with him, the classmate does not recognize him. This devastates Danjuro who can't believe he is almost completely forgotten already. It was in this fit of depression that he uncovered a book on the history of villainy. Danjuro resolves then to become remembered by the world...as the villain Gentle Criminal.

   Back at the fight, Gentle continues his assault towards Izuku, with La Brava observing the combat, concerned that Gentle is using Lover Mode to fight Izuku rather than to retreat like he normally does. Enraged, Gentle yells at Izuku to go ahead and laugh at him because it does not matter since he knows what is important to him. Gentle and Izuku clash once more with Izuku blocking Gentle's enhanced punch with his enhanced might. Izuku replies that he is not laughing at Gentle's passion as La Brava begs for Gentle to be victorious.

   La Brava cheers for Gentle, boosting Lover Mode even more, to the point that Gentle starts to overpower Izuku. As they struggle, Gentle asks him why does he want to be a hero. Izuku replies that he is like him. His dream is no longer his own anymore and he will achieve it for the sake of all those who believed in him. Given the chance to achieve a goal his body wasn't born to achieve, he wants to show the world a bright future. Gentle smiles at Izuku's reply and tosses him away.

   La Brava takes the opportunity and brings out her computer and use her special wireless technology to hack into U.A's internal network to disarm its security. However, La Brava is out of range and is forced to move closer. Izuku sees this but Gentle plans on keeping Izuku occupied longer. Gentle tells Izuku that if he really thinks that he is not as strong as those he has faced before, then he will abandon all notions of shame, honor and dignity in order to defeat him, as a sign of respect for the man Izuku has proven to be. Gentle creates several aerial elastic barriers and jumps from them all over the vicinity, ready to attack Izuku.

The force of the attack sends Gentle hard into the ground, Lover Mode is beginning to fade (its effect is temporary and can only be used once per day), and he no longer has the strength to continue fighting.

Gentle is glad that his last fight was with Izuku as La Brava cries inconsolably.

   Seeing Izuku's injures, Hound Dog asks if he fought Gentle Criminal. The young hero replies Gentle was trying to pull a prank on U.A and they just had a small disagreement but that everything is OK now. Dog and Ectoplasm are a bit perplexed, but then

  <p key="19b8ff80-6dc9-499b-a8f7-0dee4ea2dcf0">
   Before he is taken, Gentle tells Izuku that he used to be enrolled in the Hero Course but became a villain due to him having dropped out. Although it is not his place to say this, Gentle tells Izuku he hopes that his feelings can reach others.

   One of the Ectoplasm clones informs Izuku that All Might is worried about him and there is less than an hour left for Class 1-A's performance to start, much to Izuku's worry. Izuku realizes that he has forgotten his bag of items and needs to get it; an Ectoplasm clone accompanies Izuku back to the café where Izuku first encountered Gentle en route, they find and recover La Brava's camera.
  </p>
  <p key="5cbdc66d-f3d4-4471-ac39-7fa69b277257">
   As they run to retrieve his purchases, Izuku thinks about how Gentle was his toughest opponent so far, as he could have strayed from his path like Gentle did because they share similar thoughts and feelings. It is 9:35 AM and an elderly gentleman has found Izuku's bag, whom Izuku thanks. Meanwhile, Eri wonders if Izuku is going to dance as an excited crowd begins emerging to see Class 1-A's live dance performance. Class 1-A is stressing that Izuku has not arrived back yet.
  </p>
  <p key="1c0350cc-78e5-474b-acc1-8ecd7acd5e89">
   Thankfully, Izuku arrives in time at 9:50 AM, and Yuga Aoyama, who was waiting for him at the entrance, gives him his suit for the performance. Yuga inquires about Izuku's injuries, to which the latter excuses as having fell. Ectoplasm also suggests Izuku to clean up before the show. The clock turns 10:00 AM, and Class 1-A's performance begins. The curtains open up and as the crowd begins cheering. In spite of everything that happened to him, Izuku manages to join his classmates on stage, hand raised and smiling. This is the moment he'd been striving for: the chance to see Eri smile.

   Many people have gathered to see and enjoy Class 1-A show, although some of them, like Tsutsutaka and Chikuchi, are skeptical over how a musical performance can really be that good and worthy of so much focus. On stage, Kyoka takes a deep breath as the lights dim.
  </p>
  <p key="e7ac1f3b-b06e-4819-8899-02acf93deeba">

   from Katsuki, Class 1-A begins their musical performance. From the very beginning, the performance is loud and energetic, pumping the audience with their signing and dancing. Everyone is pleasantly surprised by the electrifying show, even the U.A. upperclassmen who showed up simply to criticize them are unable to hide their enjoyment and start cheering and dancing with everyone else.
  </p>
  <p key="10cf94ce-b9a5-4f3c-ad25-5b5321d5d143">
   As the rest of the audience cheer on, Kyoka thinks back when she told her parents that she wanted to be a hero instead of a musician like them. Her parents were very accepting of her decision.

   then points out that bringing joy to people is something heroes and musicians have in common. Kyoka finally understands, music can be heroic, she doesn't need to separate the two. Freed from her insecurities, Kyoka delivers a passionate, enthusiastic performance, and this energy reverberates with her classmates and with the audience.
  </p>
  <p key="7b6e7008-5cb4-483e-ac09-185107e109d2">
   The performance is so lively that it finally makes Eri smile. Slowly, Overhaul's grip on Eri's psyche breaks, and Eri is finally able to feel the excitement of the performance. Mirio cries tears of joy to see Eri finally break out in a warm, joyous smile. As the show finally ends, the audience cheers in a thunderous ovation.

   U.A.'s School Festival continues with Class 1-B putting on its stage play with the audience enjoying it. Some of Class 1-A would have liked to see Class 1-B's stage play but they must clean up the mess from their performance. Izuku, on the hand, is reprimanded by All Might for having forgotten his cellphone. Toshinori is well aware of the situation from Hound Dog and Ectoplasm.
  </p>
  <p key="be70e307-d062-4754-a637-2e39ba3632b5">
   Then, Izuku is scolded by Hound Dog for his recklessness during the Gentle Criminal intrusion. He may have saved the festival from being canceled but he should rely on the teachers to protect the school. Izuku acknowledges his fault which satisfies Hound Dog who sends him back towards the festival, telling him to have fun. Toshinori thanks Ryo who gets overexcited and starts playfully attacking Toshinori.

   Izuku returns with his classmates to help them to clean up the gym. Once there, he meets up with Eri and Mirio Togata. Eri excitedly recounts her impressions of the concert to Izuku, who can barely contain his tears of joy at seeing her so happy. Their conversation is interrupted when Minoru aggressively orders Izuku to help them.

  <p key="3ec673aa-230a-4d84-af99-b7f5878df0c3">
   As Class 1-A cleans up, some of the audience show up praise Class 1-A's performance. Tsutsutaka and Chikuchi in particular apologize towards Class 1-A as they had attended their performance with the intention of criticizing them. Katsuki smirks as he revels in his "victory" over the U.A. upperclassmen. Thanks to word of mouth, even some of the students who didn't personally see the concert received the feelings that the class had poured into their act. Class 1-A students thank them for their praise.

   Minoru tells them not to waste time and finish cleaning everything as soon as possible, as the beauty pageant is about to start. At the beauty pageant, Itsuka Kendo, Bibimi Kenranzaki, and Nejire Hado battle it out for the title. Itsuka demonstrates her martial arts skills and Bibimi rides a large vehicle modeled after her distinctive face. Then, it's Nejire's turn. Rather than trying to outdo Bibimi in flashiness, she presents herself more naturally: using her
   Wave Motion
   to draw a rose in the air above the stage while she danced and twirled above the audience like an innocent fairy. After the presentations, open voting commences, with the results to be announced at the closing event of the festival. Nejire is eventually declared the winner with Bibimi humbly accepting her defeat.

   Until then, students in class 1-A are dedicated to enjoying the other events and attractions of the festival. Izuku spends much having fun with Eri, Mirio, Ochaco, etc. until he must leave to cook something with Rikido's help. Eventually, it is time for Eri to leave. She is a little sad that everything is over, but Izuku manages to cheer her up by giving her a candied apple that he had cooked himself because he realized no food stand would be selling them. Grateful and happy, Eri enjoys the gift. Shota Aizawa and Mirio escort her back to the hospital as Izuku waves goodbye to them.

   At the Police Station, the investigators are astounded by Manami Aiba's hacking talent and wonder if she has ever used her advanced computer skills for the sake of the world, to which she states that everything she does is for Gentle's sake.

   Meanwhile, Danjuro is being interrogated by a gorilla-looking investigator. Danjuro tries to minimize Manami's sentence, by blaming himself for all the crimes, but the investigator doesn't buy it since there is mutual love between the two instead of brainwashing. After reviewing Danjuro's record, notes that it's a good thing they were able to stop him before he hit rock bottom and that he has motivation to rebuild his life unlike those who are lazy or those who rush to get results.

  <p key="797c240e-5b86-4fac-a184-9b24df15d4a9">
   Danjuro can't help but cry at his words. The investigator decides to get tea and ask Danjuro if he wants some, to which Danjuro requests black tea but the investigator angrily denies Danjuro's request and goes to get instant tea.
