Hawks informs the association's director that none of the captured cultists they interrogated know anything about the whereabouts of the devices, so he assumes that only members of Flect Turn's inner circle know of their existence.

   Izuku, who is still looking for Rody not far from there, sees the accident, though Shoto tells him to keep chasing after him while he deals with the car crash. After verifying that he is alright, Rody grabs the briefcase supposedly meant to contain the jewelry, and runs towards the subway station when he sees Izuku again, who goes after him. They are spotted by Beros, who picks up Alan's alleged briefcase.

   Rody rushes into a train just as it is leaving, and thinks that he has finally managed to give Izuku the slip, but he ends totally surprised when he sees the young hero reach the train after catching up to it on foot. At the next subway stop, Izuku questions Rody about why he was running, and orders him to show what's inside the briefcase. Rody doesn't want to do it, arguing that he is a foreign hero who has no jurisdiction in Otheon, which triggers a fight over the briefcase before the two, dropping it where they realize it only contains documents, books, and notepads, confusing the two, especially Rody.

   Back on the bridge, Shoto is able to spot the crash and freeze the car to prevent it from exploding. There, he notices the large holes on the car. Nearby, unknown to the police, Beros checks the briefcase, only to find it containing the untraceable, uncut diamonds. She informs her leader, Flect Turn, about the situation, and he orders her to continue tracking Alan's case while he also takes some measures to get it back.

   At the subway stop, Izuku exaggeratedly apologizes to Rody for taking him for a thief, to which Rody tries to brush off, though inwardly he is completely freaked out that he doesn't have the briefcase with the stolen jewelry.

   Barely hiding his anxiety, Rody leaves the place, taking the wrong briefcase with him. Seeing his nervousness, Izuku follows him to make sure everything is alright, but shortly after leaving the subway, the Otheon police arrive. All the officers point their guns at the frightened Rody and order him to surrender. Izuku tries to defuse the situation, but suddenly Rody runs away clutching the briefcase strongly. The police respond with a shoot-to-kill order and begin to fire at Izuku and Rody.

   Back at the hotel where the Otheon team is staying, Endeavor reprimands both Shoto and Katsuki for disobeying direct orders to standby and for stopping a petty thievery instead, and demands to know where Izuku is. Shoto claims that Izuku was chasing after the third person suspected of helping the jewelry villains, but he hasn't called back or answered his phone. Right on cue, Izuku gets in contact with Shoto, explaining the situation with him being shot of by the police and a villain.

   In Otheon, Izuku and Rody are now wanted fugitives by the authorities. Rody is completely mad because he has been declared Izuku's accomplice, and demands him to explain how his life went south like this. He cannot give him a clear answer, much to Rody's discouragement. Izuku figures out that the reason for the police to be shooting at them was because of the briefcase that Rody stole, but after checking it, nothing that seems important is found.

   Rody suggests to hand the briefcase over to the police to clear their names, but Izuku advises against it because those who want it would kill them anyway. Rody then suggests other options to get rid of the briefcase, but Izuku dismisses all of them as it wouldn't change their situation. In short, Izuku and Rody decide to make their way over to another place where the Otheon police won't have jurisdiction. They change out their clothes and disguise themselves as native tourists to avoid being spotted by anyone and the police. The two begin their journey by climbing onto the roof of a bus.

Furthermore, she also informs Shoto that the briefcase that contains the uncut, untraceable jewelry were left near at the scene of the crime. Shoto later receives a coded message from Izuku, which he figures out as revealing his intended new destination to Klayd.

   After several hours traveling, Izuku and Rody take a break inside of an old farmhouse to get some rest for the night before they can move again. Rody becomes distressed over leaving his siblings alone, remembering the unbearable childhood of his past. He remembers when he and his siblings lived with their father,

   Rody can't bear the idea of his siblings suffering even more for not being with them for those moments, so overnight, while Izuku sleeps, he takes the briefcase. Pino vigorously shows her distaste for his action, but Rody chooses to ignore his bird companion's protests and goes off to secretly report to the police. Pino manages to wake up Izuku and take him to where Rody is.

Flect Turn proceeds to compare Rody to his father, both seeing the "bigger picture" to help their cause in order to protect their family.

  <p key="65ee1cc6-4d1f-41b5-bca3-801d83c4dc8c">
   Rody is about to give the disarming key to Flect Turn, however, Izuku sees Pino peeking out from behind his sweater. He then recalls the conversation they had a few days ago, in which Rody revealed that Pino is actually his Quirk, Soul, an extension of himself that shows his true intentions, and that even though he considers the Quirk embarrassing, Izuku says it is a great Quirk. Realizing it is a feint, on Pino's command, Rody flicks the deactivation key into the air, catching Flect Turn off guard, allowing Izuku to attack him, as Rody runs to the control room to defuse the bombs.

  <p key="8f05935e-eb88-4dcc-96d3-330403cb51db">
   Enraged for being fooled, Flect Turn reactivates the room's laser defenses to shoot at both of them. Rody manages to dodge some of the shots but in the end, he is fatally wounded by one of the lasers. Still, he continues to make his way to deactivate the bombs while Izuku keeps Flect Turn at bay. He increases the power of

   and attacks Flect Turn with volumes of kicks and punches to keep him at bay. Rody manages to get to the computer, but ends up passing out from blood loss before inserting the key.

  <p key="9c0b8341-8d22-4fb3-8c30-cdcc076220ed">
   Flect Turn mocks him for failing just like his father, which is replied by attacks from a raging Izuku, but this time, to the villain's surprise, he begins to budge with each blow, realizing a fact he thought was impossible: his Quirk actually has limits. This is pointed out by Izuku, who rubs salt into the wound by telling him that the only reason his life was full of sadness is because he gave up instead of believing in his own Quirk. Unable to accept he was wrong all this time, Flect Turn resorts to continue fighting him.
  </p>
  <p key="9d3b56a3-3cab-444f-a331-26cecb379613">
   Now both Izuku and Flect Turn are evenly matched, until Izuku eventually realizes that Flect Turn's reflecting Quirk cannot sustain too much damage, and every time it reflects an attack, Flect Turn loses stamina and the Reflect gets weaker. Pushing through with another barrage of kick attacks and powerful punches, Flect Turn starts to fall back even further.

   Inspired by everyone else all around the world still fighting their hardest even when things seem at its bleakest, Izuku vows to defeat Flect Turn and pushes himself beyond his limitation by activating
   One For All: Full Cowl - 100%
   , overloading the Reflect Quirk with a bombardment of super-fast punches that causes the Quirk to be stretched further beyond its limits until the Quirk releases its pent-up energy. Izuku finally knocks the villain out for good using the built-up energy to power his Super Move:

   After defeating the villain, Izuku runs downstairs to help Rody. He arrives at the control room to find that Rody is still alive, and that Pino had managed to insert the key in time, defusing all the bombs and saving the world. In the World Hero Association and in all the cities where the bombs were found, the heroes celebrate that the tragedy has been stopped. A semi-conscious Rody asks him if he has managed to protect his family, and Izuku replies he did, saying he is amazing. Rody then says that make him looks real cool, and both laughs.

Rody starts working as a bartender and continues to care for his siblings, as well as looking to pursue his dream of becoming a pilot.
