   All For One allows the user to steal the Quirks of other people and wield those stolen powers as their own. It also allows the user to redistribute stolen Quirks to someone else. The process of giving and taking away Quirks is done through touch, through a hole in the palm of the user's hand, once it receives contact.
  </p>
  <p key="a8597f40-881f-42ff-89e0-4a01df336da6">
   A victim whose Quirk has been stolen becomes

   , and loses any abnormal features if the powers happened to be Mutant-types. Interestingly, even if the user holds Mutant-type Quirks, the subsequent features do not permanently manifest on the user's body, and they can instead summon the mutant features at will. Additionally, when a Quirk is stolen, the victim becomes disoriented and immobile for a short time. Meanwhile, Quirkless people who receive a Quirk through All For One become capable of manifesting all of its attributes.

   Rarely, a Quirk granted by this ability can blend together with the recipient's original Quirk, creating an entirely new power, as shown with

   .
   In addition, it is also possible for the Quirks stored within All For One to evolve and grow stronger when mixed with other Quirks, as demonstrated with All For One's lie detection Quirk that he stole when Quirks first began.

  <p key="a16fab63-8af5-4d16-9294-b56b5d52ba61">
   All For One can be used to combine several Quirks in order to create devastating techniques, which would normally not be possible with the usage of only one Quirk.
   Furthermore, it can also be used to help restrict a Quirk’s drawbacks and weaknesses through the usage of other Quirks, allowing the user to easily handle multiple powers without facing repercussions to their body.

   All For One's first user intended to have Tomura inherit his Quirk, implying that transferring All For One itself to another person is possible.
   This was evinced to have already been accomplished, as All For One, prior to being sent to Tartarus, had Doctor

   Another facet of receiving this power is having a mental link with the previous user, whose psyche was imprinted onto the All For One Quirk. As a result, Tomura exhibits some of his master's personality traits, and can meet with a vestige of All For One within his own mind.
   This is similar to how the wills of the One For All users are integrated into One For All itself, which has evolved to where

   All For One seems to grant access to an unidentified mental realm contained within the Quirk similar to its counterpart Quirk, One For All, as shown when Tomura tried to steal One For All from Izuku. When this happened, the mental realms of both Quirks became connected temporarily and the current users, and the stored consciousness of previous users, were shown inhabiting the same mental realm.

   All For One is incapable of stealing One For All from its wielder, as that Quirk, by its very nature, can only be passed on if the present wielder wills it.
   Thus, wielders of One For All can act as a natural counter of sorts against All For One's ability to steal other Quirks. However, he was able to overcome this limitation in the past against previous wielders of One For All, due to the sheer number of Quirks he possessed. Furthermore, Kyudai performed various experiments on the body of Tomura so that the latter can be capable of stealing One For All, a feat All For One himself couldn't accomplish. It was eventually revealed that One For All's anti-theft properties can be overridden by someone with strong negative emotions, due to it eating away a potential inheritor's will. The vestiges of the previous One For All users surmised that All For One has been grooming Tomura's body and hatred in order to override One For All's will and finally steal it in that manner.
   This also means that the elder Shigaraki didn't have enough hatred to steal One For All on his own.
  </p>
  <p key="0fe14174-b05c-4b4f-b275-5b8592661019">
   It's been discussed by Kyudai that, over time, the large number of accumulated Quirks within All For One was becoming dangerous to the user himself. While it seemed that All For One could allow the user to safely control any number of Quirks, there is a limit to how much the user can control without it adversely affecting them, like the Nomu. Kyudai went on to state that if the "memory" (the amount of power of a Quirk) exceeds the "hardware" (the body of the Quirk user) then it will cause serious problems.
   This is somewhat similar to One for All, which causes a serious burden on the user's body and can shorten their lifespan if they already possess a Quirk when receiving it due to the burden of possessing multiple Quirks.

   As all Quirks are tied to their user's body and have been stated to be a function of the user's physiology much like an organ or limb, as such, injuries or negative health conditions will limit a user's Quirk or their ability to use it. This is even more pronounced with All For One, as the ability to use stolen Quirks along with how many Quirks can be stolen is directly connected to the health and strength of the user's body, the user's ability to steal Quirks and use them is drastically diminished if they become injured or crippled.

   The only way for an All For One user to rid themselves of a self-destructive Quirk is to transfer it to someone else, as demonstrated by "Tomura's" failed attempt to do so with New Order. Another possibility would be for the user to gain a Quirk that could heal or negate another Quirk's damaging affects, although this was impossible with New Order as the rule set upon it prevented it from coexisting with other Quirks.

   While not an issue for the original wielder of the Quirk, one particular weakness of All For One for an inheritor of the original Quirk variant is the threat of the previous wielder's will taking over the body and controlling the current user, as is the case for Tomura being taken over by All For One. As described by the vestigial will of All For One contained within the Quirk, negative emotions such as hatred and anger would allow his consciousness to take over the body of its current wielder, as well as shape the body into a whole new being, that is a fusion of the two minds.
