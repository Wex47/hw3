   The chapter begins in the U.A. Conference Room. The U.A. faculty is having a meeting about the League of Villains. Naomasa Tsukauchi informs the U.A. faculty that he could not find or obtain any information on the perpetrators who attacked the USJ the other day. All Might tells the U.A. faculty that the ringleader, Tomura Shigaraki, displayed a childlike mindset, which intrigues the U.A. faculty. Naomasa says that the villains they captured the other day all swore allegiance to Tomura and surmises that these villains may have been attracted by Tomura's childlike mindset due to being pressurized by the great amount of Heroes in this present age. Naomasa declares that he will be assisting the police in order to continue capturing more criminals. Before the meeting ends, Mr. Principal suggests that due to his childlike mindset, they could help Tomura grow but then supposes that it's naïve of him to think that way.

   In Class 1-A, Shota has announced to his students that the U.A. Sports Festival is approaching and encourages his students to use the special event to get noticed as the country's top pro heroes will be watching it. The students start getting pumped up for the event, especially Ochaco, who is noted to be uncharacteristically spirited.
  </p>
  <p key="352d60ef-156b-4dbe-a7bd-fd64002e8405">
   After the fourth period of Modern Literature ends, at noonday break, Ochaco, while walking with her friends Izuku and Tenya, tells them that she wants to become a Hero to earn money, though she admits that it is a selfish reason. However, Tenya says that becoming a hero to make a living isn't selfish at all. Ochaco decides to tell Izuku and Tenya about her family; her family works in the construction business, but due to there being no work her family is poor. A flashback occurs showing a young Ochaco asking her father to allow her to help in the family business but Ochaco's father refuses, saying that he wants Ochaco to make her own dreams come true. The flashback ends. Ochaco declares that she will become a hero and earn lots of money so that she can use the money to make the lives of her parents easier. Both Izuku and Tenya find Ochaco's goal to be admirable. All Might appears and asks Izuku to have lunch with him, to which Izuku complies.

   In the break room, both All Might and Izuku eat their lunch with All Might informing Izuku that his time limit has shortened to 50 minutes, to which Izuku apologizes, but All Might tells him to forget about it. When asked about One For All, Izuku tells All Might that he has gained a small amount of control over One For All when he had attacked Nomu at the USJ, which pleases All Might. All Might informs Izuku that his time as the Symbol of Peace is nearing the end, saddening Izuku. All Might says to Izuku that he wants Izuku to tell the world at the U.A. Sports Festival that he is the next generation's "All Might", shocking Izuku.
   However, Izuku is skeptical about fulfilling All Might's request. All Might tells Izuku to think about it and that he won't force Izuku to do it. He then asks Izuku not to forget how he felt at the Seaside Park.

   After school has finished, Class 1-A tries to leave their homeroom, but they find that the exit to the classroom is blocked and crowded by many students. Katsuki says that the other classes are scoping the class that was victorious against the villains the other day before the big event. Katsuki threatens the other classes to back away, but one of the students says that many students in the General Department like himself can be transferred to the Department of Heroics based on the results of the U.A. Sports Festival and that the reverse is also possible. The student then says to consider his talk as a declaration of war. A student from Class 1-B loudly says that he came to see the class that defeated villains and remarks on their arrogance. He then yells at Class 1-A to not embarrass them at the Sports Festival. Izuku starts to realize that many other people are striving to become great heroes and it's not just him who wants to become a great hero.

   Two weeks have passed and the day of the U.A. Sports Festival has finally arrived. Security has been beefed up heavily and the Sports Festival is being broadcast live. In the Class 1-A waiting room, just before they are about to head out, Shoto Todoroki approaches Izuku and states that he is stronger than Izuku, and also that he suspects he and All Might have a special connection and that because of this, he is determined to beat him. Izuku admits that Shoto is far stronger than him but says that everyone, including the students from the other departments, is giving it their all to aim for the top and declares to Shoto that he is going to give it his all as well, which intrigues Shoto.

   The other freshmen classes also walk out. The Chief Referee for the Freshmen Stage of U.A.'s Sports Festival, Midnight, asks for the player representative who is Katsuki Bakugo to come towards the stage.

   The Obstacle Race starts and Izuku finds trouble in securing a place in the race. Shoto Todoroki makes his move by freezing the ground causing dozens of students to become stuck in ice and skids himself into first place. However, all of Class 1-A avoid Shoto's ice. Shoto comments that he expected them to avoid his ice. Minoru tries to attack Shoto with his Quirk, but Minoru is knocked away by a Villain Robot. The first obstacle is revealed: lots of Villain Robots from the Entrance exam block the way. However, Shoto instantly freezes many Villain Robots with his ice, defeating them. The Villain Robots come crashing down, blocking the way for the other students while Shoto himself forges ahead, having gained a huge lead over the others.

  <p key="1ee40570-2793-481c-8735-601aace11123">
   Izuku is confronted by some Villain Robots, deciding that now is the time to put his head to use, no longer shaking in fear unlike in the Entrance Exam.
   Izuku dodges a robot's attack, then picks up a piece of metal and waits for the robot to approach him. As the robot gets momentum, Izuku slices its head off with the metal, not wanting to use his Quirk so early in the first phase. Izuku decides to keep the metal as a shield and runs ahead as the students (many from Class 1-A) start going past the Villain Robots onto the next obstacle.

   The Obstacle Race enters its second stage; The Fall, a canyon that must be trekked by walking on ropes. Meanwhile, Shoto who is in the lead has already finished trekking across The Fall and goes to the final obstacle: The Land Mine Field. Many students start crossing the Fall with Katsuki catching up to Shoto and Izuku nearly finished crossing it. The lead Shoto has starts diminishing due to him having to carefully cross the Land Mine Field. Katsuki, because he is unaffected by Explosions, blasts himself towards Shoto, thus gaining the lead. Shoto and Katsuki start having a brief scuffle for the lead.

   The Obstacle Race has entered its final stage with Izuku having reached the final stage. Realizing that the leaders in the race are too far away to catch up on foot, Izuku hatches an idea: he places himself onto the metal shield and detonates a land mine, causing him to blast himself into the lead.
   Katsuki and Shoto stop fighting one another and immediately run to catch up to Izuku and almost overtake him. However, as Izuku begins to lose momentum, he uses the metal sheet and slams it on the ground, setting off several mines and blowing dust into Katsuki and Shoto, forcing them to stop. Izuku runs ahead to the finish line and crosses it, placing first, much to All Might and Izuku's happiness. Shoto crosses the finish line, placing second and Katsuki crosses the finish line, placing third. Soon, the other students cross the finish line.

   Midnight states that the 42 students at the top have earned the right to advance while the other students fail to advance. Midnight announces the second event of the Sports Festival: The Cavalry Battle. The top 42 students each form a team of 2-4 for this event and earn points by grabbing headbands from the other teams. The number of points each student is worth is dependent on their placement in the Obstacle Race. However, Izuku, who placed 1st, is an exception to the points rule and is instead worth 10 million points, which horrifies Izuku.

  <p key="73527f8e-9dec-4411-9c7b-4d529075c1d9">
   Midnight explains that the time for the Cavalry Battle is 15 minutes and that the point value of each team will be the total accumulation of each of the headbands taken. Midnight says the one to wear the total point accumulated headband will be the rider. Midnight continues to explain that the headband can only be worn around the head or the neck, and that if a team crumbles or loses a headband, that team is not out of the game. Midnight says that Quirks can be used but cannot be used for malicious aim. Midnight orders the students to begin team negotiations and have 15 minutes to team up.

  <p key="e1ad3bd6-0230-4a9c-8e6b-f303924ceab9">
   The students begin teaming up, with Izuku having trouble finding a team due to the amount of points he is worth and the fact that nobody knows his Quirk. Ochaco approaches him and asks to team up with him, saying that she would rather team up with friends much to Izuku's joy. Izuku tries to get Tenya to join. However, Tenya, while stating that Izuku is a friend, also sees Izuku as a rival. Tenya says that he wants to improve himself and grow from his experience in facing against Izuku, thus Tenya joins Shoto's team which consists of Denki and Momo. The girl with gadgets from the Obstacle Race introduces herself as Mei Hatsume from the Department of Support and asks to join Izuku's team with Izuku impressed by Mei's support items. Izuku then ponders who his last teammate will be, looking for someone that can provide power. Izuku spots the teammate he's looking for.

   Katsuki's team (consisting of Eijiro, Hanta, and Mina) arrive and Hanta uses his tape to reel him into the formation. Katsuki's headband is suddenly swiped by a Class 1-B student called Neito. Neito explains that his class was observing Class 1-A during the Obstacle Race and used their observation to their advantage for the Cavalry Battle. Neito then insults Katsuki, telling him that it must be sad to be a villain's victim every year. Absolutely enraged, Katsuki tells Eijiro that they are changing plans; before they get to Izuku they plan to fight Neito first.

   After the Cavalry Battle ends, the Sports Festival takes a noonday break. Shoto takes Izuku aside to confront him as Izuku wonders what Shoto wants. Meanwhile, the number one hero, All Might, greets the number two hero, Endeavor. All Might states it has been a long time and invites him for tea.

  <p key="8feac2c2-0f3d-4ae5-aa27-5f96cd35ba14">
   Shoto says that Izuku made him broke his pledge; that he would never use his fire power. Izuku notes that his Fire Quirk would have helped and wonders why he didn't use it. After facing him in combat, Shoto notes how Izuku's Quirk is very similar to All Might's, which alarms Izuku. Luckily, Shoto only assumes that Izuku is All Might's illegitimate son, but Izuku denies that type of relation. After hearing this, Shoto concludes that Izuku still has some connection to All Might. He then says that Izuku should know about his father, Endeavor, who has been the number two hero forever, and if Izuku is connected to All Might, the number one hero, he has all the more reason to win against Izuku.

   Elsewhere, the two top heroes meet each other. All Might says that they have not spoken to each other in ten years and that he wanted to give him a shout out. Endeavor replies that he can take his tea offer to some other place and tells him to go away. As Endeavor leaves, All Might stops him, saying that his son Shoto was able to show a great performance even without using his full power. All Might then asks Endeavor for advice on how to raise the next generation. Endeavor then comments on All Might's attitude, finding it to be annoying and then says that he will make Shoto a hero that surpasses All Might, then angrily walks away.

  <p key="3e58c452-7ad4-4978-ab0a-ae9f850baeef">
   Shoto then explains his reason why he must win against Izuku: his father wanted to advance his position above All Might but could never do it with his own power and devised a plan; a
   Quirk Marriage
   that would allow him to conceive a child with an enhanced Quirk and raise that child to rise above All Might. Shoto spitefully says that he will never be the tool of scum like Endeavor. Shoto then goes on to explain some of his past; that his memories of his mother have always been about her crying and that she despised his left side and dumped boiling water on him, much to Izuku's shock and horror. Shoto explains that the reason he must beat Izuku (someone who is connected to All Might) is a personal triumph over his father, saying that he will become the number one hero without using his father's Quirk and that it would be his total disavowal of him. Shoto then walks away, saying that he will climb over him using only his ice powers. While Izuku sympathizes with him, he states that he cannot lose either because of everyone who had supported him up to this point and not wanting to let them down. Izuku takes Shoto's war declaration and echoes it; saying that he will beat him. As Shoto walks away, Katsuki can be seen hiding behind a wall, implying that he had heard their entire conversation, before he leaves himself.

   Before Midnight can commence the drawing to determine the pairing for the tournament event, Mashirao requests withdrawal from the event, saying that his participation in the Human Cavalry Battle was done by being manipulated and insinuates that it was because of Hitoshi's Quirk. Mashirao says that he understands that the tournament event is a rare opportunity and that walking away would be foolish, but while everyone was giving their best on their own he wasn't doing his best due to being manipulated. Toru and Mina try to persuade him to reconsider, but Mashirao replies that he is saving his dignity. Nirengeki Shoda from Class 1-B also requests to resign, feeling that he does not deserve to participate in the tournament event. Midnight, liking his reasoning for resignation, accepts Mashirao and Nirengeki's requests for withdrawal from the tournament event. Midnight then says that the open slots will be filled in by the team that placed fifth: Team Kendo, but Team Kendo decide to give the opportunity to Team Tetsutetsu, much to Tetsutetsu's happiness. Midnight then announces that Tetsutetsu and Ibara will be replacing Mashirao and Nirengeki. After the drawing takes place, Midnight then shows the pairings for the tournament event. Izuku sees that his opponent is Hitoshi Shinso. Hitoshi approaches Izuku, but Mashirao warns Izuku not to respond to him.

Izuku is angered by Hitoshi's insults and attacks him, telling him to take back his words, but Izuku mysteriously stops moving.
   Shota Aizawa and Present Mic talk a little bit about Hitoshi's history and about his Quirk. Hitoshi orders Izuku to go out of bounds. Izuku then turns around and starts to walk out of the arena. In his head, Izuku tries to stop himself but his body is moving on its own accord and is starting to lose consciousness. He then remembers that Mashirao told him about Hitoshi's Quirk before the match. Mashirao told him a strong bump could break the spell. He then goes on to tell Izuku to win the match for him.

   Suddenly, eight mysterious eyes pop out of the dark in front of Izuku. Izuku starts to freak out and wonders what is happening to his fingers. One For All starts to activate on Izuku's fingers by itself and breaks Hitoshi's spell with brute force. Hitoshi becomes confused by how he was able to break out of it. Izuku then remembers that All Might said One for All was passed down through the ages and hypothesizes that those people could be previous users of One For All.

   Hitoshi then tries to get Izuku to talk to him again by taunting, but Izuku remains silent, now knowing that answering Hitoshi will result in him being brainwashed by Hitoshi again. Hitoshi says that he was born with a Quirk unfit for combat and unwanted by society, telling Izuku that a combat Quirk user like him will never understand how he feels. However, while running towards Hitoshi, Izuku understands Hitoshi's situation as he himself was in a similar situation (he was born without a Quirk and thus he was also unfit for combat like Hitoshi) before he received One For All. Izuku reaches Hitoshi and begins pushing him out of the ring, but Hitoshi retaliates by punching Izuku in the face. Despite this, Izuku continues to push Hitoshi out of the ring. Hitoshi grabs Izuku's neck but Izuku counters by grabbing Hitoshi's arm and then throws Hitoshi over his shoulder, slamming Hitoshi hard into the ground and in the process, causes Hitoshi's feet to go out of bounds, which ends the battle. Izuku is declared the winner and advances to the second round.

The students of the General Department applaud Hitoshi's efforts while some people in the crowd comment on the usefulness of Hitoshi's Quirk against villains.

   In Recovery Girl's Office, Izuku has his minor injuries attended to. Izuku tells All Might about the mysterious figures he saw while being brainwashed. All Might says that he also saw something similar to what Izuku experienced in his younger days. All Might theorizes that what Izuku saw were the imprints of those who wielded One For All in the past. All Might remarks that instead of the imprints, it was Izuku's own willpower that activated One For All to help him break free of Hitoshi's brainwash. Izuku isn't satisfied with the explanation, but All Might tells Izuku not to dwell on it and tells him to go and watch the next match. After Izuku leaves, Chiyo comments to All Might that Izuku also saw him, to which All Might remarks that it's a good thing.

Shota criticizes the crowd for thinking that way, saying that Katsuki is on guard due to his opponent's strength. Ochaco, despite being battered and wounded from Katsuki's Explosion assault, thanks Katsuki for not letting his guard down as it allowed her to put her plan into motion; to create a meteor shower from all of the rubble utilizing the effects of her Quirk. Ochaco fires the meteor shower of rubble at Katsuki, planning to use the shower of rubble as a distraction so that she can attack him directly with her Quirk. However, Katsuki uses a huge Explosion, destroying Ochaco's meteor shower of rubble and knocking her back onto the ground at the same time. Ochaco attempts to drag herself back up to face Katsuki, however, Ochaco's heavy wounds finally take their toll, and Ochaco collapses onto the ground, unable to move.

   The battle starts with Izuku trying to strategize against Shoto. Shoto uses his Quirk Half-Cold Half-Hot and shoots pillars of ice towards Izuku on the ground. Izuku uses One For All on his middle finger and flicks it causing a shockwave of wind pressure that destroys Shoto's ice. Izuku then does the same thing again with his index finger to strike Shoto which hits him but Shoto creates ice behind him to prevent himself from being blown out of the ring. Shoto then uses his ice power on the ground and Izuku destroys the incoming ice using the wind pressure from his Quirk. Using the ice, Shoto creates a board of ice to get into the air. He then uses his ice power on the ground again, knocking Izuku back and in the process causes Izuku's foot to become trapped in the ice. Shoto starts to attack the defenseless, but Izuku creates another wind pressure that frees himself and knocks Shoto back. Shoto, noting that Izuku is in a critical position after seeing his broken fingers, decides to end the battle and launches another wave of ice. However, Izuku fires another wind pressure attack destroying the ice which shocks Shoto. Izuku criticizes Shoto for only using half his power to aim for the top and says that he hasn't even managed to injure him with that half power. Izuku clenches his broken right hand into a fist and yells at Shoto to fight him man to man. Angry, Shoto wonders what Izuku is planning.

However, as he gets close to Izuku, Shoto starts to experience the frostbite from using his ice power too much and his movements become sloppy, which stops him from evading properly. This causes Shoto to get hit in the stomach by Izuku's One For All enhanced punch, knocking Shoto down onto the floor and becoming slightly injured. However, Shoto gets back up and launches a wave of ice at Izuku but it is weaker than before. Izuku destroys the ice attack with a blast of wind pressure and knocks Shoto back. Shoto asks Izuku why he is going so far, to which Izuku replies that he wants to live up to his mentor's expectations and wants to become an awesome hero who can answer people with a smile. Shoto is hit by Izuku again who states that while he may never understand Shoto's circumstances and resolution, he thinks that becoming number one without using his full strength and doing it to disown someone is a joke which causes Shoto to tell Izuku to shut it.

After thanking Izuku to himself, Shoto uses his fire power to ignite the cold (generated by his wave of ice) to create a huge wind blast which, along with Izuku's wind pressure attack, creates a huge shock wave which blasts both of them back and destroys Cementoss' cement wall in the process. The shock wave is felt throughout the entire arena.

   After the shock wave subsides and the dust and smoke clears, Shoto is seen standing in the ring with a quarter of his shirt ripped off and without any injuries. Izuku, however, is standing out of bounds. Izuku finally succumbs to his grievous wounds and falls flat onto the ground. Shoto is declared the winner and thus Izuku is eliminated from the tournament event.

Even worse, Katsuki's fierce fighting style prevents Fumikage from countering. Despite this, Fumikage does manage to keep Katsuki at bay. Tired of his persistence, Katsuki manages to get past Fumikage's Dark Shadow and lands behind Fumikage. Katsuki uses Stun Grenade which causes an explosion around him, hitting Fumikage and his Dark Shadow in the process. After the smoke clears, Katsuki has Fumikage pinned down. Katsuki tells Fumikage that it's his fault for telling people about Dark Shadow's weakness but admits that it wasn't a fair matchup to begin with. Although he can still get up and fight, Fumikage, knowing he is at a severe disadvantage, surrenders. Fumikage's surrender causes Katsuki to win, thus the final match will be between Katsuki and Shoto.
