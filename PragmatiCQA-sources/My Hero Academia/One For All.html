   The fourth user, Hikage, believed that he would not be able to defeat All For One and decided to use his "turn" with One For All to seclude himself and train the Quirk to be as strong as possible. However after eighteen years, his body unexpectedly started to deteriorate. Though he blamed it on an unknown disease at the time, in reality, possessing One For All and his original Quirk had dramatically shortened his lifespan, forcing him to pass it on shortly before dying. All For One attempted to steal One For All twice, first from the fifth user, Daigoro, and then from the sixth, En, but had failed both times. This was apparently because he wasn't able to muster the rage to overcome the fragments of the wielders' consciousness.

   The seventh user, Nana, was the last holder killed by his hand, while her apprentice and heir to One For All, Toshinori, fought All For One at least twice, winning both battles, but suffering significant injuries in the process.

   , he continued fighting for another six years without picking a successor. This would take him to a total of 40 years as One For All's wielder. At some point later, while conducting research into the former wielders of One For All, he discovered Hikage's death. While he was far from sure about it at the time, Toshinori speculated that he'd been able to continue using One For All for so long because, unlike most of its other wielders, he was Quirkless.

   </a>
   in order to help him find a successor, he encounters Izuku, a Quirkless boy just like he was. Impressed with Izuku's drive to become a hero, and with his selfless spirit, he chooses him to become the ninth and current wielder. According to Yoichi, he might also be the last one. The Quirk was passed down through nine generations, growing stronger with the passage of time. Currently, One For All is one of the most powerful Quirks in existence; however, it proves very difficult to fully master, and thus its full capabilities haven't been revealed yet.
  </p>
  <p key="3f6c1c2e-6206-4627-839d-3bbee8670ca0">
   In order to steal One For All, All For One decided he needed someone with extreme malicious intent, powerful enough to overpower the will of the both the wielder and the other consciousnesses within One For All. For that purpose, he groomed

   and filled him with hatred. Then, All For One transplanted his original Quirk onto Tomura Shigaraki, and seized control of the younger villain. Using Tomura Shigaraki's will, All For One attempted to steal One For All from Izuku, but was thwarted by Yoichi and Nana. Believing that Tomura's body was still incomplete, All For One retreated and began the completion.

  </h2>
  <p key="7587bf2f-0501-404f-af60-5e5c0fa04bab">
   One For All is a transferable Quirk that can be passed on from one user to the next.
   Its name comes from its nature; being 'one' Quirk for 'all' people. In order for the Quirk to be transferred, the recipient must ingest a sample of the predecessor's DNA (ex. a strand of hair or a drop of blood).
  </p>
  <p key="5194b5cd-5a79-4b09-86a3-326ea464c217">
   The origin of One For All is itself a powerful will that refused to submit to All For One. For this reason, One For All cannot be stolen by any means. In order for the Quirk to be transferred, the current owner must freely choose to transfer it. However, it can be forcibly given, as the recipient doesn't have to agree to anything. Since One For All can't be forcibly taken, it is one of the only Quirks that can be used in combat against All For One, as any user of All For One would simply be able to steal most other Quirks.
  </p>
  <p key="a29bf32e-0767-4733-89a8-35511585c147">
   One For All also allows the user to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, allowing them to significantly enhance all of their physical abilities to a superhuman level. This results in unbelievable levels of strength, speed, agility, and durability.
  </p>
  <p key="cb2e9756-d9e7-4996-87fa-2eb3ed4fb7f5">
   The user can focus the stockpiled power into a single body part, or spread the power evenly throughout their body, although, focusing the power puts a greater strain on the part of the body where the power is focused. The user is also able to control the percentage of the power that they activate. One For All can even grant the user an exceptional strength boost to their given Quirk if they have one.
  </p>
  <p key="00c2fa9e-47e4-441d-9f43-aff085899a87">
   The core of One For All has grown in strength from being passed from user to user, and the Quirk Factors of all of the previous users have merged into the core. The current user, Izuku Midoriya, has the exclusive ability to access the Quirks of previous One For All users. The Quirks have significantly increased in strength since they were used by their original users; this is due to the nature of One For All's core stockpiling power and increasing in strength from user to user.
  </p>
  <p key="2f226a1a-f9b8-4e1a-808e-30c5f7ded9a8">
   In addition to the Quirk Factors merging with the core, One For All carries echoes of the consciousnesses of all of the previous users. One For All has some kind of subconscious realm where the previous users can manifest. It is later revealed that this is due to the fact that Quirks are engraved with the consciousnesses of their users, so any new user who receives One For All has their consciousness embedded into the subconscious realm.
   It was originally believed that the consciousnesses can only be embedded into One For All if the user possesses a Quirk, however Toshinori proved this to be false: since he didn't have a Quirk or a Quirk Factor to have his consciousness copied into, Toshinori instead was able to actually imbue a true piece of his consciousness inside of One For All. This allows the fragment of consciousness to fully interact with the other users and share with them everything the real Toshinori knows, which is how the other vestiges were able to learn about the life shortening side-effect of One For All.
  </p>
  <p key="7bc21fca-a161-4d36-9a18-90aa77352001">
   The subconscious realm within One For All was originally a barren landscape surrounded by darkness, and vestiges of the previous holders could only share brief visions with one another. However, after Tomura and All For One attempted to steal One For All, they drew the vestiges out by sheer force, stabilizing the vestiges within and allowing the current and previous users of One For All to communicate with each other freely. The realm took the form of the ruins of a conference room with chairs, one for each holder, though the second and third users initially choose not to sit and stand in the corner with their backs turned. After having been stabilized, the previous users can now fully interact with Izuku whenever they wish, giving him advice on their Quirks and how to best use them.
   The realm also seems to have some connection to One For All's counterpart Quirk, All For One.
   The One For All realm appears to be the room where Yoichi first met his eventual successors, the second and third users of One For All, the very room where the stockpiling Quirk was forced on him and fused to Yoichi's transference Quirk to create One For All itself. All For One's failed attempt to steal One For All from Izuku removed all communication barriers between him and his predecessors. Now Izuku can freely manifest the spirits of past One For All users while remaining conscious.

   One For All also seems to alter the user's appearance in different ways. For All Might, it significantly enlarges his muscles and overall body mass to make him look like a completely different person, similar to a giant. For Izuku, usage of One For All causes the empowered part of his body to glow, with vein-like lines crossing through each other. His body also generates crackling, green energy that resembles lightning bolts when he activates

  </h3>
  <p key="853121aa-1fe1-401a-8f3e-e7d96e3e4f20">
   When One For All is transferred, the new user's body is not naturally suited to it as they normally would be with a Quirk they were born with (ex. Someone who breathes fire doesn't burn their mouth while using their ability). In addition, One For All is a lot to handle; if one's body can't handle the power, then their body could be blown apart. Because of this, the successor must undergo intense and rigorous physical training.
  </p>
  <p key="6c99642c-4740-4ea4-b5fb-9a4cd97fecb6">
   Even after inheriting the Quirk, it takes time for the new user to adjust to One For All and learn how to properly control it. While Izuku Midoriya trained his body into a suitable vessel for the Quirk, it was rushed to a period of ten months for him to be ready for U.A. High School’s Entrance Exams. Using the Quirk while inexperienced can easily lead to self-injury, most notably with Izuku, who could only use it in short blasts of power which would break his limbs as a result. Only when Izuku learned to channel One For All’s power evenly
   <a href="One For All Full Cowl.html" key="db1352a9-1fb8-44f9-8f2a-6a1c51b75986" title="One For All: Full Cowl">
    throughout his whole body
   </a>
   was he able to stop this self-injurious habit and begin honing the Quirk’s power as his own. Even so, repeatedly damaging his body led to extreme consequences, such as the ligaments in his arms becoming frailer, to the point where he now risks losing total function of them should he continue to use One For All recklessly.
  </p>
  <p key="5b842137-0667-44ae-ae78-89266e85f475">
   After One For All is transferred, the previous user is left with only residual power from the Quirk (or "leftover embers"). While they would still be able to utilize the power to essentially the same degree as before, continuous usage of it will cause their power output to decrease, until the wielder is not able to make tangible use of the Quirk at all. After All Might's final battle against All For One, his ability to sustain his Muscular Form was reduced to seconds, rending him unable to make any use of his residual power.
  </p>
  <p key="0c19aff2-3c28-4972-b1ca-f1a56bf5c076">
   Like with all Quirks, the ability to use One For All is strongly tied to the user's physical health and wellbeing. As such, they will find it harder to handle the Quirk's raw power should they face negative health issues, even if they were strong and physically conditioned enough to inherit it. Examples here include Yoichi Shigaraki, who could not make proper use of One For All due to his weak body and sickly state, despite being the Quirk's original owner. Another example is with All Might who gained permanent, debilitating injuries following his first battle with All For One, limiting his ability to keep his empowered form active to only a few hours a day and thus hindering the use of his Quirk. As mentioned above, after passing One For All on to Izuku Midoriya, this time frame continued to deplete rapidly.
  </p>
  <p key="352cf347-b66b-4958-b64e-7ea408cd6e2e">
   Following the research conducted by All Might, as well as the discourse of the One For All vestiges, it is revealed that One For All can affect the user's lifespan. If a person who already has a Quirk receives One For All, the extra Quirk places an enormous burden on their body, depleting the user's life force and shortening their lifespan. It is analogous to adding water to an already-full cup, causing it to overflow and breakdown. The rate at which the person's life decays is unknown, but Hikage, the fourth user, received One For All at the age of twenty-two and died of "old age" eighteen years later, at the age of forty. This weakness can be circumvented if an inheritor does not already have a Quirk, since the Quirkless user would be an "empty cup" that is filled by One For All. However, this weakness has become more of a concern due to the number of people born Quirkless becoming fewer and fewer, as well as One For All continuing to rise in power, thus limiting potential successors who can handle the Quirk safely.
  </p>
  <p key="ed93a8e6-8a9a-465d-b674-245833c8dacc">
   While One For All cannot be stolen by any means, the users do admit that, theoretically, it is possible for All For One to steal One For All, provided he is able to overwhelm the collective will of all its users. Yoichi speculates that as the reason why All For One raised Tomura Shigaraki to have such overwhelming rage and hatred, as it would be able to eat away at the willpower of all the users and therefore bypass One For All's immunity to be stolen.
  </p>
  <p key="6e485f62-b5e3-4ce0-ac83-1255aab6015f">
   When manifesting themselves in the unconscious realm of One For All, the current user's body is not all there at first. Some parts, such as their mouth, take time to learn how to fully manifest, making it more difficult to communicate with the other vestiges. This weakness was inadvertently removed by All For One when he unsuccessfully attempted to steal One For All from Izuku. Consequently, there are no communication impediments between the One For All users.

   The Quirk Factors of each of the previous users have merged with the core of One For All and have since increased in strength due to One For All's nature of stockpiling power. Izuku is the first user capable of accessing the Quirks of the previous users. Because All For One would constantly hunt and steal the most powerful Quirks, most of the user's Quirks are rather unexceptional by themselves and do not have enough potential to be raised to
