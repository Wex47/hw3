   Endeavor, while pursuing Tomura, is confused by Deku.

Endeavor is about to tell him he doesn't have time for that, when suddenly Tomura lands on the ground to locate Deku's position at that moment. Endeavor attacks him with a blast of fire. However, Tomura dodges and changes his direction. Endeavor tells Deku that he is heading southwest, and Deku says he will buy time for evacuation before hanging up.

Before Tomura can attack the flame hero, Gran Torino quickly pounces on him, smashing his head into the ground. Tomura swings at Torino but misses when the veteran hero jumps back.

  </p>
  <p key="045e55e1-95b8-4ee5-a5ca-cefb45c517bf">
   On the ground, everyone is stunned by Deku's display of power, but Bakugo, who knows about One For All and knows Deku's limits better than anyone, claims that he won't be able to continue fighting like this for long, especially against someone who can regenerate. Much to everyone's horror, he states in that battle of endurance, Deku will lose in a few minutes, and the result will be that Tomura stealing his Quirk.
  </p>
  <p key="08edf7fb-46d0-4f11-b94a-283b70ef551a">
   Knowing this, Bakugo tells Endeavor and Shoto his plan: Endeavor has to hold off his flames until he gets him up in the air and Shoto to cool his father off for as long as possible. They both agree to do it, as Rock Lock starts to worry if their plan will work. But the minute Shoto tells him to take care of their teacher, he remembers he already acknowledged the children as Heroes. All three of them fly into the air.
  </p>
  <p key="5fb017e8-0bdf-4fd5-90c4-a8dd6e3e5d01">
   Endeavor then tells Bakugo to aim for when Blackwhip is completely extended and when he gets up there, the two need to get back to the ground or they may get caught in the blast. When the conditions required by Endeavor are met, Bakugo and Shoto launch Endeavor at the villain. Endeavor charges in and holds Tomura, yelling for Deku to get away as he incinerates Tomura with a point-blank Prominence Burn.
  </p>
  <p key="91bd02fa-9a8b-4e08-964a-cad84bce292f">
   While Tomura is burning alive and is on the verge of death, a vision of All For One reappears in his mind and tells Tomura to lend his body in order to help him. Tomura seemingly relents because in the next instant, he activates Rivet Stab to impale Endeavor with black tendrils emitting from his back, injuring him enough for him to let him go and fall again. As he falls, Endeavor can't believe he's still alive. The charred Tomura says something unintelligible before firing the wires at Deku, calling him his 'little brother'.
  </p>
  <p key="c318ddc2-e621-4766-9463-194ad53b492e">
   In that moment, completely parallel to what happened back in middle school, Bakugo, without even thinking, pushes Deku out of the way and receives the full force of the attack.
  </p>
  <p key="2e2a10c0-61e4-41df-a2f3-cdba213a4e80">
   Bakugo tells Deku to stop trying to win this own his own. Meanwhile "Tomura", says to someone else to "cut it out" as he releases him from the black wires. Deku watches in shock as Bakugo falls to the ground badly injured, being caught by Shoto after he grabbed his father. Speaking through Tomura, All For One mocks the sacrifice of the heroes and especially Bakugo's, which snaps Deku, feeling

    a strange and painful sensation in his head
   </a>
   . Blinded by rage, Deku attacks "Tomura", destroying the tendrils on his way, telling him to take back what he said.
  </p>
  <p key="54c3ac00-a9a5-4bd4-8b99-a40a8bbc76e7">
   Tomura is shocked at Deku's wrath, but within him, All For one is delighted, as Deku’s anger leaves him open to being touched by his enemy. "Tomura" takes the opportunity and puts his hand on Deku's face and proceeds to extract One For All. But all does not go as planned, as the move brings Deku and his foe into his mindscape. There Deku sees the vestige of All For One trying to merge with Tomura, who tries to reject him. Seeing this, Deku tries to move but falls. The vestige of Nana Shimura appears to help Deku.
  </p>
  <p key="3c344902-5b33-4dba-a514-b0038cf9ede5">
   When he notices Nana, All For One mocks her while introducing her to Tomura. Then, All For One begins to explain about the consciousness embedded in Quirks and his ability to interact with those consciousnesses. Nana tries to talk to her grandson, but he tells her that he hates her too, and unleashes a wave of Decay against her and Deku while his master applauds him. Enraged by his interference, Tomura attempts to destroy All For One too.
  </p>
  <p key="4bddd6d6-f7db-413a-b62d-e49bca400c60">
   Suddenly, the first One For All user appears and stops the eroding. All For One teases his little brother's stating that Deku is an unworthy successor, and combines his powers with Tomura’s to take One For All. The First Holder rebukes his brother's statement, with Nana Shimura protecting him. They fight one another in a tug of war generating a grand explosion.
  </p>
  <p key="52692500-482c-4388-96cd-5c06ed72404a">
   Deku wakes up from the dream as he and Tomura fall away from one another in the sky. Deku realizes they failed to steal One For All. Inside the unconscious Tomura's mind, All For One claims that it was due to his body not being fully adapted to his new Quirk. He tells him that his body needs to reach perfection and to retreat, while Deku pleads with Tomura to stop moving.
  </p>
  <p key="3e540637-d8cc-4d4c-893a-1fe39600b41f">
   Shoto catches Deku with his back, while still carrying his father and holding Bakugo's leg. They land pretty roughly but, to Shoto’s relief, the three of them are still alive. Then Shoto tells them that he is going to tend to their injuries. To their horror, just as he is about to administer first aid, Shoto, Deku and Endeavor see that Tomura is still active, using his Rivet Stab Quirk to produce numerous tendrils from his hands and back to be able to move. Within the villain, there is there is a clash of wills as All For One tells him to retreat but Tomura refuses to follow his instructions.

  <p key="047a1e8c-969e-4d4e-921c-fdfc2cd71a07">
   Suddenly, he gets blasted by Nejire Chan's
   Wave Motion
   as Ingenium runs to Shoto reporting that Gigantomachia is making his way to their current location. Manual and Rock Lock are moving the wounded Eraser Head, Gran Torino and Ryukyu are moved away from the battlefield. The former is so surprised to see Tenya there that can't help but call out his name. This draws Nejire's attention, who, upon seeing her mentor so beaten-up, glares angrily at Tomura.
  </p>
  <p key="49f35a28-e3d1-44c9-ac2a-a9b4b3136aae">
   Shoto tells Ingenium to get Deku and the others out of the there, but Deku orders him to focus their efforts on helping Bakugo and Endeavor, as he needs to stay close to Tomura because he is still after his Quirk. Shoto notices that Tomura is weakened after so much fighting, and states that him and Nejire can take him down. Tomura doesn't hide his displeasure after seeing that more maggots have appeared to face him, before resuming the confrontation.
  </p>
  <p key="dd66f1de-b4ce-40f8-984b-e94f4f6a062f">
   Shoto and Nejire attack Tomura while avoiding his black tendrils, but in the distance, the imposing figure of Gigantomachia finally comes closer and closer to aid his master in battle, having passed through several cities and defeated all that tried to stop him.
   All For One is glad for Gigantomachia’s timing, as Tomura is on the brink of collapse from the injuries sustained during the previous fight against Deku and Endeavor, despite having activated Rivet Stab from Tomura's spinal cord with auto tracking to reduce the burden placed on his body and mind. Now all he needs to do is order Gigantomachia to force retreat.
  </p>
  <p key="4ece5782-f247-493a-80e2-8a91ca3753ac">
   Shoto also notices the behemoth is coming, and is aware that there is no way for Nejire and him to fight both Gigantomachia and Tomura simultaneously, so he decides that the best option is to defeat Tomura as soon as possible since he's already on his last legs. Both he and Nejire decide to attack Tomura at the same time with their respective super moves. Shoto unleashes a Jet Kindling attack in conjunction with Nejire's Nejire Flood at 100% output. Both attacks strike Tomura at the same time. It looks like he's finally going to be defeated, but then Endeavor yells at the students to run.
  </p>
  <p key="8f73f0e5-e421-46bb-b838-1cad63835f5a">
   Gigantomachia has finally arrived, swatting them aside with his giant hand in order to save his master.

   Although he does not hit anyone, Gigantomachia's attack is so powerful that the others try to protect themselves as best they can from the calamity he generates. Ingenium walks away with Bakugo in his arms, yelling at Shoto and Nejire Chan in worry. At that moment Bakugo regains consciousness and weakly tells him to put him down. He tells him that he can’t because of how injured he is but Bakugo insists on achieving a perfect victory.

   Gigantomachia brings the now unconscious Tomura close to his back while awaiting his next order, placing him on his back where

   tries to tend him. Endeavor managed to move Deku away and approached his son to help him. Endeavor internally apologizes to Hawks for Gigantomachia being allowed to move at all. However, as Japan's top hero, despite being seriously injured and not knowing any weaknesses his enemy might have, Endeavor is willing to give his life to take down Gigantomachia.

   emerges from the giant villain’s back, announcing his arrival to Endeavor on the ground, pleasantly realizing that Shoto is also there. Endeavor angrily calls out Dabi's name, but the villain states thats no way to address him, after all, he has a great name. As he washes off the black coloration on his white hair. Dabi then reveals that his true identity is that of Toya Todoroki.

   His proclamation shocked everyone but not as much as Endeavor and Shoto, who are horrified to their very core.
