   Katsuki and Izuku were playmates during their early childhood. Katsuki was shown to be athletically skilled, even before he manifested his quirk, and often received praise from others, including Izuku. Once Katsuki learned Izuku didn't have a Quirk while he himself manifested a powerful one, he felt that he had justification to look down on Izuku and had started considering him as a hindrance in his path to becoming the greatest hero. Katsuki felt like Izuku was supposed to be beneath him, but couldn't help but feel that Izuku was actually far above him due to his natural heroic personality. Katsuki could not accept this and did his best to keep Izuku at arms length, bullying Izuku alongside his classmates and giving him the derogatory name "Deku" which he always calls him. However, despite fearing Katsuki, Izuku still considered him a good friend and always refers to him as "Kacchan".
  </p>
  <p key="b6307084-abd4-4806-aa8d-8c97a01fc591">
   In their adolescence, Katsuki continued to bully Izuku, even burning one of his notebooks upon learning he was going to the same high school. However, he was surprised when Izuku ran into danger to save him from the

   inspiring All Might to take action in spite of his time limit. Katsuki caught up with Izuku and berated him for his actions, calling him a

   </a>
   failure most likely out of pride since he acknowledges he owed him. At U.A., Katsuki still looked down on Izuku, but was shocked to see that Izuku has developed a powerful Quirk. This sight convinced him that Izuku was "hiding this power from him". He nearly attacked him for answers before he was restrained by Shota Aizawa. As he felt superior to Izuku, he overlooked Izuku's intelligence and ingenuity both of which Izuku used along with his Quirk to finally stand up to Katsuki in their mock battle. Due to this, Katsuki's ego caused him to believe Izuku was making fun of him, even believing in one instance Izuku taunted him such as when Izuku tried to help him after Katsuki fell into a river. Katsuki attacked and insulted Izuku, demanding he use his Quirk in their fight. When Izuku finally used his Quirk against him, Katsuki was ready to prove himself only to realize Izuku had another plan and defeated him for the first time.

  <p key="c4768d97-2d1f-4b8f-8c0f-e9d1b5becbef">
   After his loss to Izuku in the Battle Trial, Katsuki was in disbelief. His defeat, along with witnessing how talented the rest of his class was in comparison to himself left him frustrated. Afterward, Izuku made an out-of-nowhere confession of possessing a borrowed Quirk which Katsuki seemingly did not believe. During that encounter, Izuku swore to beat him. He has always shown hostility towards Izuku whenever he interacts with him. Izuku's presence always irritating him and even shouting at him for no reason. At the end of the

   </a>
   , Katsuki's antagonism towards Izuku only intensified after seeing Izuku improve on his use of his Quirk as well as using his moves to help.
   When teamed up with Izuku, Katsuki ignored whatever he suggested and went as far as to attack him for trying to help him and stated that he doesn't need his help. However, after Katsuki stated to All Might he would rather lose than accept help from others, an irritated Izuku (surprisingly) punched him in the face stating he's not the type to just give up like that. Though reluctant, Katsuki got the message and finally worked together with Izuku and willingly protected him from All Might so he could get to the finish line.

  <p key="97d78dc7-0bd4-4962-96bc-5f979d9a9041">
   However, as pointed out by All Might and Ochaco, Katsuki is actually jealous of Izuku's growth and the potential to become stronger than him. He is also jealous of Izuku's popularity with the rest of the class. Katsuki, however furiously denies such statements. His second fight with Izuku, however, would prove that these statements are indeed true, and that Katsuki would begrudgingly acknowledge he's been jealous of Izuku's quick growth.

   and correctly deduced Izuku's Quirk was given to him by All Might. After Izuku confirmed it, Katsuki attacked Izuku, proclaiming they were going to fight since he wanted to see his potential.
   Despite growing up together and idolizing the same person, Katsuki did not understand why All Might chose Izuku over himself. Izuku realized while they fought that even if the fight seemed meaningless on its own, Katsuki needed it. During their encounter, Katsuki confides in Izuku that he blamed his needing to be rescued as the reason for All Might's early retirement.
  </p>
  <p key="687728f8-509c-4f79-a1dd-0a0e6c4ea27c">
   After the fight, All Might explained to Katsuki about his power, allowing the latter to become one of the few to know the truth of Izuku's Quirk. With this, it seems that, no matter how much he hates it, Katsuki does at least acknowledge Izuku's abilities. Katsuki seems to at least respect Izuku as a fighter and a rival, going as far as to point out a weakness of the latter's Shoot Style.

  <p key="411a02f3-abe8-4002-a845-8864e0479484">
   Interestingly, despite his malice towards Izuku, Katsuki has on two occasions expressed his true feelings in front of him. Once, after admitting defeat to Izuku and his realization of how 'powerful' he truly was at U.A. and the second occasion when he confessed his anguish towards All Might's current state. Katsuki learns to see just how fearful he is of Izuku's rapid development and how much they could accomplish if they were to work together, and from there, he begins to openly express more respect towards Izuku. Although he still sees him as a rival, he has been somewhat less aggressive towards him than before after their fight.

   Unbeknownst to him or Katsuki, Shota has seen their bond having a big effect on the rest of the Class 1A despite that they are not leaders or the most popular. Izuku and Katsuki's passion inspire everyone in the class and raises the standard for success.

  <p key="915b4f86-2560-4b70-9866-cab53db8b675">
   Katsuki now works with Izuku and is less malicious towards him. He willingly fought alongside Izuku who temporarily gave him One for All. And when Izuku temporarily thought that it was going to be the end of his dream, and that he was going to become Quirkless again. Together, they were able to defeat Nine. In the end, both of them talked to each other and were smiling, showing that their fierce rivalry is gradually becoming more friendly.

   As the fight progresses on, it becomes clear that Katsuki is trying to protect Izuku from Tomura, because when Izuku separates himself from the rest of the group to take on Tomura himself, Katsuki attempts to convince him to get away from Tomura, and shows panic when Izuku refuses. It's then revealed in a flashback that Katsuki had previously opened up to All Might about how he regrets his cruel treatment towards Izuku in their past and acknowledges that he bullied Izuku as an outlet for his own insecurities and weakness, with All Might correctly deducing that his current actions in assisting Izuku in learning to hone his Quirks is part of his atonement. This reveals that deep down, Katsuki truly feels remorse for bullying Izuku and is now attempting to make amends with him. After said flashback ends, Katsuki immediately rushes towards Izuku while he's fighting Tomura, going as far as to telling Endeavor that his next attack should be worth it.
   Then, as Izuku continues to fight Tomura despite breaking his arms multiple times, Katsuki goes up to help Izuku, and when Tomura attacks Izuku with his Rivet Stab, as he describes it, Katsuki's body moves on its own to save Izuku, getting himself stabbed.
   After the battle, he expressed great distress when Izuku did not awake, resulting in his classmates carrying him off.

   Although Katsuki at first didn't give Eijiro much attention, he seems to appreciate their Quirks' compatibility with each other, as he accepted Eijiro's proposal to form a team during the Human Cavalry Battle after smiling at his plan to take down Izuku. However, at the beginning of the Sports Festival, Katsuki called Eijiro "Hedgehog Hair" (despite having spiky hair himself which got pointed out to him), which irritated Eijiro. Katsuki later called Eijiro by his last name, showing he has come to respect or acknowledge him. This is seen again after their battle, where he is impressed by him holding his own before defeating him.

   Their relationship better improves as the series progresses, and, overall, Katsuki gets along with Eijiro. As such, Eijiro is the only person in Class 1-A Katsuki actually respects and would possibly go as far as being called a friend. This can be seen as Eijiro went to Katsuki for studying for the midterms since the latter scored higher than him. As noted by Izuku, Eijiro is the only one in their class who can call out to help Katsuki without hurting Katsuki's pride, which was proven true as Katsuki didn't hesitate to grab his hand when he was rescued.

Despite hearing Shoto's tragic backstory, Katsuki showed no sympathy towards him, although his statement about not caring about Shoto's problems or feelings could also be taken to mean he wanted the two of them to be able to fight without being held back by anything.

After their battle in the Sports Festival, Katsuki despised Shoto for not giving him a battle worthy enough of being called Number 1. Katsuki's anger caused him to grab an unconscious Shoto to continue, only to be fully restrained during the closing ceremony of the Sports Festival so he wouldn't release his fury onto Shoto.

He acknowledged her effort and remarks that he should've known she'd try it since he recalled her friendship with Izuku, indicating that Ochaco reminds him of Izuku, and wrongly assumed that she had help from him, until Izuku told Katsuki she fought him with her own strategy.

When his classmates (but Izuku) scolded him for fighting so hard at Ochaco saying that she is frail, Katsuki went out of his way saying, that he definitely wouldn't call Ochaco frail, while defending himself for fighting her at full strength.

   Their interactions start hostile, as Hanta once mentioned that nobody would actually vote for Katsuki as class representative, which annoyed Katsuki. Like Denki Kaminari and Ejiro Kirishima, he seems to get a kick out of poking fun at Katsuki and attempting to get a rise out of him, and is often successful. This was seen when he and Eijiro laughed at Katsuki's haircut by Best Jeanist and his punishment from his fight with Izuku.

He was also angry and embarrassed that he had to be saved by All Might when he was kidnapped and even refused to thank him. Despite his antagonistic attitude towards his former idol, Katsuki did show concern when All For One attacked him, showing that he at least somewhat care for him.

   Katsuki first met Tomura in the U.S.J. Arc. He was nearly attacked by the villain before All Might appeared. During the Final Exams Arc, Katsuki learned the League of Villains made plans to procure him, which was successful.

   Tomura then offered him a place in his organization since they both want to do what they want, but Katsuki refused as he voiced his admiration to All Might and was intent on being a hero. Katsuki even attacked Tomura and stood defiant at the latter's possible retaliation. In the end, Katsuki was rescued by his classmates and likely considers Tomura an enemy.

  <p key="e0382635-6fa6-405a-85ed-cf99e2a36464">
   They meet again during Paranormal Liberation War Arc, where Katsuki says that Deku is only a bait and Katsuki wants to get revenge on Tomura.

   Katsuki and Seiji display a mutual dislike for each other and they are polar opposites in regards to becoming heroes. Katsuki constantly ridicules Seiji's formal attitude by mockingly calling him “Senpai” while taunting Seiji about his name and the size of his eyes. In return, Seiji believes Katsuki is vulgar and undeserving of becoming a hero.
  </p>
  <p key="795bb73f-ec4a-42ad-be51-b607c077edba">
   At one point, Katsuki becomes victim to Seiji's Quirk and the latter prepares to eliminate him from the exams, but Denki defeats him after Katsuki anticipated his own defeat. As a result, Seiji is eliminated instead. In the end, neither got their provisional licenses and had to take remedial lessons.

  <p key="fdf0579b-a69b-42d9-84ca-d20f236b99e2">
   Even after the Provisional Hero License Exam, Seiji and Katsuki do not get along at all and were not pleased to see the other in the remedial lessons. Katsuki tends to call Seiji "Meat", referring to Seiji's Quirk.

   Katsuki met Camie during the Gang Orca trial. Camie does not seem to mind Katsuki's aggressive attitude and she is not afraid to tell him that his methods to win children's hearts are outdated, which bothers him greatly. Even so, she manages to make Katsuki laugh by using her Quirk to make an illusion of Shoto. After the trial, she said that he seems pretty well mannered when he keeps quiet, to which he reacted by telling her to shut up.

   In their first meeting, Katsuki could easily see through Yo's nice façade and outright told him that he found him fake and aggravating, causing Yo to smirk in amusement.

   The two later came to blows in the Provisional Hero License Exam but didn't interact that much after their first encounter.
