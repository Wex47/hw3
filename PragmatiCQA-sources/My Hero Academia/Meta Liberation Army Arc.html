    villains

   On their way back from their final provisional license training, Shoto and Katsuki notice the commotion as they ride past in a car with All Might. Since there are no heroes around, the two students decide to take charge of the thieves. All Might tries to dissuade them since they've only just earned their provisional licenses, but they pay no heed and attack the villains nonetheless, making use of their new privileges.

The leader proceeds to explain that his group had studied the area's patrol patterns in preparation for their robbery and that they are determined to not be stopped by high school students.
  </p>
  <p key="d95e601f-96e6-4732-a6f2-6ad26080fdcf">
   The leader calls for his gang to run away. Katsuki is able to KO several of the gang members as they flee. The leader is shocked by Katsuki's capabilities. However, he is able to fend off Katsuki by using high powered jets of carbonated liquid from his gauntlets. The leader notes that his gauntlets are too strong. He slips and falls from the blowback sending a stream of carbonate crashing into a light pole. An astonished bystander tries to take a picture of the snowy scene as the light pole falls down causing All Might to save her. Katsuki blows up the light pole so that it doesn't hit the bystander and All Might. Katsuki reprimands the woman for her careless actions.

  <p key="db413707-fe31-4d3a-9a43-5e7a3b49b281">
   Shoto notes that the leader and his gauntlets are becoming too much and decides to unleash his full power. Shoto uses his

Amazed by their capabilities he praises and hugs the two, saying they will make top heroes one day. The gauntlet of the leader's mysteriously explodes and disintegrates causing Katsuki to be alarmed. Slidin' Go notes that it's to be expected from inferior black market products. All Might congratulates the duo for a doing a great job before departing.

   , appears, reminding his viewers that the rise of Quirks caused changes in the manufacturing industry as making mass items became obsolete since there would be people with very varying body types including multiple limbs, anthropomorphic animals, people made of different matter than just flesh, etc. From this chaotic situation the Detnerat Company emerged, specialized in by making individually tailored items for whoever needed them. And the Detnerat president announces that now the company will also be dedicated to manufacturing support items for heroes.

  <p key="a36973c3-9f52-4f40-a031-b5ee2e4fe97a">
   Once the commercial is over, the scene is set in the office of Rikiya, who is talking to his employee
   Miyashita
   about the commercial. Rikiya of bemoans about how large his forehead looks in it. Miyashita jokes about it, making the president laugh. Rikiya discuss the company's prospects in the hero support market, and Miyashita notes that the company has a lot to overcome due to their newness in the market.

  </p>
  <p key="6314bd72-2000-4f8b-8517-2decf082a487">
   Without warning, Rikiya wraps his arms around Miyashita's body and begins to question him on his family. Miyashita answers that his mother is deceased as his boss starts to squeeze on his neck. As he squeezes, he tells Miyashita that he is disappointed with his view and had considered introducing him to the members of the Meta Liberation Army. Miyashita tries to plead with his boss, but the latter snaps his neck, causing Miyashita to fall dead on the floor. Rikiya is seen shedding tears at his act while remarking on the shame, stating that he won't forget Miyashita.

   Details regarding the emergence of Quirks and how a peaceful coexistence was planned and how others believed that freely using their abilities was a basic right and anything other than that was suppression are revealed. This belief gained traction and led to the formation of the Meta Liberation Army led by Destro. Destro's capture and eventual suicide are mentioned, but also, unbeknownst to the public, the fact that he produced a child who is Rikiya Yotsubashi is mentioned to. For years, Rikiya had been working to gather enough power, influence, and supporters for the new Meta Liberation Army.

  <p key="d85d0f57-ac7b-44b7-b445-7f3b43df8524">
   Hours later, the CEO of Detnerat meets with his colleagues to discuss about several matters, being the most important being the issue of organizations threatening to overtake Destro's name, specifically the meddling of the League of Villains and its increasing prominence. Rikiya swears on Destro's name that they will wipe out the League of Villains.

Tomura tells the Clan that they will leave as soon as they finish collecting anything valuable.

The hulking villain is dismayed at their performance, tearfully crying out that Tomura is too weak to be a successor.

   In the middle of the confrontation between the League of Villains and Gigantomachia, a voice calls out from the radio. Spinner questions whether it is the doctor they have been looking for. Tomura confirms that it's All For One's doctor. The doctor asks Tomura if he and his friends are doing well. Tomura replies

  <p key="bea1bdb9-6902-45e1-a6dc-b94345a0b496">
   The doctor interjects to reveal that the hulking villain is a big supporter and confidant of All For One and once served as his bodyguard. He continues to say that Gigantomachia has endless stamina and needed no Quirk enhancements to complete duties assigned to him. The doctor notes that, after being weakened in his battle with All Might, All For One hid Gigantomachia as a means to ensure his dreams would be carried out.

  <p key="6dc9713f-2bac-4d7e-a0e1-0a6672f3667a">
   Dabi comments that Gigantomachia isn't a great gift. The doctor agrees replying with Gigantomachia is

   An irritated Tomura says that they don't want Gigantomachia. The doctor replies that he can be useful in the future and that Kurogiri has been babying Tomura for too long. Suddenly, black ooze, similar to the black ooze back from the Kamino Incident, emerges from the League's mouths. They are transported to a secret laboratory with multiple testing chambers with Nomus inside, and the Doctor hiding in the shadows.

   Dabi immediately notices that these Nomu are much different from previous ones. The excited doctor confirms that the Nomus are different from the

   Mr. Compress says that he can't see the doctor. The doctor, spooked by this, withdraws into a dark tunnel. The Doctor apologizes and explains that they are not to approach him unless they want to be transported back to Gigantomachia. The doctor continues, saying that he too is a close confidant of All For One and that he goes by the alias Daruma Ujiko. Daruma confesses that he summoned Tomura out of respect for All For One, saying his life, work and his Nomus, were all offered to him.
  </p>
  <p key="22422b11-25c0-47a6-9342-aaaffbe650cf">
   However, he states that Tomura has only been given the scraps believing him unworthy of handling more nor has he accomplished anything to prove otherwise. Then Daruma asks Tomura why he should help him.
   Tomura begins to answer Daruma's question of what does he have to show him. He starts with that he doesn't remember much of his life before meeting All For One and Daruma.

   Flashbacks are shown of Tomura using his Quirk on his family. In the flashbacks, All For One encounters a homeless young Tomura. All For One, calls out to Tomura, by his real name, Tenko, saying "it must have hurt that no came to save you despite that you ran hoping to be saved." All For One embraces a crying Tenko while giving the question,

   He takes Tenko home declaring that from now on he will be his master. Daruma enters with the remains of Tenko's family (all hands) noting that Tenko's Quirk is rare and never before seen. The memories of his family and his frustrations at what happened compel Tenko to become violently sick, and go into shock. Daruma questions All For One if he should modify Tenko. All For One replies no and that he will teach him how to take his feelings and frustrations and give them purpose.
  </p>
  <p key="defba74d-bebc-44c4-9478-55dead12a0e9">
   Back at Daruma's laboratory in the present, Tomura confesses that he felt empty before meeting All For One. He also confesses that his hands make him feel both nauseous and at peace yet his heart feels heavy which causes his rage. He explains that it's this juxtaposition of feelings that makes him hate everything and want to destroy everything. Tomura says that he will show Daruma heaven and hell if he will help.
  </p>
  <p key="f495e6d0-3806-4ace-ac00-66769cfabcce">
   Laughing, Daruma responds that it's a childish dream but is impressed by how serious Tomura is in his dream. Daruma agrees nonetheless. Mr. Compress notes how easy it was to convince the doctor while Himiko Toga questions if destroying everything includes what she loves. Tomura replies that they should get what they want as well which gives the other members relief.

  <p key="452adbae-cf2b-4614-aa1c-6e1667db70c5">
   Daruma admits that the plan was to always help but he wanted to see Tomura's development. He also admits that he cannot help until they get Gigantomachia to submit. Dabi interrupts saying he will not go back to fight Gigantomachia; plus he has a good potential ally waiting. Daruma interjects that Dabi can stay back to help him test out his High-End Nomus. Daruma sends the remaining League of Villain members back to Gigantomachia at Tomura's request using

   Over a month and a half of first making contact with Daruma Ujiko, Tomura and his subordinates have been fighting Gigantomachia all along. The members take turns assisting Tomura in battle. Tomura, being All For One's successor, is Gigantomachia's main target and doesn't care that other members wander off.
  </p>
  <p key="2d4d2a56-39bc-4d67-b7ed-8274b238d351">
   However, this proves to be futile as Gigantomachia is able to fight for 48 hours and 44 minutes straight without end and his body grows in size during battle. He sleeps for three hours before resuming. He reveals to the League of Villains that he has a heightened sense of hearing and smell. This makes it difficult to attack Gigantomachia even in his sleep. Keeping his word, Daruma refuses to fully help the League until Gigantomachia submits. He gives them a one-time meager allowance.
  </p>
  <p key="e79bf46d-fc49-4301-baed-420ca5886dc2">
   It's mid-December, Tomura, Twice, and Mr. Compress try to ambush Gigantomachia in the air, but Gigantomachia counters with a powerful shockwave that sends them reeling back. Tomura and the others survive the onslaught and Gigantomachia eventually falls asleep again.

   On their way to meet with the other members, Spinner reflects on how the League no longer aligns with Stain's ideals. He questions Himiko on why she is still with the League. She responds that she still loves Stain, Izuku Midoriya and

   Himiko checks on Tomura's condition and her leader rests with a wicked smile on his face. He claims Gigantomachia has gotten much slower since when they first fought and truly believes he's closer to getting him to submit. Spinner notes how Tomura's eyes still possessed the look of a determined boy chasing after his dreams'.
  </p>
  <p key="1bf1fea2-fafd-42e9-b5e6-119020db2cb2">
   At that moment, Twice receives a call from Giran, who for unknown reasons hasn't answered the League calls for weeks. A frustrated Mr. Compress wants to know if his damaged prosthetic arm is insured. Split, Twice notes that Giran has been very good him since introducing him to the League, but the first thing he does when responding to the call is to reproach Giran for not picking up their calls for a long time. However, an unknown voice apologizes on behalf of the broker, because he is not responsible for that.
  </p>
  <p key="6ca47de6-8924-48c7-8132-288d868e822b">
   The voice on the other end speaks in a different voice and Compress wonders if Giran is using a voice changer, but Twice realizes that the speaker is someone else and asks what happened to Giran. The voice answers with 'check the news'. Compress uses his own phone to do that. The news talks about the mysterious appearance of five severed fingers of a hand and five pieces of clothing in five different location: Central Fukuoka, the Central High, the Shie Hassaikai Compound, Hosu City Terminal, and at Ground Zero in Kamino Ward. Mr. Compress notes that all the locations are where the League has been.

  <p key="4834e562-f657-4054-b82d-b4bb10159332">
   The voice on the phone introduces itself as the Grand Commander of the Meta Liberation Army, Re-Destro. Tomura jokes if they are another retro freak organization that wants to make a comeback and ride the League's popularity and questions if it is because of the book. Re-Destro replies that it is the Army that initiated the League's popularity wave.

  <p key="6da8ff25-ff23-4429-9f75-2f8b8d0c1760">
   Twice interrupts to ask what Re-Destro has done with Giran and what does he want. Re-Destro answers that Giran is alive. He informs the League that Meta Liberation Army seeks to free all Meta-Humans by dismantling the current framework of society and rebuild it so that all Meta-Humans 'can be themselves and use their abilities as they see fit'. Mr. Compress comments that he doesn't see why the should oppose the Army. Himiko questions if they are going to help the Army like they helped the Yakuza. Tomura answers that Re-Destro should 'liberate the broker' and call back because he's busy.
  </p>
  <p key="9ea891fd-bf85-4627-b82d-0825c0ca3122">
   Re-Destro continues with that he won't let the broker go because he's allowed them to gain valuable information of the League. Re-Destro commends Giran for his resistance, destroying his client list and refusing to talk or emit emotion even while they chopped off his fingers. However, the Army was able to recover the deleted list. Re-Destro explains that his Army has waited patiently for generations while spreading its roots far and wide and amassing over 100,000 ready-to-act liberation warriors. Some members of the Army include Tomoyasu Chikazoku, a board member of leading information technology company, Feel Good,

   Spinner is shocked by Re-Destro's claims and thinks he is just bluffing, but Re-Destro immediately informs them that he knows they are deep in Niigata mountainside. Twice becomes alarmed and throws his phone, but Re-Destro proclaims that it's too late; his satellites have already locked on their location and will track them no matter where they go. He warns that all the heroes will be on them with a simple phone call. Tomura thanks Re-Destro for the warning and asks what he wants.

   The members of the League begin to wonder if Re-Destro's threats and boasts are real or only bluff, but Twice emphatically demands they save Giran. He continues with saying that Giran gave him a place to belong and that they must go and save him. Himiko Toga interjects that the Meta Liberation Army could be lying and that Giran could already be dead. Mr. Compress urges Twice to calm down while pointing out that Twice wants the group to "plunge headlong into unknown danger". Tomura removes Twice's mask to shut him up and tells everyone he has a plan to solve his problems, and radios the doctor.

   Daruma comments how the League is stirring up bygone groups like the Army. Mr. Compress asks if he can send a High-End Nomu, but the doctor responds that it's not possible because they are not ready yet. Shigaraki tells him that he had no intention of using them, and asks how long before Gigantomachia wakes up. Mr. Compress answers: two hours and thirty-five minutes. Tomura asks the location of Dabi from the doctor in which he responds that Dabi is on the border between Mie and Shiga prefectures. Tomura requests that the doctor warp them to Aichi.

   Alarmed, Spinner questions if they are really going into the Army's trap. Tomura responds that after more than a month fighting he learned that Gigantomachia isn't invincible, just highly powered, and formulates his plan to kill two birds with one stone: they'll attack Deika City, the base of the MLA, to rescue Giran, and attract Gigantomachia to Tomura after he wakes up from one of his naps. This sets their two opponents against each other and lets the Army weaken Gigantomachia while the latter destroys the former.

   The doctor yells how underhanded Tomura is being and wonders if Re-Destro was bluffing. Tomura replies he just doesn't care. Spinner is concerned that they're charging into a trap but Tomura plans on using the liberation army's numbers to wear down Gigantomachia's insane stamina. Tomura returns Twice's mask and says the liberation army will never know what hit them.

   A few minutes later, the entire League of Villains meet up atop a hill overlooking Deika City. Since there is still an hour and fourty minutes until Gigantomachia wake up, Mr. Compress notes they are going to have to fight and the task will not be easy. Dabi is annoyed they dragged him into their rescue mission and this angers Twice. Himiko notices someone approaching the group and everybody ready to attack. It turns out to be an escort, the Pro Hero Slidin' Go, to guide the League into town and meet with Re-Destro.

Before leaving, Slidin' Go states that the town isn't his usual location but today is a big exception. The group is greeted by Trumpet and Curious. Koku confirms the Deika City is a liberated district where the majority of residents, including heroes, align themselves with the Liberation Army.

Gesturing to a tower, Koku comments that Giran is with Grand Commander, Re-Destro. Twice is irked by the Army's lie of handing over Giran if the League showed while Tomura proclaims that Koku is the mini-boss and calls for his group to move onward towards the tower, while killing several army goons. Himiko starts to run but the ground beneath her explodes, causing her to fall. Uninterested with the other five villains, Curious confronts Himiko and demands an interview covering her descent into madness, but Himiko angrily rejects it.

   Meanwhile, in Deika's central tower, a bound Giran interjects that Re-Destro has made two mistakes: he won't be treated like a damsel in distress and that the tranquility of the city will be destroyed if the League of Villains releases Nomu.

Curious comments that the warriors have been training their minds and bodies for the Army's cause. She continues that it's irritating that the League, with no great cause or ideology, has garnered such attention.

Himiko attempts to suck in their blood and disguise herself to blend in, but the ingested blood explodes inside her, seriously injuring her, destroying her gear and leaving her body bloodied and battered. Curious states that she came prepared to avoid Himiko's tricks in order for their "interview" to go unhindered.

   The injured Himiko manages to escape the bar, but Curious' subordinates keep attacking her. As she fights, Curious reveals that Himiko is the first daughter of the Toga family, born August 7. Once described as cheerful and well-mannered but disappeared after her middle school graduation and is currently 17. Curious demands to know why Himiko left a normal life behind to become a serial killer while stating Himiko's story will benefit the Army, and signals for her men to stop. Finally, answering Curious question about normal life, Himiko replies that for her it is normal.

   Himiko begins to remember her past. When she was a child she was fascinated by blood due to her Quirk, leading her to kill and suck the blood of birds and proudly display the bloody bodies to her parents. Disturbed and disgusted with her behavior, her parents brought her to a Quirk counselor which amounted to telling her to suppress her impulses for the sake of looking normal. Himiko grew up to become a young girl without ever showing her bloody instincts, and her classmates all thought of her as a bright and happy young woman.

One day, Himiko stabbed him using a box cutter, then drank his blood with a straw as she had a look of ecstasy. Soon after, she disappeared and hid from both the police and Pro Heroes, as she was now a wanted suspect due to the attack.

   Back to the present, the confrontation between Curious and Himiko continues, the former remarking on how fascinating it is that Himiko thinks she lives a normal life. She tells Himiko that she's the embodiment of the dark side of the hero society.

   The Meta Liberation Army leader continues her speech, saying that Himiko's “normal” and the ideals of the Army aren't much different. She says that that's why Himiko will become a martyr to show the world the cause of the Meta Liberation Army, and as the other members of the Army surround her and Chitose, the leader tells her to die so that she can become a tragedy.

Himiko refuses to believe she's miserable and only believes that she's happy sucking the blood of the people she loves. She takes out a small vial of blood and transforms into Ochaco Uraraka. An excited Curious notices the transformation, and exclaims that Himiko's going to make her cry. She starts listing the details of Transformation, and adds that Himiko must have transformed into Ochaco because she wants to die looking cute.

Skeptic taunts Giran, explaining that they got the idea to use puppets with Jin's likeness after finding out Twice's psychological weaknesses from Giran himself.

However, after seeing Stain on television, he was given a new purpose in life. He gives a speech both showcasing his new resolve to see Tomura's world come to fruition. He admits he might not be a worthwhile person who can't accomplish anything without standing on the shoulders of others, but there is nothing wrong with that, and calling Trumpet out as being no different than him, much to Trumpet's disdain.

However, he says that Quirks are also directly linked to the personality, and Tomura's Decay is a good example of this credo.
