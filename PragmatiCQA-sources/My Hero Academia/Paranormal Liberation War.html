Spinner desperately tries to reawaken Tomura so he can command Gigantomachia to do something. Nejire attempts to stop him, but Dabi blasts her with his flames while breaking free of Best Jeanist’s fibers and faces his youngest brother. Tomura reawakens and orders Gigantomachia to attack, to which the latter agrees and begins to tear his restrains, forcing Jeanist to struggle.

   Not far from there, three of the Near High-End Nomu who are fighting the heroes hear Gigantomachia's call and break away from the other heroes to aid Gigantomachia. As they arrive, the battered Izuku attempts to move in order to help him, but he can't due his body being very badly injured. Suddenly,

   With Gigantomachia neutralized, Best Jeanist proceeds to tighten his hold on the remaining PLF members hoping to knock them out. Despite being completely restrained by Jeanist's cables, Mr. Compress uses his Quirk to free himself and compress Tomura,

Even Izuku attempts to stop All For One, but the villain easily blasts him away with an air cannon and tells him that when Tomura's body is complete they will meet again.

   As "Tomura" and his allies escape the battlefield, the remaining Pro Heroes who survived in the front-line, as well as the Heroes who had finished evacuating civilians, joined together to try and halt Tomura's escape. However, they were only able to take down three Nomu, whereas Tomura and the rest escaped. A few hours later, after being completely in control of Tomura's body, All For One commands his remaining Near High-End Nomus to retrieve his own body from Tartarus.

  <p key="6d730475-b4b3-492f-8a2d-8a7fdb3a0e6e">
   However, it was also a strategic victory for the villains. The war was tremendously costly for heroes, and represents a tremendous crisis for hero society in general. At least 132 members go missing, including Tomura Shigaraki himself, who escaped on his own with a few allies and several Near High-End Nomu.

  <p key="fab84ce6-0a93-497d-b592-91c71df7a886">
   Dozens of heroes died during the conflict in addition to numerous wounded. Gigantomachia destroyed several cities during his rampage, killing hundreds of civilians. Some heroes are starting to defect due this carnage.

Then, in order to make it harder for the authorities to track him, he sent his Near High-End Nomus, as well as some of the escaped prisoners to attack other prison, releasing even more villains and criminals.

   All this carnage is causing turmoil in the hero society of Japan, as well as generating a lack of confidence in the heroes themselves among citizens. Due to the unwillingness to clean up and fix the mass destruction, the civilian society has stopped trusting both the heroes and law enforcement agencies in the recent events with the war. It has also destroyed the hero status quo, regarding the lack of faith in heroes that remain after the war. Some hero agencies closed up due to increased battles between civilians and villains alike, resulting of collateral damages that are beyond repair, forcing many civilians to obtain support items to defend themselves, making the jobs for both the police and the heroes a lot harder: students and pro heroes alike are now questioning the future of their society.
