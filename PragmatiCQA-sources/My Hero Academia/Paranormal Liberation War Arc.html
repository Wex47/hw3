   As Shota reflects on how Oboro had died being
   crushed by a collapsing building
   during an internship they had in high school, and how they had initially planned to all form an agency together, Naomasa continues that they theorize Kurogiri is a Nomu created from Oboro's body as a base. Hizashi is dumbstruck at the revelation, unsure how to comprehend the information, while Gran Torino thinks about how

   After Naomasa states that Kurogiri is currently sedated so as he doesn't attempt to use his Quirk, Shota questions what them two are doing there.

Hizashi wonders if it should be the Oboro's that should be there instead, which Naomasa says they will contact next if they fail. Shota activates his

   As Kurogiri wakes up, the investigation begins, to which he comments how he hadn't seen Shota since the U.S.J. Incident. Hizashi notes that the black fog doesn't vanish even with Shota looking at him, meaning Kurogiri's body is made of the black substance, trying to doubt himself that he's actually Oboro. Kurogiri asks about

   's current status, but they refuse to say anything, which saddens him. Shota asks if he is worried about Tomura, to which Kurogiri says he is because watching over him is his mission, and that he is not the one to abandon others when Hizashi questions him on his "job".
  </p>
  <p key="87d3930b-4529-4c93-9f27-e277212083f3">
   Shota starts to talk to Kurogiri about the time he left behind a stray kitten without picking it up and how Oboro picked it up without a second thought. He is confused about what he's talking about, but Shota continues to talk about how he felt he always hesitated back then and did things half-done, but Oboro always pulled him along. Kurogiri tries to question his motivation, but Shota keeps talking about how Oboro kept pushing forward without thinking of the consequences, even though death meant the end for him.

   Shota tells him that that he and Hizashi are teachers now and that he's strict with his students, to which Gran Torino asides about Shota's high expulsion rate, but Hizashi implies there's more to it than what it seems. At around the same time back in U.A., the students of Class 2-A talk about their reaction to seeing Shota's face when he was leaving the building earlier. One student talks about how it was similar to when he had expelled them, with some still not being happy about it, while
   one of the others
   feels like the situation has helped them to grow.

  <p key="ed716d69-18aa-4dbf-a991-20bac4ef9c43">

   for the ability to expel and re-enroll students, as he felt that self-sacrifice isn't the same as throwing one's life away, and that he wants to teach students what 'death' is like, if only once, which he felt would make them strive higher, to which Nezu accepted. Shota faces Kurogiri, yelling that he wants people like Oboro to become heroes who can pull other people along and live long lives. He shows his goggles to Kurogiri and yells to him, with tears in his eyes, that if Oboro is still in there, then they should strive to be heroes together again.

  <p key="3ec83208-e480-41e4-a7bc-392bcf2273b5">
   Upon detecting that Kurogiri's brainwaves have started to act unusual, Naomasa quickly asks about the location of where the Nomu are manufactured and where Tomura is. Seeing that Kurogiri is losing control and getting agitated, Shota continues to call him Oboro, and doing all he can to try and get him to remember who he is. Kurogiri continues to insist that they are mistaken for someone else, and that he is just "Kurogiri", but Shota and Hizashi continue calling him Oboro Shirakumo and their words finally manage to take effect, as the black fog that forms Kurogiri's head scatters enough to show the shadowed face of Oboro himself.
  </p>
  <p key="36ca3516-561c-4193-8671-ebe527684c7d">
   Oboro tries to call out to Shota, who asks him to keep fighting. Oboro manages to say "hospital" before the fog hides his face again and Kurogiri falls unconscious. Naomasa congratulates both heroes for their help, while Hizashi comforts Shota with tears still streaming down his eyes. Later, as Shota and Hizashi prepare to head out, he apologizes for not being more helpful, but Naomasa corrects him that thanks to them they have made progress. Gran Torino apologizes for having forced them to reopen an old wound, and when Shota wonders why All For One created the Nomu in the first place, he recalls a metaphor the villain told them, comparing the creation of the Nomu to producing wine: trampling grapes (people) to extract the juice (Quirks), and letting them ferment into wine (Nomu).

Based on that information, Katsuki figures that all Quirks within One For All must be "lame", considering the past users as 'nobodies'. Izuku tries defending Lariat's strength, but Katsuki points out that he likes any Quirk. All Might agrees with Katsuki, as he tells them that All For One was obsessed with the Quirk, and it caused him to destroy all the strong people because they defied his evil.

   About a week after receiving the "hospital" tip, Twice meets up with Hawks asking for advice on what to say about the "idea of liberation", saying that the others in his unit don't trust him and wonders if he should just express his own views. Hawks reflects on how, over the past month, he managed to figure out the different regiments for the Paranormal Liberation Front and their lieutenants. First, there's "Black", the tactical regiment which provides support for the other three regiments led by Twice, "Violet", the raid regiment which supervises the positions of everyone around the country, with one exception, led by

   Hawks thinks that if they make the first move in the war to come, it'll all be over. He also muses how he was able to figure out all the members without getting caught despite the intense surveillance and administrative limits, but says it's thanks to the negotiation skills he learned since he was young. He also notes how lots of the members despise the current system, so he informs Twice to tell them that they'll trample over the society that has suppressed individuals' freedom as well as mention allegiance to

   Hawks realizes their plan is to attack major cities all across the nation, where Re-Destro and his other party leaders will take over the non-functioning and lawless cities, distributing items and the call for freedom in the name of self-defense. With Tomura sitting on a throne of rubble amidst the chaos, Hero Society will be completely destroyed. He internally thanks Twice for helping him get all the pieces into place in his mind, admitting that he felt he was the one he had to look out for the most after he learned he overcame his trauma, seeing him as no longer a minor villain, while also acknowledging Twice as a good-hearted person.

   He thinks back to earlier when Twice asked him how he understands the

   very well and he tells him he empathizes with them, for the world he longed for in the past felt like a cage he was trapped in, and wants to fly freely. Twice enthusiastically tells Hawks he'd take him to see Tomura if it weren't for the bugs on his wings placed by Skeptic, and he ends up revealing to Hawks that he's in the mountains in Kyoto. Back in the present, Twice tells Hawks that a person who helps their companions isn't a bad person, to which Hawks reaffirms his belief that Twice is kind.

   Several heroes, including Crust, try to make it to Mirko's location, but are also halted by Nomu getting in the way. Mirko charges for Kyudai, ready to kick him to see if he's the real deal, leading him to panic and remember the High-End Nomu he had created. He believes activating them now would be a bad idea due to still being in the testing phase, as even Hood took 10 hours to fully stabilize, but with no other option, he pulls out a device ready to activate the High-Ends.

   Just before Mirko's leg makes contact with Kyudai's arm, she gets pushed out of the way by another smaller Nomu, named Mocha, who uses the Double Quirk to create a clone of Kyudai that Mirko kicks away. The distraction lasts long enough for Kyudai to activate the 5 remaining High-Ends, while also praising Mocha for using its Quirk without him telling it to. Kyudai orders the High-Ends to destroy the Heroes as one of them comes out and slams Mirko into a large tanker. As the High-Ends prepare to go wild and destroy all the Heroes, Crust finally arrives at the lab. One of the High-Ends recognizes him and prepares to fight him, while Mirko, who survived the attack, says that she's just getting warmed up as she prepares to fight them as well.

   Crust uses his

   The Doctor frantically types away at his computer, complaining at how he selected the most battle-crazed villains and that preparing those candidates took a lot of time and effort. He says that artificially transplanting Quirks into a person's body requires complex surgery and takes at least three months to fully integrate into the body, and without All For One, High-End production is very tough.

   Luna Ring
   to blow away the Nomus but one of them rips off her left arm using a black hole Quirk. She smashes a Nomu with
   Luna Fall
   before charging at the Nomu that took her arm, who is surprised by how she charged in so dauntlessly. She tells the Nomu as she lands on his shoulders that people like him only fight at a distance, never close. The Nomu tells her to die but she tells him only when she's ready, and uses
   Luna Tijeras
   to rip off the Nomu's head, killing it.

   After she uses her hair to stabilize her severed arm, she tells the Nomus that since their heads are their weak spots, she'll aim for them. She also says that she lives her life everyday like there's no tomorrow for her so when it's time for her to die, she'll have no regrets, and the Nomu will not be the end of her.

Edgeshot yells to let no one escape because they're well trained and ready to give their lives to their cause and to let one escape could lead to them terrorizing other places, which is why they must fight back. Midnight comforts a still nervous Denki by saying that if he can't focus on random people elsewhere, he can think of the person who matters the most to him. Denki turns around and looks behind him, stating internally that he wants to be with all of his friends, especially Kyoka. Kyoka then hopes for him to complete the mission quickly and safely.

   The villain declares that their numbers are insignificant, ready to unleash his

   Quirk at full power. Fumikage watches Denki charge forward and thinks back to when they practiced together, how he hurt himself strumming the guitar and he offered for the two of them to take a break, but Denki said they should keep going a little longer because he wants to help out Kyoka anyway he can with his performance. From this statement, Fumikage deduces that Denki is a man who cares deeply for his friends from the bottom of his heart. The villain unleashes a move called
   Supreme Discharge: Thundernet
   on to the Heroes, but to his shock, his electricity is absorbed by Denki, who yells that they need to mop up all the others so the one's left behind don't need to worry.

   Hawks reveals the reason how he managed to message the Heroes the location of the hideout while destroying the trackers attached to his wings. Hawks also mentions that he had to keep on eye on the sheer numbers of villains there and Twice due to Double's dangerous potential. He continues to reveal how easy it was just getting Twice to trust him, and that he intends to turn the masked villain in once the war is over.

Upon remembering these horrible memories, Twice realizes his huge mistake of trusting others so easily and starts breaking down emotionally, tearfully stating that once again his trusting of others leads to dire consequences for him and the League. Twice admits to Hawks the reason he trusted him was due to feeling sympathetic to the latter's goal of wanting to live in a free society, and that it's sad if nobody trusts you. Hawks thanks Twice and tells him that after he pays for his crimes, he can make a fresh start and start over, even offering to help him get back on his feet, telling him that he is a good person.

   Upon hearing those words, Twice starts lashing out at Hawks with rage and anger, disregarding his statements. Twice tells the Winged Hero that he doesn't care about the whole system anymore and admits his hatred of Heroes. Hawks attempts to reason with Twice but the latter refuses to let anyone take advantage of his kind nature ever again. Twice then unleashes his Super Move:
   Sad Man's Parade

Twice lets out an enraged scream as their battle begins. Meanwhile, Dabi heads straight towards their location with a sinister grin on his face, knowing that Hawks was the traitor of the organization all along, monologuing to himself that it isn't Twice's fault, rather it's the scummy heroes are the ones to blame.

   Meanwhile, Hawks slashes apart Twice's Sad Man's Parade barrage effortlessly. He tells him the rate he conjures his clones is incredible, but also that they decrease in durability the more he uses his Quirk. Hawks claims that he doesn't allow himself to get attached and must finish this mission now that he's this deep, reminding Twice that he could have just complied peacefully in the beginning because he likes him. Twice refuses and creates Doubles of the League of Villains, stating that they're his only allies, but Hawks destroys those Doubles instantly.

   Hawks tells Twice that the reason Heroes eliminate Villains quickly is because a person who never gives up is a Hero's worst fear, and in his own experience, someone who never gives up never stops putting up a fight.

Hawks tells Dabi he nearly burned Twice, but Dabi claims he knew Hawks would have gotten him out of the way since that what Heroes are supposed to do. Hawks asks if at any chance he blew his cover did Dabi suspect him, but Dabi confesses he never trusted Hawks from the beginning.

Twice agrees and the two of them give each other a high-five.

He says that the Pros had the students subdue a slew of opponents with their wide range Quirks and close them in, and now they will gradually take them down, so they are done borrowing the strength of the kids and will take care of everything else. Fumikage then notices a blast of fire coming out of the mansion, recognizing Hawks' feathers. He also thinks back to his initial internship with Hawks, when he asked him what his weakness is. Hawks answers it is fire because his feathers burn up easily, and when asked about any countermeasures, he only responds with getting the job done fast enough before they can use it against him.

After thinking back to when the government officials placed him in a special program to make him a 'special hero', how they told him to discard his name, and how he accepted the grueling training if it meant he could be like Endeavor, he asks Dabi who he is, and Dabi answers, leaving Hawks shocked.

The revelation shocks Fumikage, as Dabi rhetorically asks him if he came here to save Hawks and says to him that the Pro Hero he looks up to is far dirtier than the Villains present. Hawks attempts to speak to Fumikage, albeit weakly, while he answers Dabi by saying he is concerned for his teacher, only for Dabi to call him thoughtless.

Hawks tells Fumikage that Dabi is still talking, as he continues his conversation by telling him to think for once about who really needs salvation, but Fumikage ignores him by listening to Hawks.

   He had realized that Dabi wasn't able to finish him off earlier because he was talking to him, and he is doing it again, deducing that he isn't being cocky, rather he's buying himself time until he can use his flames effectively.

   Back with Kyudai and Present Mic, the mad doctor praises Tomura for saving some of the Nomu and they were activated when he used Radio Waves. He does admit they haven't reached the testing phase so they can't think for themselves, but their strength is phenomenal, so he classifies them as 'Near High-Ends'. Gran Torino moves to Eraser Head's location to cut the High-Ends off and tells Deku and Katsuki to hide.

   Tomura decides to take out Eraser Head and charges at him, calling him a hindrance to his plans. As Rock Lock readies to defend Eraser Head, he wonders if he will die if he reaches him. He thinks about all of his students in Class 1-A and

   , and declares that he needs to live and watch over them so they can graduate and become Heroes. He yells to Tomura that he is the only hindrance just as he bypasses Rock Lock and Gran Torino who attempts to reach out to Eraser Head. Suddenly, Deku flies in and tackles Tomura, pushing him away from his teacher. Katsuki also arrives, as the two of them think about all he had done for them, and Katsuki declares that this time, it is their turn to save him.

  <p key="a6fed63f-2cf2-462b-8c7e-ee09eff8d05d">
   Gran Torino and Eraser Head are stunned by Deku and Katsuki's sudden appearance as they manage to push Tomura back. Deku thinks about how thanks to Eraser Head, Tomura is unable to use his Quirks, and since the other Heroes are busy keeping the Near High-Ends at bay, they need all the help they can get. Deku turns to the others and says the "worst-case scenario" would be losing their teacher, the one who has been looking after them since day one. The statement leaves Eraser Head speechless, as he thinks back to the day he told Deku he could never be a Hero with his power.

Deku tries using Blackwhip to hold him back but Tomura pulls him closer while telling Katsuki face-to-face that he isn't interested in him anymore. Suddenly, Endeavor returns and blasts Tomura away from the two students. He asks the two of them where Shoto is, and Deku answers that it is just him and Katsuki present.

   After regaining his footing, Tomura expresses delight that Endeavor still has some fight in him. Gran Torino comments that Tomura's strength is beyond comprehension, while Endeavor reveals it is close to All Might's strength. Eraser Head nevertheless says that as long as he keeps his eyes on Tomura, they have the advantage, so he will hold out as long as he can. Endeavor tells Deku and Katsuki that they can act without his direction in this situation, but he wants them to support Eraser Head and protect each other. Tomura moves forward hoping to grab Deku and One For All, but as he demands he gives it to him, he ends up calling Deku his "little brother"; a statement that leaves both of them confused.

He quickly realizes the ego of his master still exists within All For One, saying to him internally that this is his own body and therefore his own power and the hallucinations he has of him aren't what is motivating him. He explains that in the past he saw All For One as the "Ruler of Darkness", yet he was defeated by only one person: All Might. Tomura thanks All For One for raising him from the bottom of his heart, but he doesn't want to end up like him; he wants to be greater. He destroys the hallucination and tells him to keep his desires to himself because this is

   Gran Torino then kicks Tomura in the face and says that they need to hold him off and counter because of how powerful he is. He angrily demands Tomura not to trample all over Nana Shimura's heart with his vile essence, but all Tomura says in response is "Who...?" Tomura manages to make a straight dash towards Deku but is surprised by Katsuki appearing above him as he yells out that Deku was baiting him out so he could unleash a huge explosion from his gauntlets. Endeavor witnesses Tomura get hit as he remembers All Might telling him he doesn't need to copy him to be the new Symbol of Peace. He charges forward and uses a new Super Move:

   As the Villains talk about how Gigantomachia had snatched them up, Dabi deduces that Tomura has awoken, while Himiko is surprised he is ahead of schedule. Skeptic tries to get off wanting to stay and backup Re-Destro, but is held back by Dabi. He responds to note that the Heroes haven't noticed they are on his back yet.

Suddenly, they're attacked by Geten, who's confused by the whole situation. Cementoss proceeds to attack the distracted villain, when out of nowhere, Re-Destro emerges from underground while battling Edgeshot, saving Geten. Re-Destro mentally notes that if Gigantomachia is active, then Tomura must be awake. He stops the Heroes in their place and orders the other members to follow the giant and begin their revolution.

   Meanwhile in the rear view, Kyoka who is listening in with her Earphone Jack is shocked overhearing something big coming, causing the other Heroes to head forward while the students hang back. Kamui Woods swings through the trees with Midnight on his back as they attempt to get closer to Gigantomachia's face. Despite her best efforts, Gigantomachia swats Mt. Lady away as he decides to take a shortcut to Tomura. Despite Kamui Woods' concerns, Midnight convinces him to keep moving. She says that if Gigantomachia makes it into the city, he will destroy it, and if they can't stop the behemoth by force, they will put him to sleep, which is what she plans to do with her Quirk.

   Kamui Woods is then doused in a stream of blue fire courtesy of Dabi. As Midnight notes the group, she ends up slamming into several pieces of building debris released by Mr. Compress, causing her to fall to the ground as Gigantomachia makes his way. Midnight tries thinking of various people who could put the giant to sleep before contacting Momo. After confirming she knows the situation, Midnight tells her that she needs to put Gigantomachia asleep with an anesthetic, even if it is against the law. Before Momo can ask what is going on, Midnight is ambushed by several Liberation soldiers, but not before telling her that if it's too difficult, they can hand the anesthetic to the Heroes and evacuate. As she turns to face her attackers, she thinks back to Momo's performance during the Joint Training Battle and that she will make a fine leader someday, so she will trust her judgement.

She also adds that Mezo can use his eyes since he is so massive. She asks Juzo to lend a hand as Kyoka reports that she can see him.

Momo creates anesthetics that she hands to her friends while saying that she never learned to be a Hero that shows their back to an enemy. She says she will fight and Denki agrees to back her up, because when they don their costumes and step outside, they become Heroes, regardless of whether or not they are students, as everyone else happily agrees.

Suddenly, there are explosions heard around Gigantomachia, and Momo reveals explosives were planted in the softened areas Juzo made, with their goal to make him sink even deeper. Spinner suggest Gigantomachia use his

   Mt. Lady finally pushes Gigantomachia down on the ground and opens up his mouth, recognizing the students' plan, for the sedative to be administered. Mina moves in making her way through the flames with her Acidman.
   She tells herself to let her fear-stricken heart melt away as she yells for Gigantomachia to fall asleep. The giant, however, realizes that in order for him to reach Tomura as fast as he can, he needs to shake these Heroes off of him. When he says that though, Mina stiffens up, realizing that the monster she is facing is the same behemoth she confronted that day back in middle school, and how she collapsed in fear after she chased him away. She briefly imagines herself as a middle school student and ends up losing her grip on the canister of sedative. At the same time, Gigantomachia finally manages to shake Mt. Lady off and flings her to the side, knocking her out.

Gigantomachia re-positions the League on his back as he believes the 'flies' are no longer around, but then notices Eijiro climbing on his body, as the young Hero announces his name and how he won't let there be any blood. Before he can chuck his canister into Gigantomachia's mouth, Himiko throws a knife at him and shatters it.

Tomura responds by saying that Heroes hurt their families to help others, the words of his father, which surprises Endeavor. He says that if that is conviction, then he has it too.
   As the Heroes take the moment for a breather, Tomura tells them that he considers Heroes to have only been pretending to protect society, asking how many times in the past have they turned a blind eye to things they couldn't protect or swept the filth of society under the rug, with him thinking about his own childhood experience. He says that rotting feeling accumulates over time, the trash coddled by being protected all the time, and fake Heroes only serving to spoil a pathetic society.

Tomura turns to face Gran Torino as he tries to jump away. Tomura, however, grabs Gran Torino's left leg and crushes it before slamming him into the ground. Endeavor, Katsuki, and Deku all try to reach him as Gran Torino takes a closer look at the twisted and warped face Tomura had. Gran Torino thinks back to when Nana Shimura left her son, Kotaro, at a foster home and how she told him that she made sure he couldn't be traced through the family registry, believing that if All For One ever found out about him, he would most likely exploit that. She says to him and herself that she never had a child, but she slowly starts breaking down into tears as he embraces her to comfort. Gran Torino also thinks about what Tomura claimed his father's words were about Heroes, and after connecting the dots, Gran Torino questions if the choice the two of them made was right just as Tomura punches straight through Gran Torino's chest, severely injuring him.

Enraged, Deku grabs Tomura with Blackwhip successfully and yells at him that he won't forgive him, which Tomura, in turn, says that he won't forgive anyone too as he elbows Deku right in the gut. He endures it, turning the rage he had towards Tomura into strength for his Blackwhip, which manages to keep Tomura restrained, allowing Katsuki and Endeavor to charge forward.

Izuku explains he wanted help with his new power, though the others point out his current hairdo, which he explains is because of a game where he tries to catch Katsuki with Blackwhip, only to lose every time, thus wanting advice from Hanta due to the similarities with his

   Quirk. After he suggests asking Shota Aizawa for help, All Might says he is still busy which is why they're unable to ask for assistance. All Might also turns to Ochaco and says that she is there to help him with body control while braking midair, justifying that he needs more power to cover up his practice of using Float.

  <p key="6dae966e-3b63-42f0-949e-65f1b15b0a07">
   As the training begins, All Might sits with Katsuki, explaining how Float is similar to Zero Gravity and this training will help give him some future control, maybe even help him unlock it. After a moment of silence, Katsuki tells All Might he won't be able to keep One For All's secret safe forever, especially since Izuku's Quirk has gone way beyond the scope of super strength. All Might says he isn't telling anyone about anything beyond Blackwhip, and this is so Float doesn't manifest the way Blackwhip did during the Joint Training Battle. He also reminds Katsuki of the night he told him about One For All and how he understood having power like that could put others at risk, since not all those who seek power are evil. After another moment of silence, Katsuki tells All Might that while Izuku trusts him with his life, in the notebook of the successors, he noticed his summary of the fourth was half-finished, while he included details of the fifth, sixth, and seventh, including cause of death. Not to mention when he brought up the topic of One For All being similar to All For One, he didn't tell him everything. Just as he inquires if he knows something else, All Might quickly denies anything else, not wanting to talk about things he's unsure about, as he is worried for Izuku, which he notices Katsuki is too.

  <p key="bb414ef0-390a-42d7-8842-4cd6bba2b413">
   Katsuki admits that Izuku always thinks about others and not himself, and with all his powers, it made him feel off about him, and because he ignored his own weaknesses, it is what caused him to bully him over the years. All Might says that Katsuki is now sincerely helping him with his training, as if it is his method of atonement, even if Izuku doesn't see it that way. All Might also says to Katsuki that when he compared him to Endeavor, it was based off the change in the two, since Endeavor didn't change his views until he saw his weak form. He believes Izuku and Katsuki will talk about it together someday though.

   In the present, Katsuki starts to develop a plan for a counterattack. Meanwhile, Deku continues to drag Tomura with Blackwhip noticing that he is becoming resistant to his 100% attacks yet the damage is sticking as his wounds are healing much more slowly. He does know that using 100% of One For All with his left arm has completely damaged it, but because he knows One For All is a power passed down to fight All For One, he feels it is time for him to release all of his strength and finish Tomura for good, no matter what happens to himself.

He starts to curse the Heroes for pushing him this far to his limits but stops and says that One For All is just in the way of his dream; a statement Deku says is One For All's purpose before he uses
   Texas Smash

   On the ground, Manual stands in awe at the incredible battle above, but Katsuki notes that Deku will die at this rate. He explains that Deku is using his legs and "
   Air Force
   " to avoid the recoil while using multiple Quirks at the same time, as well as using every move he has learned up until this point just to keep Tomura in the air, and since he couldn't take him out with the first attack, this battle has become a war of attrition where the two are wearing each other out, and against someone who can regenerate, Deku doesn't stand a chance. Katsuki then yells at Shoto asking if he has finished applying first aid, and as he says he is, Katsuki grabs him and his father as he tells him to hold off on the fire until he gets him up in the air and for Shoto to cool him off as long as possible. As Endeavor accepts Katsuki's plan, Rock Lock starts to worry if their plan will work, but the minute Shoto tells him to take care of their teacher, he remembers he already acknowledged the children as Heroes.

   The three fly into the air as Endeavor tells Katsuki to aim for when Blackwhip is completely extended and when he gets up there, the two need to get back to the ground or they may get caught up in the fire. As they fly, Katsuki thinks back to his talk between him, Izuku, and All Might, and how Katsuki compared Izuku to All For One based on how All For One created One For All in addition to possessing multiple Quirks. This causes Katsuki to believe that One For All is some kind of 'cursed power'. Nevertheless, he can't deny all the good it has done in the hands of All Might, and how Izuku was able to fulfill his dream of being a Hero with it.

   As the three reach the fight, Endeavor grabs Tomura as he yells for Deku to get down as he incinerates Tomura with
   Prominence Burn

   stabbed by rivets
   emitting from his back as he wonders why he won't die. 'Tomura' says something unintelligible before firing the rivet stabs directly at Deku, calling him his 'little brother'. In that moment, completely parallel to what happened back in middle school, Katsuki, without even thinking, pushes Deku out of the way and receives the full force of the attack.

   At this moment, after thinking about all the destruction and people who have suffered as well, Deku snaps. Filled with an intense rage, he bites down on Tomura's rivets and angrily demands he takes back what he says, as All For One's face manages to briefly emerge through Tomura's. In the scuffle, Tomura finally manages to touch Deku, with Shoto calling out to him in fear. Tomura demands Deku to give him One For All, as the two are suddenly flung into his mind.

   In the vestige world of One For All, a partially emerged Deku overhears Tomura arguing with someone to leave him alone, which turns out to be All For One, who has started to consume and fuse into Tomura's real self. All For One says that had he had not taken control of his body he would've been burnt to a crisp, or the fall from the height would've killed him. Tomura tells him to shut up, reminding him it's supposed to be his dream. Deku tries to move forward but trips and falls, due to his legs still not fully emerging. Nana Shimura soon appears, putting her hand on Deku's head, saying that even though he can't move they'll do something about it.

   Nana states that she never expected to meet All For One again after her passing, while he directs Tomura's attention to her, confirming her to be his grandmother. All For One explains how he had experienced dreams where he conversed with the consciousnesses of those whose Quirks he had stolen, how it always left him with an odd feeling of guilt, and that whenever he relinquished the Quirk, the voice would disappear. He continues that after meeting Kyudai Garaki that the reasoning behind this was because, just as organs and cells contain the memories of their owners, Quirks contain the consciousness of their users.

   All For One admits he is surprised at the revelation of the One For All users returning through the Quirk itself, believing him to be the only one capable of the feat, believing said trait was carried over when his brother's original transfer Quirk merged with the power-stocking one. Tomura starts to identify Nana from his memories, while she identifies him as Kotaro's son. Tomura however, tells her that no matter how they ended up in this situation, he despises her for his father's actions.

   One For All starts to crumble, which All For One attests to Tomura's rage overwhelming the rule of the wielder of One For All's will. He also notices Tomura trying to destroy him as well, which nonetheless thrills him because it suits him as the Symbol of Chaos. The eroding stops as All For One realizes his rage is not enough, as his younger brother, the first user, appears to hold them off, referring to him as being just as stubborn as himself.

   The first user asks if Tomura is the next in line of the various people he has manipulated, as All For One confesses he wished he made his brother his. In response, the first user declares that he and the others will never go to him because they have chosen to remain with Deku. As he starts pushing back, All For One tries combining his power with Tomura to fight back, as well as insulting Deku, claiming the power is wasted on him as he was unable to protect his friends or teachers, and that he gave himself over to the rage to the point of being unable to move currently. He declares that transferring this power to someone like Deku was a great mistake on his part.
  </p>
  <p key="33091bd6-7c81-49b3-a332-638f88e5fb5f">
   The first user denies this, claiming a man who does nothing but manipulate would never understand the driving force behind Deku. The rage he feels is because of others, and he does his best until he can no more. He declares Deku to be a boy possessed by the desire to save others beyond common understanding, and they will follow him because of it. Inspired, Deku charges toward Tomura as the two emerge back in the real world in their bodies, falling away from one another. Deku realizes Tomura failed to steal One For All, as All For One tells Tomura that the reason why was because his body hasn't fully adapted to his new Quirk yet. He tells him that his body needs to reach perfection and to retreat, while Deku pleads with Tomura to stop moving.

Himiko asks Mr. Compress where do Heroes draw the line, because if Heroes are supposed to save people, was Twice not a person in Hawks' eyes?

It turns out to be Ochaco and Tsuyu moving through the city, and when Himiko sees them too, she runs over to Mr. Compress asking him for her gear. After she puts it on, she prepares to confront them, which causes Mr. Compress to try to stop her, saying it is too dangerous, but she insists on finding the answers to her stifling feelings. Mr. Compress continues to dissuade her and even asks Dabi for help, but he dismisses it and instead tells Skeptic to ready himself, which irritates him. Spinner speaks up and tells Himiko that he believes himself and the others to be nothing and that they are strays that just happened to find one another, so she isn't the only one upset about Twice's death. He reminds her that their group was what Twice considered a family, and Tomura would probably like to see them all together, adding that their brand is to let folks do as they want, but she should come back to them quickly.

Seeing Gigantomachia approaching quickly, Ochaco tells Tsuyu to get the civilians in her possession to safety while she helps the old woman. She leads Ochaco to an alleyway calling her husband's name. Ochaco comments how fast she is running and she says it is because of her love for him.

Ochaco questions if Himiko seriously went through all the trouble just to ask her that question, including stealing blood from the old woman and potentially even killing her. Himiko is caught off guard by Ochaco's question as the young Hero tells her that she wants to save as many people as she can, and if she gets in her way, she will arrest Himiko on the spot.

She does know, though, that while she accepts that this is who she is as a person, other people don't think like her and therefore can't accept her, which she cites is the reason she has a hard time living in the current society.

   Zero Satellites

However, she tells Ochaco that she felt the same way about suppressing her feelings of draining blood since she was told to not do that in her youth, and when you shut your inner feelings inside, it only makes it grow. Ochaco tells Himiko that if she is going to live as she pleases hurting people, then she will have to live with those consequences. Himiko gets tears in her eyes and says that she thought so.

Ochaco, however, confidently tells her that Himiko just ran off, though she wonders why she had tears in her eyes as she picks up her keychain.

He tauntingly asks if being Number 1 is a lot of pressure and if his heart has been purified with all of the public's praise, and if his newfound vigor as a father figure to his children truly makes him feel like he is developing a bond with them. He yells that Endeavor was wrong to think if he kept walking towards the future the past would forget itself, so he is here to teach him a lesson: the past never dies. Dabi yells for Endeavor to dance with him in hell together.

Sadly, she only inherited Rei's ice Quirk and not his fire, but he was still happy either way, because he felt that since Toya had more potential, he could place all his ambitions on him.

   Back in the present, a dumbfounded Endeavor demands Dabi take back that 'despicable lie', but Dabi retorts that it is the 'despicable truth', and that he never suspected him because he put together an agency of fire and heat type Quirks. On the side, Mr. Compress and Spinner are amazed at the surprise, with Compress noting he being another with ‘quite the bloodline', while Spinner tries to wake up Tomura to give him an order. Dabi continues taunting Endeavor saying he would donate some blood and skin for a DNA test, but it doesn't matter because his own test results are being publicized as they speak.

He does know, however, that the populace may not be convinced by the words of a Villain so he continues his story claiming Endeavor forced his wife to keep having kids until finally, Endeavor got his masterpiece in the form of Shoto Todoroki, and even then he witnessed him abuse him. Dabi claims that Endeavor has no compassion; at his core he is a man addicted to the limelight and wallows in his own small-mindedness and self-importance, and someone like that is incapable of being a hero.

In Jaku City, Skeptic tells Dabi to thank him for splicing and editing the video, which he does since he found it to be so useful. Dabi then reveals something about Hawks to Endeavor as well as in the pre-recorded message, that in order for him curry favor with the League when he was undercover, he supposedly killed

Dabi concludes the message saying he can't stand the Pro Heroes, yelling that they are all twisted people with skeletons in their closets they try to cover with masks of justice, and they continue to fool people that way. He demands the people think critically about the 'heroes' they stand by who use the people to cover their inner dark sides through protection, approval, and admiration.

Spinner also sees that Gigantomachia has been out of breath since they arrived and after his previous order was issued. He understands that Gigantomachia is a being who can't go all out without receiving orders and desperately tries to wake Tomura up so he can begin the destruction he spoke about. Nejire Chan tries to strike Tomura at this moment, but unfortunately gets blasted by Dabi's flames, much to Shoto and the others' horror. As she falls out of the sky, Dabi tells Endeavor that once again, another child with a bright future has been burnt up by his flames as he breaks free of his restraints.

An incredulous Shoto asks Dabi if he is insane and Dabi confirms he doesn't feel things anymore.

Thankfully, Ingenium, Nejire Chan, and Katsuki arrive to back him up, with Katsuki thinking to himself that the explosions from the time he saved Deku were stronger, faster, and more condensed than his usual ones.

   According to the reports, Tomura had died when Mirko destroyed the capsule designed to resuscitate him, and that it wasn't the electric shock, but the power of All For One as well as his dreams and hatred were what brought him back to life; the result is many Heroes losing their lives in battle, including
   Native
   , Crust, Majestic, X-Less, and Midnight, who is being mourned by her students. People all across the country start talking about Dabi's video, with some wondering if it spells the end of Endeavor's Hero career and what will happen next. Some think about leaving the country while others hope for an explanation. Only a few believe everything will be okay.

   That same evening, somewhere deep in the forest, All For One, in command of Tomura's body, states that he won't give anyone a tomorrow or rest because now it is his turn, and it will never end, ordering the Near High-Ends to free his main body in Tartarus.

   Shortly afterwards, the Mainland Gate of Tartarus is attacked by the All For One controlled Tomura and his Near High-End Nomus, as the guards,
   Briareos
   and
   Gyges
   , report in regarding the chaos. Inside the facility, two guards on the lowest level are discussing Gigantomachia's eventual arrival for the following day. They talk about how he can't be killed by guns, and because he's technically human, there's still some ethics for them to follow about blasting him with missiles. One of the guards scoffs at the thought, saying how just like the rest of the inmates in the prison, they are all just dangerous beasts that only this Quirk-based society has allowed to live for this long; the other guard reminds him that they're being recorded and that even the dissolved Hearts and Mind Party could use this to their advantage, but the guard doesn't care.

   As the code red reaches the prison, the floors get sealed off with the gate lowered and drones sent out to attack the Nomu. All For One, however, flies over the chaos on a flying Nomu, where Tomura wakes up and attempts to take back control of his body. All For One tells him to rest, due to the Super Regeneration Quirk still needing time to heal the body, but Tomura rebukes saying he told him to rest in the first place, though All For One says he will after he finishes what he came for. He demands his body back again but All For One reminds him that this power is exactly what he wanted to spit at the hand that didn't help him, and now that he has it, what does it really matter. Tomura says he doesn't want to be his pawn, but All For One claims he is wrong, as he will become "the next me".

   All For One/Tomura uses Decay to destroy the guard tower, escaping from the attacking robots. He uses Search to find his body located 500 meters below sea level, realizing that even if he decayed the entire building, the water pressure would kill him, not to mention Tomura's body is starting to fall apart faster. He thinks about how even if he had Gigantomachia with him, and even if Tomura's body was complete, it would barely be of any help due to the amount of resources Tartarus has on hand. He figures the best and only way is for a coordinated operation, both inside and out, accomplished through his shared awareness.

   While driving to a destination alongside Best Jeanist, Hawks falls asleep and remembers his distant past. Years ago, his father, Takami, had killed someone over pocket change, and his mother,
   Tomie
   , harbored him, eventually resulting in his conception. His father abused Keigo physically and mentally, claiming that if he hadn't relied on his mother's Quirk, he would be a free man and not waste time around some punk child. Keigo understood how broken his parents were, yet he endured all of his emotions to avoid their fate. At one point he was assaulted by his father for going out into town one day, demanding he stay in the house, while his wife attempts to get him to calm down.

   One day, Keigo learns from his mother that his father had been arrested trying to steal a car, and the one who caught him was Endeavor, someone who he thought was merely a fantasy like the rest of the Heroes, re-invigorating his feelings of hope. His mother grew fearful that she would get arrested for harboring her husband, so they fled from their house, but she didn't have the strength to support the both of them. Keigo suggests going to the police to help, with his mother telling him to do whatever he can to make money, and make use of his wings for once. After the high-speed incident which caught the Hero Public Safety Commission's attention, they offer comprehensive support for him and his mother, and in exchange they will erase any connection to the Takami name so they can start over.

   Hawks re-awakens as Best Jeanist informs him they will reach their destination shortly. Due to his injured vocal cords, Hawks is forced to communicate with him by phone, apologizing for being allowed to sleep while he can't. Best Jeanist admits if it wasn't for Central Hospital's medical achievements, he would be lingering on the line between life and death. He also reveals that Central Hospital had created a procedure that would allow his body to enter a death-like state, inspired by the Nomu, which is something he still is upset at receiving. Hawks apologizes for it saying that he knew he couldn't trick the Paranormal Liberation Front with a cheaper trick, especially with the one responsible for the Nomu behind the scenes. Nevertheless, it was a success, and he brought his supposedly dead body to Dabi, and even after identifying his corpse, he bought the whole deception. Hawks then reveals that Dabi suggested they hang on to his body until it was the perfect time, which led to him being preserved in one of their facilities until Hawks revived him at the right time.

   Suddenly, Best Jeanist steers his car to a stop, revealing to Hawks that he has spotted a group of Villains causing trouble at a marketplace. The

He realizes Dabi's revelation had an even stronger effect to the populace, and decides to have some sidekicks dispatched to the neighborhood while taking note of the mixed response from both the happy and unconvinced civilians.

He finds a letter from her revealing that some men forced her to tell them about their family, and she has chosen to leave to not be a burden to him. She wishes him well and that she is proud of him. After reading the letter, Hawks admits he figured the leak came from his mother. Best Jeanist tries to console him but he tells him that when he abandoned the name ‘Takami', he essentially abandoned her too. He admits he feels relieved all of this has come back to him, and now that the Safety Commission has shut down, there is no one else around to give him orders. That now he is free of his shackles as he takes off his neck brace, while also thinking of the day his mother bought him the Endeavor plushie he held on to for so long, as she tells him to grow up strong like him.

   He says to Best Jeanist that when people get backed into a corner or are truly free, that is when they show their true nature, and it is because of that he considered Twice to be such a good person due to his desire to help others, and how he wants to be just like that. He comments that even if what Dabi said about the Todoroki Family is true, he deeply believes things are different now. When Best Jeanist asks what he plans on doing next, Hawks answers that he is going to address his origins to help Endeavor, who he definitely knows is in trouble.

He acknowledges that he froze up again when his son was in danger, and even though Best Jeanist's presence disproved a portion of Dabi's speech, he couldn't deny the truth anymore: He is paying the consequences for his selfish past and tossing Toya aside, and even if he survived, the name of "Endeavor" is dead.

He explained that the Himura Family was also considered a prestigious family so it was only fitting that a man of his accomplishments would take a Himura woman as a wife. Enji thinks that even though Rei knew this marriage was a Quirk Marriage, she still agreed to it for her family's sake. As the two were walking together, Enji noticed her looking at some flowers, where she tells them that she likes them because of how pretty they are.

Enji and Rei went to the hospital to discuss their son's condition, where the doctor explains that Toya has inherited an extremely powerful form of Enji's Quirk, but possesses his mother's physical condition, meaning his body is meant to withstand freezing temperature and not fire. The doctor tells them that this method of 'custom children' is taboo in the current Quirk-based society, so he can't advise it. Enji, however, still felt Toya could surpass All Might, whom he desperately wanted to catch up to.

She tells him that she is worried about him but he walks off, saying that his father was the one who lit the fire under him to surpass All Might. That night, Rei tries to tell Enji that the choice he wants to make is too cruel, especially since Toya knows what he wants from his children. Enji tells her that no matter what he says he keeps coming home with fresh burns everyday, lamenting that his son also inherited his stubbornness. He tells her it is the only way to make him give up because he will never be able to surpass All Might.

He lit the fire in him to surpass All Might and it is not going out, just as he calls him by his hero name rather than "father".

One night, he vents to a sleeping Natsuo, telling him that he acknowledges it was his fault for attacking Shoto, who did nothing wrong, but he adds that Enji is to blame as well by not paying attention to the three of them because they are "failed creations" and asking if this is what modern day Heroes do with their kids. Natsuo drowsily tells Toya to bother Fuyumi about this stuff, causing Toya to become upset that Natsuo is ignoring him.

She tells him that there are other paths and options for him and to look beyond his father, positive he will become the man he wants to become. Toya angrily asks what she knows and where she got that advice, causing Rei to freeze in shock at his intensity.

Shortly afterwards, Toya approaches Enji and tells him to come to Sekoto Peak on his next day off so he can show off his progress to him. Enji suspects something and lifts up his shirt, shocked to see his burn scars, angry that he had been hiding them on purpose. Toya starts tearing up and pulling out his hair, telling Enji that what he can do now is really cool and perhaps he will be as awesome as Shoto and stronger than All Might one day, and then he will have to give him respect and be happy he made him. Frustrated, he hits Rei and yells at her for not stopping Toya, causing Shoto to yell at him to not bully her while his siblings are forced to listen on and Enji tells Shoto to stay out of it.

In the Villain hideout, Dabi thinks back to when he lost control of his fire, engulfing the entirety of himself and the mountains in flames, but he still blames Enji since he only ever taught him how to increase his output.

   Enji tells his family that he should have just given up everything that day, but since he felt he killed Toya, he believed he had no choice but to keep moving forward with Shoto, no matter the cost. Rei reveals that he got worse to the point where she couldn't look at him anymore and started to see his face in her children. Fuyumi confesses she knew of their problems but she was too scared to intervene, which is why she tried to fix things just to keep up appearances. Natsuo says Enji is the root of all their problems, but admits that if he had more courage, he could have knocked some sense into Enji to talk with Toya seriously and then Dabi would never have been born and they could have had a more healthy familiar relationship.

   Rei tells Enji that he isn't the only one responsible for Toya's fate, that all of them need to take responsibility for what comes next, and even though his heart is broken, they will help him get back on his feet because he has no choice but to fight Dabi. A stunned Enji asks if he is talking to his wife right now, and after a moment of silence, Rei says Shoto had suffered more than them and had every right to resent her, yet he called her "Mom" again. She also says he made friends at U.A. and is saving them, then calls Shoto their family's hero.

   Shoto weakly tells Enji that he talked with his mother before they came to see him because he initially thought he wouldn't be able to fight and that he'd have to do it himself, but he was wrong.

   Best Jeanist and Hawks walk into Endeavor's hospital room, asking to provide assistance, after overhearing their conversation right outside.

   Hawks notes it was a shock to learn the extent to how far Endeavor's obsession went. He approaches Shoto and asks if his burn mark was also his doing, but Rei jumps in to say it was her, which Shoto sullenly looks on in response. Hawks thinks back to his own family situation, and how he never got to face them and chose to give up and leave them behind, telling Shoto he's a "class act".

   After telling him his only option is to fight, Hawks and Best Jeanist gleefully respond that they'll be assisting him as a team-up with the top three, so he and his family don't have to take on the burden alone. Endeavor asks why they would, with Hawks thinking about how he knows things are different now regarding him, and that he wants to lend his full support to anyone trying to do better. Endeavor tearfully accepts their proposal and this new resolve to move forward. Natsuo mentions this is only until they stop Toya, which he agrees.

   Hawks gets right down to business, mentioning how due to Dabi's accusation they'll need to put out a statement to the public which he's been working on. However, he mentions one point he's unsure about and wants to learn first, asking Endeavor, "What is One For All?" Fuyumi recalls that when she, Natsuo, and Rei were first entering the hospital, they heard from the surrounding media asking about a mysterious phrase that Endeavor muttered during the battle referencing "One For All", and wondering if it is connected to All For One. As Hawks tells Endeavor he wants to know what it is, he thinks back to the fight with Tomura and how he said he was looking for One For All, remembering Deku saying that Tomura was targeting him, and suggests that he might know.

Tenya mentions that All Might asked to be alone with him for now, causing Hawks to ponder.

   Izuku re-emerges in the vestige world, where most of the One For All users are sitting on chairs ready to talk with him, with the second and third users facing the wall behind them. All For One's brother, the first user, mentions how originally they were only able to interact with Izuku during specific instances within his consciousness, but that in the last four months, the power has been growing exponentially, and has reached the point that the vestiges are now able to more freely communicate with each other, even more so after All For One's attempt to steal One For All.

   Daigoro Banjo reassures Izuku his privacy is safe, but then remembers he still doesn't have a mouth. However, Izuku realizes that his mouth has been slowly manifesting, and finds a way to communicate with the users through muffled speech. He is then approached by the fourth user,
   Hikage Shinomori
   , who mentions being shocked at Izuku's sudden emergence of his Quirk, Danger Sense. Daigoro pokes fun at Hikage for being a hermit who shunned society and lived alone, after which Hikage asks Izuku about his age and cause of death. Izuku recalls that he was forty and that All Might had scratched out his cause of death in the notebook, which Hikage reveals was "old age".
  </p>
  <p key="f8838526-71e0-4094-ab86-56d36789d47b">
   Hikage reveals that through All Might and his research, he realized that One For All is no longer able to be held by an "ordinary person". He continues that other than All Might, he possessed One For All the longest out of everyone, and that for eighteen years he evaded All For One while training his power in secret, knowing that he would never be able to beat him in his state, and just had to nurture it until someone else could. However, it was in his final years that the Quirk started to break his body. At first he believed it was some sort of disease, but after All Might rediscovered his medical history and autopsy, he realized the truth, that possessing multiple Quirks ate away at his life.
  </p>
  <p key="aec6dc21-3235-4d2f-bcd7-5bcf36787656">
   Izuku reacts in shock, but is confused considering how much longer All Might has held One For All for, and how much stronger it became for him. The first user adds that All Might realized this as well, and since there wasn't much to compare to other than himself, as all the other users died young and in battle, All Might wrongly suspected that One for All had some hidden limit that users of the Quirk could take before dying. The discrepancy with All Might led Hikage to wonder if there was something that All Might had that he didn't, Izuku realizes what the difference between Hikage and All Might was: All Might was Quirkless.
  </p>
  <p key="a23a9c67-353d-417a-9e10-c0bba01a1b89">
   The first user explains that while All Might still lives, everything he learned was passed onto the other users through All Might's vestige, and it was through the encounter with All For One that their theories were confirmed. While they initially believed that the spirits of the predecessors resided within One For All, in truth, it was a result of the Quirk Factors of the second to seventh successors, with All Might being the sole exception due to being imbued with One For All as a true piece of his consciousness, as his only Quirk.

   He continues that a vessel with an existing Quirk could not receive One For All without it warping and spilling over, and attempting to force it results in a shortened lifespan, like what happened with Hikage, and that All Might managed to hold onto One For All for forty years because it perfectly fit his previously empty vessel, and became

   They conclude that due to these circumstances, the true value of the power can only be wielded by those who lacked power to begin with, with Izuku following up that especially now that the previous user's Quirks have started manifesting, One For All can not be given to someone with a Quirk. The first user says that due to Quirkless individuals vanishing rapidly after each generation, it was fate that Izuku managed to be the one who was bestowed the power, and that if they had a way to contact him sooner, they could've prevented people from dying. Daigoro adds that because of this, Izuku may end up being the

   After Izuku's contemplation of this revelation, Nana turns to him, asking if he can kill Tomura Shigaraki, clarifying it isn't a request, but a question of his resolve. She reminds him of their last interaction and that since all of the inheritor's are connected to his emotions, they could sense that he saw him as someone who needed saving. Daigoro says that he and the other users don't feel the same way, and that even if Tomura is suffering under All For One, that doesn't necessarily mean he would want their help, since even they could see his eyes were still filled with hate.
  </p>
  <p key="cdb967e1-e4f2-4b6c-8217-7cdd5c3f5514">
   The first user says that his older brother purposefully raised Tomura this way, and now that All For One has taken over his body and mind, he believes this is part of another plan to claim One For All. Daigoro reveals that All For One had attempted to steal One For All from him and his successor,

   , twice, but failed, and that one must have an incredibly strong will and overbearing emotions in order to override the basic principle of One For All, which means All For One is using Tomura's hatred to complete the job. The inheritors tell Izuku that One For All was itself a powerful will meant to resist All For One, and that they have been cultivating it for the specific purpose of destroying him, which All Might succeeded in, but despite all that, he managed to return through Tomura.
  </p>
  <p key="8cb91e1f-f339-43ef-b142-f3abb503e190">
   Nana confronts Izuku, confirming to him that Tomura is her grandson, and that the reason he became this way is because she left his father at a young age to fight All For One, feeling all this is her fault. She knows how unfair it is to force this burden onto a young boy, but reminds him that if ‘that thing' ever reaches its potential and becomes the ultimate evil, no one will be able to stop him. She says that it won't be enough to forgive and understand him because some people cannot be saved, and that if Tomura is one of them, a person who looks like they need saving but can't, does he have the resolve to stop him at all cost?
  </p>
  <p key="d3a9a3d4-b4d2-4251-843f-17e98079be06">
   After a moment of silence, Izuku says that when Tomura's conscience manifested in One For All, he felt what he was feeling when he was told to think about his aspirations, and in the deepest part of his mind, he could feel and see the image of Tomura, as Tenko, crying. Izuku admits he has fought many people so far, and it was unavoidable because they never backed down, however also mentioning he never pinpointed what drove them to becoming Villains, and wonders that if he did, maybe things could have been different and their fights could have been resolved another way.

  <p key="2f9dc66c-95b7-4c8a-967b-7e2d4f6bd0db">
   He knows that countless people died and many of his friends were hurt because of Tomura, but he stands his ground believing that One For All is a Quirk meant to save lives, not kill; that All Might taught him that, and that he and all the other users who have helped grow and cultivate the power, have in the process saved and brought hope to countless people. He understands that while its origins were to destroy All For One, because all of them have risked their lives to maintain the power, its purpose has changed and morphed all this time. He accepts the real possibility that Tomura can only be stopped by killing him, and he doesn't know how he will deal with everything exactly yet, but he still wants to try and save "that little boy", all the while briefly transforming into his child self.

  <p key="064f3f3f-f515-4a49-b514-d9d4ba36d47b">
   The first user happily accepts Izuku's answer, telling him that he and the others will be there for him, and that he's grateful that he and All Might inherited their power, as he comforts the crying vestige of All Might. He then comforts Nana as she apologizes for testing him like this, telling him to give her best to Gran Torino when he wakes up, admitting that while they made the wrong choice, their successors are determined to make things right. The first user then looks towards the second and third inheritors and asks them to play nice and cooperate with Izuku, as he'll need their help to unleash the Quirk's full power.

   All Might continues to sense Izuku's conversation within One For All, when he is approached by Hawks and Best Jeanist. He tells them Izuku will be up soon as the three go to chat while some of the classmates check in on him. Hawks questions All Might about the connection between One For All and Izuku, because several of the heroes who retired had overheard the name during the battle, mentioned it to the media who has begun spreading it around, and that Endeavor told him that Tomura was targeting Izuku.

Endeavor reveals the full truth behind Dabi's confessional of his and his family's past, to mixed results from viewers. Hawks proceeds to clarify to the confused press that despite Best Jeanist's death being faked so he could infiltrate the League of Villains as a spy, all of the rest of the allegations are true. He apologizes for concealing the connection to his criminal father, while also saying he felt he had no other choice but to kill Twice as his Double Quirk would've been too dangerous if left unchecked, and he felt ashamed he wasn't able to properly stop him.

Best Jeanist adds that due to the significant amount of heroes resigning, it's become harder to protect the public so they have started a plan for help protecting the civilians.

The press then proceed to ask about what One For All is, which Endeavor simply says he doesn't know, so to protect Izuku and All Might. Back at Heights Alliance, all the members of Class 1-A are surprised by personalized letters from Izuku, confessing the truth behind One For All, how All For One and Tomura are after him, and that he must leave because of it.
