He switches his power between arms so All For One will miss and then smashes his mask with a left hook.

Overhaul tells the League of Villains that there is no king of light or darkness anymore. Tomura claims that he will become the next king of evil and Overhaul asks what his plan is.

   While Skeptic's puppets were trying to restrain Twice, the Villain received a broken arm, confirming for him that he was the real one and not a clone as his past trauma had caused him to question. Twice had regained the confidence in his ability to duplicate himself. Twice began creating clones of himself, who made clones of themselves and so on, creating a literal one man army.
   This gave the original Twice the opportunity to give Himiko medical attention.

   A Twice clone made it to the tower where the army's supreme leader was observing the battle and where Giran was being held. The Twice clone created duplicates of himself and the other League members. But the supreme leader dealt with them fairly easily using his

   The supreme leader survived the fall and engaged in battle with Tomura, using a greater level of his Quirk. By that time, Gigantomachia had arrived and began destroying everything in his path.
  </p>
  <p key="8a2c1a80-a3c1-4514-ac27-13f224c26252">
   The supreme leader gained the upper hand against Tomura and tried to tear his finger off one by one. At that point, Tomura's Quirk underwent an Awakening, allowing him to disintegrate things without need all five fingers. The supreme leader immediately dropped him for fear of being crumbled to dust.
  </p>
  <p key="88ae1c10-6b62-47bf-83dd-e589d867727e">
   Tomura began to remember his repressed childhood memories and was able to achieve a greater level of power because of it. Tomura was able to spread his destructive effect across the entire city. The supreme leader, even with support equipment to increase the strength of his Quirk, was unable to combat the Awakened Tomura. The supreme leader would have died had he not amputated his own legs.
  </p>
  <p key="f6493a22-4add-42dc-81f3-9b1ecf6682cb">
   In the aftermath of the fight, Trumpet and his soldiers raced over to rescue their leader, but the supreme leader ordered them to stand down, acknowledging that the Army had lost. Gigantomachia had seen the whole thing and began to accept Tomura as the successor of All For One.

  <p key="846032d9-a045-43d4-ab16-dcbc327c7a3c">
   The League agreed to spare the Army, but in exchange, the Army must become subservient to the League.
   The supreme leader agreed; and so the League of Villains and the Meta Liberation Army merged and became the Paranormal Liberation Front.

  <p key="4eb3fe8f-1bff-4ff4-91e0-28d9cd57e847">
   The League of Villains is the most powerful villain organization in the criminal underworld. It was organized by All For One, a man who ruled the Japanese criminal empire for decades and prepared the League specifically for Tomura.
  </p>
  <p key="f5f3879f-3cda-4b21-8480-31faedff7ca6">
   Initially, the League of Villains ranks were made up of a large number of weak villains and a single Nomu that could challenge All Might. Their bold attack on the U.S.J. ultimately failed and their numbers dwindled down to just Tomura and Kurogiri. After Stain inspires a new wave of villains to join the alliance, the League of Villains becomes a much more formidable organization.
  </p>
  <p key="6cd89ffb-dc93-408b-bd5b-0ad9928df730">
   Tomura gains strong new allies and forms the Vanguard Action Squad with Dabi as its leader. They are able to take on a team of Pro Heroes and U.A. Students while accomplishing their mission to capture Katsuki. However, this comes at the cost of A-Rank villains Muscular and Moonfish.
  </p>
  <p key="3a524c2d-325b-49b1-8cbc-aff8d579f664">
   The League of Villains takes an even larger hit once All For One gets arrested, but they slowly rebuild their strength. Gigantomachia's recruitment and the development of new, more powerful Nomu like High-End have boosted the alliance's ranks. They possess destructive fighters like Tomura and Dabi as well as espionage specialists like Himiko and Twice. Giran's support and Mr. Compresses brains are also essential to the organization. The League took a blow with the death of big sis Magne and the incarceration of Kurogiri.
  </p>
  <p key="9b493f9d-2865-4655-ace9-4c47b2924f44">
   The League of Villains have proven to be the greatest threat to Hero Society as the world knows it. They are responsible for All Might's retirement and several assaults on U.A. High School, the pillars of Hero Society. The League of Villains appears to be the group primed to capitalize on the fall of the Symbol of Peace and rise up as the new rulers of society.
