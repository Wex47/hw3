   After that first impression, Katsuki does not hesitate to say that Endeavor is a jerk, although he will put up with it if that means he can see how the top hero operates. Katsuki's attitude displeases Endeavor and asks Shoto if he really is his friend. Izuku, on the other hand, thanks Endeavor for taking them in and notices how much calmer the Flame Hero appears now compared when they met during the

   While they walk down the street, Endeavor remarks the words that Izuku said to him at the Sports Festival, about Shoto is not like him. Suddenly, Endeavor runs off saying that he won’t be wasting time training others than Shoto. He then leaps into action, as he hears a disturbance. Endeavor tells the interns to stand back and watch if they want to learn. To his surprise, the three young students put on their gear as they follow him, with Izuku asking him for his instructions. Endeavor repeats his order to stay behind him.

   Meanwhile, there is a ruckus across the city caused by the mysterious

   In a business district, Starservant continues with his speech about the end of the world as he floats through the streets using his Quirk. The civilians see him as more of a nuisance than as a threat as they go about their business. Starservant continues preaching and tells the citizens to flee before he clashes with darkness. Starservant suddenly starts absorbing the glass from the windows in the area, gathering the glass into a giant sphere to prepare his super move,

   Before he can harm anyone, Endeavor appears and shatters the gigantic sphere with his

Fearing the head of Endeavor's flames, Starservant bails out and flees down an alleyway, with Endeavor tailing him behind. When they are about to come out of the other end, the Starservant calls for his minions, ready to ambush Endeavor.

   As the minions are about to strike the No. 1 hero from the corner, Izuku and Katsuki charge in ready to attack them, but Hawks suddenly appears and defeat all Starservant's subordinates by himself effortlessly. Uninhibited, Endeavor tackles Starservant to the ground and restrains him. Shoto arrives as Izuku and Katsuki recover. Hawks apologizes to the kids for being faster and says Endeavor looked like he was in trouble. Endeavor denies that and tells Hawks he is supposed to contact him if he wants to meet, and Hawks claims he was just passing by.

Hawks gives him the book asking him to make sure he reads it well. Endeavor notices that there is something off about Hawks' expression while he is offering him the book.

   In his office, Endeavor realized something was off from the way Hawks was acting compared to before.

Once he picks up that Hawks was faking, Endeavor decides to read the highlighted sections that Hawks specifically recommended to him.

He makes it clear that he still has not forgiven Endeavor, and tells him to stop trying to act like a father figure with him in front of his friends. Endeavor grieves at Shoto’s words. He thought Shoto was finally starting to forgive him, but it is clear that he completely mistook his son's intentions. After accepting this, he decides to start the training.

They should know their surroundings perfectly to detect the slightest disturbance, being the fastest to reach the scene and keep the damage to a minimum by keeping all civilians as far way as possible. With his training they will make these processes their M.O. Endeavor ends the lesson by telling Izuku, Shoto and Katsuki that, during the winter break, their task is to show him that they can defeat a villain faster than him.

Shoto asks Katsuki if he has noticed Endeavor's technique, and an annoyed Katsuki asks him what he thinks he noticed before him. Shoto tells that the reason why Endeavor is so fast is because shoots fire out off his feet to dash. Katsuki replies that the Flame Quirk use as a rip-off of his

   Once his sidekicks take care of the villain, Endeavor leaves immediately to continue his patrol, being followed by the students. This teaches them that they must be ready to go at it all by themselves. Don’t stop at one trouble, keep going and going. Endeavor instructs them that, although sometimes they can receive help from others, a

   After this, Endeavor assigns Katsuki and Shoto to work on their power. They must pick between learning to unleash maximum output for just a second or focusing their powers. Once they choose one option, they have to practice it repeatedly until they can do it without thinking.

   During a break, Endeavor asks Deku if he is able to max his output for a second subconsciously. Deku replies that with the Full Cowling he has no problems, but with the Air Force he still needs focus. Endeavor tells Deku to forget about his “secondary” ability for now and focusing only on using Air Force. When Deku asks about the parallel processes, Endeavor replies that everyone does that every day without even realizing, and uses a passing driver as an analogy. The driver was not born knowing how to drive a car, but received instructions of the individual steps to do so (steering, accelerating, braking, checking behind and ahead, etc…) until he was able to do them all at once without even thinking. Therefore, Endeavor advises him to learn to do two things at once subconsciously, and when he succeeds, throw in another thing.

Although they haven’t meet Endeavor’s expectation, they have grown stronger and more confidence in their abilities.

While patrolling and protecting the streets, Enji has another internal monologue that he only approaches his family as a hero, not as a father, and yet his daughter Fuyumi shares his hope that they will all reconcile with each other and become a real family. Endeavor thanks his daughter for all the support she has given him. After this, he orders his trainees to move on.

The tension builds between father and son, while Deku and Katsuki watch with awkward and concerned expressions.

He considers him responsible for the scar on his face, since it was his abuse that led his mother to hit him with the teapot during a breakdown, an action she instantly regretted. While he says he can't forgive him that easily, he acknowledges that his mother is trying to move on, but he himself is unsure.

  <p key="6664d1a2-a603-4c33-b595-fd71368d58b0">
   Endeavor responds by saying that Natsuo still came out for Fuyumi and Rei's sakes and that he was trying to respect the feelings of his sister who is trying so hard to fix the family that Endeavor broke, signifying that Endeavor sees Natsuo as kind enough. Endeavor then states that despite his efforts to fix his mistakes, he accepts the possibility that he can never forgive him for his negligence towards his family and the damage caused. Accordingly,  Endeavor's fine if Natsuo doesn't forgive him, because he's not looking for it, he just wants to atone for his mistakes. A teary-eyed Natsuo tells him that Fuyumi had been so happy lately, but every time he looks at his father, he thinks of everything in the past. He questions why he has to be the only one to try and proactively change and what exactly will Endeavor do to atone.
