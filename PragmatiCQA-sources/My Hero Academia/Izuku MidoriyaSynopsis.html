   . However, by the time children his age manifested their powers, Izuku still showed no signs of developing any special abilities. A doctor's visit revealed the devastating truth: Izuku has two joints in his pinky toe, a telltale sign that he was born Quirkless.
  </p>
  <p key="9db61cdc-5f9c-4c14-9675-0b02dfc7b570">
   Izuku had trouble accepting this at first and hoped for a miracle while he was still young. He tried desperately to use telekineses or breathe fire (his mother and father’s Quirks respectively), but to no avail. Izuku would eventually have to face reality: he was one of the very few people who would never develop a Quirk.
  </p>
  <p key="2d6b7287-4b3c-470e-a63f-18959a03adb5">
   Later on, Izuku kept watching videos of All Might that night on his computer and tearfully asked his mother if he could still become a hero. She hugged him and apologized, words that Izuku would remember as not what he wanted to hear because they made him feel inadequate to those with Quirks.
  </p>

  <p key="8f8efb96-d849-46ab-af01-93025c0086bd">
   However, things escalated when Izuku tried to help Katsuki after he fell off a small bridge into a stream. Izuku offered a helping hand, but Katsuki's pride caused him to take this as an insult. He believed that Izuku made him appear as if he needed aid from someone who is beneath him. This would strain the relationship between the two for years to come.

Katsuki tells Izuku that Heroes have had stories about them since their early school years, that only he is destined to reach that school and Izuku is just a stepping stone for his greatness. Before leaving class, Katsuki warns Izuku not to apply to U.A. at all.

   Suddenly, All Might's appearance drastically changes to a more skeletal form. All Might reveals to the shocked young man that he was injured in a battle five years ago and can only stay in his hero form for a short period of time. He goes on to tell Izuku that professionals must always put their lives at stake to save the day and thus cannot openly say whether it is possible to be a Hero without a Quirk as it may not be possible. All Might says that if Izuku cares about saving people, he can always go on to become a policeman, as in that way he can be responsible for putting the villains in jail (even though it is a ridiculing job). He tells Izuku that it is not bad to dream, but warns him not to obscure the facts and then leaves.

Izuku recognizes Katsuki as the victim being possessed by the Sludge Villain that had attacked him earlier and feels guilty that he might have accidentally let the villain escape from All Might's possession. Izuku, having looked at Katsuki's pleading eyes, rushes towards the villain, attempting to save Katsuki despite being Quirkless. As the Sludge Villain prepares to attack Izuku, All Might, inspired by the boy's action,
   shows up and defeats the villain
   before Izuku could get hurt.

   The Pro Heroes at the scene started berating Izuku for his reckless behavior. Katsuki became so mad that he was nearly saved by Izuku, that he caught up to him and told him that he was not saved by him at all before angrily walking away. All Might appeared and thanked Izuku for reminding him what it means to be a hero and then explained that what he did was what most top heroes did in their younger days, this made him tell Izuku that he can become a hero as he offered him the chance to become one.

However, because the entrance exam is so close, Izuku must hurry to the school without getting used to the power.

   Shota tells the student that, with a Quirk like One For All, Izuku will be nothing but a burden by putting himself in danger several times, and that if he does not find a way to prevent One For All from massively crippling his own body, Izuku's future as a hero will be put in jeopardy. Shota then allows Izuku a second chance for the pitch trial. Keeping Shota's words in mind, Izuku powers up only the end of one of his fingers and launches the ball at a considerable distance. He shocks his class with this display as he tells his teacher he is still standing as Shota is impressed with his feat.

However, after showing the results of the test, Shota reveals that he lied about the expelling in order to motivate the students to give their all, calling it a logical ruse, much to Izuku's shock.

   While Shota is leaving, he sees All Might, who tells Shota that he knows that he was actually planning to expel last place from U.A. All Might then concludes that Shota sees the same potential in Izuku that All Might sees. Shota shrugs off All Might's words and says that the chance of Izuku becoming a great hero is higher than zero, and that he does not see anything more than that, claiming to expel Izuku if he sees his chance ever fall below that mark.

Izuku explained his views of his name have just changed.

   As Katsuki is about to attack him again, Izuku intercepts him, grabs his right arm, and throws him to the ground, knowing that he would use his right arm to attack. Izuku tells the surprised Katsuki that he memorized his moves, as the same notebook Katsuki blew up and threw away in the past contained notes of heroes he has analyzed which include him. Izuku announces that he is no longer the "Deku" who was a loser, but the "Deku" whose vibe is never giving up, much to Katsuki's fury.

   Izuku stands firm that he wants to save everyone, and that they can do it without fighting, with Melissa saying that if they can get to the top floor of the tower, they can reset the security system and release everyone. Reinvigorated, everyone decides to work together to execute the plan. Izuku tries to tell Melissa to stay behind, but she refuses because she's the only one who can disable the security system, and wants to help save everyone just as much as Izuku. They relay the message to All Might, who mostly disapproves, but agrees that true heroes must act in situations like these, having faith in them.

The group ends up in the Plant Factory, where they hide when they notice the elevator carrying the villains making their way there. At this same moment, Eijiro and Katsuki appear, unaware of what is going on, leading to a confrontation between the two and the villains. Shoto stays behind to assist in the fight, using his Quirk to create an ice pillar that raises the others to the next floor.

Once on the 130th floor, they are faced with dozens of security bots. They attempt to destroy them with Denki's Quirk, but when that fails, they use a combination of their Quirks to destroy the blockade.

The three reach the wind power generation system, where Ochaco uses her Quirk to float Izuku and Melissa to the emergency exit at the top of the tower. Just as she is about to be attacked by more robots, she is saved by Katsuki, Shoto, and Eijiro who repel the robots. Katsuki and Shoto help readjust the wind turbines and air allowing Izuku and Melissa to get back on course, which Izuku achieves using a full power Detroit Smash.

The two are shocked to not only find David and Sam in the vault by themselves, but also overhear them working with the villains, leading to a confrontation. A tearful Melissa demands to know why her father did this, which he admits is because his device, one with the power to amplify Quirks, was taken and locked away by the island's sponsors, and that Sam provided him with the idea to hire fake villains to use as a distraction to steal it back. He further explains that he knows that All Might's Quirk is disappearing and that he wants to give it to him so that he can continue being the Symbol of Peace, leading Izuku to feel a tad guilty, since he knows the real truth.

Izuku catches up to Wolfram as he plans to escape in a helicopter. Wolfram taunts Izuku asking if he's there to rescue a criminal, with Izuku crying out he's there to rescue the professor. He grabs ahold of the helicopter attempting to take off trying to rescue David, but is attacked by a barrage of metal pillars that eventually slam him back onto the ground.

   Mei apologizes for the explosion she caused; she asks the Class 1-A trio for their names since she forgot them. Izuku, Ochaco, and Tenya remind Mei of their names. Izuku asks for a costume upgrade, which catches Mei's attention. Power Loader reminds Mei that he is fine with her working in the Development Studio but must not cause chaos, otherwise, he will ban her. Power Loader turns his attention to Izuku, Ochaco, and Tenya and invites them into the Development Studio.

  <p key="dc537c99-ac19-4ad7-999c-3d5d38ecadab">
   Inside the Development Studio, Izuku, Ochaco, and Tenya are amazed at all the machinery in it. Power Loader explains to the trio about hero costume upgrades; after looking at their respective costume instructions, he will be able to tinker with their costumes. If it is small improvements and fixes, all he needs to do is inform the design office about the changes, but if it is big improvements, he must prepare a formal written application to the design office to request approval. After the newly upgraded costume gets inspected and approved, it goes back to them. Power Loader tells the trio that the design office he is partnered with is one of the best, so any costume upgrades can be done within a mere three days.

   Izuku asks Power Loader if there is something that can reduce the stress on his arm ligaments; Power Loader replies that minor tinkering to his hero costume will make it possible. Suddenly, Mei inspects Izuku's body and makes him wear a powered exoskeleton, much to Izuku's discomfort. Izuku once again asks for simple arm support while Tenya asks for cooling capabilities for his legs. As Izuku watches Mei gives Tenya Super Cooler Electric Boosters. He hears her remark that Tenya he must run with his arms, which confuses Tenya. However, Mei's proverb makes Izuku realize what All Might was saying about him imitating him.

   Izuku suddenly realizes that his way of thinking has been wrong; people who invent are not bound by conventional thinking and in order to improve himself, he must think out of the box like Mei. While Mei helps out Ochaco, Izuku asks Tenya to help him with something.

   When Katsuki tests out his new special move called
   AP Shot
   on a rock, a move that creates an Explosion beam. Katsuki's AP Shot successfully executes and penetrates a rock but causes the rock to begin falling towards All Might. Suddenly, Izuku appears and destroys the rock with a kick. Izuku then destroys the remaining rock with another kick. All Might is impressed that Izuku figured out his advice on his own. Izuku has realized that just because he is the new successor of One For All, it does not mean that he must inherit his predecessor's fighting style, in this case All Might's punching style, and is free to choose his own fighting style.
  </p>
  <p key="96e2adab-f502-439c-93ee-baa7c4f63a0d">
   Taking Mei's words into consideration, and Tenya's help, Izuku has decided to forego All Might's punch fighting style and redevelop his own fighting style. The technique Izuku used to destroy the rocks is called

   U.A.'s recommendation entrance exam
   , the same year Class 1-A took it, Inasa received the top score and passed. However, despite receiving the top score, Inasa declined his admission offer. Izuku is surprised with Inasa's prowess and thinks that he might be as talented as Shoto.

   Camie charges at Izuku despite being nude and scratches him on his cheek, but before she can attack him again, Hanta and the real Ochaco arrive and force Camie to retreat.

The boy explains that they need to help prepare the situation so it goes smoothly when emergency responders arrive. Saying something like "this is bad" won't comfort the injured. Izuku realizes this is why All Might always smiles, and knowing the test's true purpose, Izuku tries again by smiling and using kind words to reassure him, which works.

His worries are confirmed as Katsuki states that he received his Quirk from All Might since he witnessed All For One's ability to steal Quirks and bestow them onto others as well as figuring out that All Might is an acquaintance of All For One, Katsuki hypothesized that All Might also has some form of Quirk transference because he has become weaker ever since coming to U.A. and meeting with Izuku. Seeing that Izuku is not denying anything, Katsuki knows that he is right about Izuku gaining All Might's Quirk.

Izuku questions the reason as Katsuki states its in order to gauge his talents and to vent out his anger after the Kamino Incident, believing that All Might's retirement was his fault.

Katsuki questions him on whether he has made any improvements in his Quirk but Izuku states he has not. Katsuki berates him for his lack of initiative, as he brings up Izuku's promise to surpass him before he leaves. Izuku is then called out by Yuga who shows him a new move he created though it causes him severe stomach problems. Seeing his state, Izuku asks the instructor for permission to Yuga away from to recuperate before he asks him what he meant in his message.

  <p key="508872df-b51b-4628-affc-6dc1678713ed">
   Yuga explained that he is aware of Izuku not being accustomed to his Quirk as the latter wonders if he found out his secret. However, Yuga reveals that he went through a similar experience as he details his childhood of having to wear a belt to prevent his powers from leaking out and how he noticed it was similar to Izuku's initial lack of control of his before they both overcame it. He then tells Izuku that he is not alone in hardships as its better to face them together or they will not excel.

   Hearing these words, Izuku realizes that Yuga's actions were not meant to scare him but to encourage him as he smiles and thank him for his support before Yuga suffers from another stomach problem. After this, Izuku and Yuga become good friends with some of the class noting on their frequent interactions.

   At U.A. High School, Class 1-A chooses to make a band and dance performance for the School Festival. The lively Mina begins to show off her dance moves while her classmates including Izuku, are stunned by her skill. Izuku is shown holding and presumably skimming through his notebook while observing Mina's movement carefully, mumbling various facts on the subject to himself. He later looks up rather solemnly and states that he should try it out. Mina responds by calling Izuku over to teach him a move named two stepping, as a surprised and awkward-looking Izuku goes to join her.
  </p>
  <p key="fed0ecd8-cfdd-4298-9698-73beeb5132a1">
   After everyone is in their seats, Shota announces the School Festival taking place soon, and the class is visibly amused. Due Class 1-A also has to participate, Shota orders them to pick out a program to perform at the festival. Izuku suggests a Hero Quiz, but his classmates also have their own ideas, and they don't reach an agreement. At night, because he needs extra classes to recover the lost hours due to Work-Studies, he cannot participate in the meeting of his colleagues at Height Alliance, who reach an agreement that his performance will be a musical performance. Still Izuku likes the idea.
  </p>
  <p key="a872d31b-f2ca-487e-b506-9c323fb4338f">
   Next day, Izuku is excused by Shota to go visit Eri, explaining to the class that the request to visit was exclusively for Izuku and Mirio. Once the two are in the room, Izuku apologizes for not seeing her earlier, while Mirio offers her a fruit basket. After setting it aside, Eri tells Izuku that while she was being saved, she never knew his name. Izuku quickly states his full and hero name, tacking alongside that she could refer to him as Deku, as it was shorter and easier to pronounce.
  </p>
  <p key="107abe64-c006-4d5a-b155-c625c211fd26">
   Eri then begins to blame herself for the severe injuries everyone involved sustained however, she is unaware that Sir Nighteye has passed away. Eri is guilty that Mirio lost his Quirk because of her, but Mirio tells Eri that she is not to blame and everyone is glad that she is safe, which comforts Eri.
  </p>
  <p key="c1f2f5fd-4289-4fee-a854-259b0d2bbe70">
   Suddenly, Izuku has an idea and asks Shota if Eri can come to the School Festival. Mirio explains to Eri that the School Festival is an occasion that U.A. High School hosts where there will be lots of events on display where people can enjoy themselves while tasting delicious food such as candied apples, which catches Eri's attention. As Shota calls Nezu to get his approval, Izuku asks Eri about his idea; Eri wants to get to know the people who saved her and agrees to go to the School Festival. Mirio comically adds on that he could take her on a supervised date, to which Izuku responds by curiously asking him what he meant.

  <p key="fdd76e29-3058-459d-8e28-05f182f6d9be">
   Izuku and All Might are situated in the break room, conversing about the festival. All Might then asks Izuku why he wanted to meet at such a busy time, and Izuku starts telling him about his recent internship, stating that he could only muster up about 20% of his strength if he was under duress. He then monologues about how if Eri weren't there, his movements would have been too predictable and he would have been immobilized immediately. Izuku reveals that, against long range attacks, he was useless. All Might reacts by telling him that he should have long ranged attacks as well, while Izuku is flustered and instantly puts himself down.
  </p>
  <p key="09aca584-e900-4db4-8897-46c610e6b6f2">
   The scene then switches over to a forested area of the school grounds, where All Might begins to teach him by having him bring out Full Cowl. Izuku's stance allows him to unleash an attack from where he is positioned, and he unleashes a monstrous burst of wind, known as shoot style. All Might congratulates him, and asks him to rethink through his journey. Izuku looks back on the six major steps he has accomplished. All Might states that, once Izuku's maximum limit had passed 15%, he had wanted to tell him that he was not always bringing out 100%.
  </p>
  <p key="31126d2d-cbd4-494b-ab35-e4a2370a8504">
   Izuku is struck with realization, that if All Might had continuously moved at 100%, he would have caused a devastating windstorm in the surrounding area. Izuku realizes that he cannot maintain 20% for long, so at the moment of impact, that is when he should briefly release an amount close to his limit.

   Izuku continues dancing practice with the dancing team for the School Festival, he confuses Mina's instructions and has to be corrected. Then Mirio arrives at U.A. escorting Eri for a visit to show her around. Izuku joins them and the trio walk around U.A. admiring what all the different groups of students are preparing for the Festival. He then asks Eri to come and watch him at the Festival and that they will all work extra hard to make sure she has fun. From this visit he knows that allowing the festival to be held, Nezu agreed to increase security and to suspend all activities if alarms sound, even if it is a false alarm.

   A week later, Mina tells Izuku he is being switched over to the Staging Team from the Dancing Team, to help maneuver Yuga during his part of the presentation. He is selected since he and Yuga have been getting along as of late. Realizing he will still be able to perform, he accepts the change in position.
  </p>
  <p key="263dc6c1-3f50-4b77-ab9a-e9255bc840e8">
   Later on, he and All Might are out training in the forest before Mei appears while following one of her gadgets, that All Might caught. Izuku is noticed by Mei who tells him the item that he requested is similar to one of her inventions and is customizing it for his use, to which he thanks her. As Mei leaves, Izuku explains to All Might that he requested an item to help him with his new move.

   All Might surprises Izuku by revealing that once he also used support equipment, but since it wasn't effective to him, he chose to fight relying on his own body. That night, in Height Alliance, while his classmates enjoy " Gold Tips Imperial" tea brought by Momo, Izuku searches obsessively online with his phone for videos of All Might using the articles, but finds nothing, and accidentally taps on a video on black tea by

   The night before the festival, Class 1-A practice their routine but are accosted by

They go back to their dorm and there Yuga and Izuku find that the rope they will be using to suspend Yuga in mid-air for his part in the routine is now frayed. Not wishing to disturb Momo who had gone to sleep, Izuku says he will go buy a new rope from a store early next morning, as he also has something else he wants to pick up.

   Early next morning, Izuku is training when appears to tell him his new gloves (she had designed for him to use Shoot Style with) are complete and gives them to him. He is given the instruction manual for them and thanks Mei before she runs off. Toshinori asks him to test them, with which Izuku agrees.

   Izuku was practicing to get used to the gloves until he is almost out of time. At 7:50 AM,
He rushes to the market and gets the items he needed while still wearing the gloves. At 8:30, Izuku hurries back to the U.A., after buying everything he needed. On his way back however, he runs into the disguised duo of Gentle Criminal and

   This grabs Gentle's attention, who cannot help praising him for being so knowledgeable about tea despite his youth. From that conversation, the disguised Gentle realizes that Izuku is a U.A. student, and after noticing that he made a blunder for talking too long, he and La Brava try to leave. Too late, Izuku recognizes Gentle as the criminal from the videos he saw with Ochaco and deduces that he is trying to do something at the U.A., so he begs him not to attack the festival. Gentle asks La Brava to start recording. It is 8:32 AM until the School Festival begins.

   Gentle tries to convince Izuku to let him continue with his plan, because all he wants is to infiltrate the festival, not harm anyone, but Izuku refuses because his actions would cause the cancellation of the festival for which everyone has worked so much, and with which he tries to make Eri smile again.

   Izuku charges at a fleeing Gentle, until the latter starts bouncing around Izuku at great speed by turning the construction beams around him into elastic. Izuku shoots Gentle another air blast, but the villain uses his Quirk to make the attack rebound, hitting Deku himself. Then, to distract Deku, Gentle uses his Quirk to make one of the steel beams fall, forcing Deku to jumps in the way of the steel beam to catch it to keep it from crushing a bystander underneath him.

Gentle dodges Izuku's attack and notes his tenacity.

   Izuku puts down the steel beam that was holding and chase the villains, using the same elasticized crane's hook to slingshot himself towards the villains. Using his Quirk, Gentle and La Brava land safely in the forest area that surrounds the school, but Izuku appears above them, ready to shoot another air blast. Gentle raises an elastic invisible barrier to protect himself and La Brava from the attack, it but does not occur. Instead, Izuku uses the same aerial trampolines Gentle created to gets behind him and aims precisely to shoot at his barriers to ricochet his attack right at Gentle.

Wanting to end the battle quickly and while apologizing to Izuku, the powered up Gentle delivers an enhanced karate chop to the back of his neck, but Izuku manages to block his attack with his arm. Izuku tells Gentle he's fought stronger and faster people that himself and he haven't lost yet and prepares to attack Gentle.

   Much to Izuku's shock, it is revealed that the first user had intentionally shared his memory with him. When the first user interacts with him, Izuku realizes that he is experiencing something All Might had told him was impossible. The brother notes he wanted to show Izuku more but Izuku's current level won't permit it, though he assures Izuku that he is not alone, and the latter wakes up. Izuku is found on the floor by Yuga who finds the room a mess and Izuku with a glowing arm.

   Following his dream, Izuku is questioned by Yuga on the state of his room but he excuses it and goes on a jog, unable to fall back asleep after his dream. He recalls the last part of his dream, when All For One's brother reached out to touch his hand and all of the past users of One For All were looking directly at him.

   He later meets All Might in the U.A. nap room, Izuku tells him about his dream. All Might tells Izuku that he also experienced similar visions. His master told him that they are vestigial remnants of the prior generations of One For All rather than the usual simple dreams. He also tells Izuku that she taught him the impossibility of the prior generations communicating with him, which likely makes Izuku the first user of One For All to experience this phenomenon.

   However, All Might recalls a discussion with his master, where she told him that even if she dies, they will meet again within One For All. Izuku asks All Might about what All For One's brother meant by the "singularity"; after another question about the fuzzy appearance of All Might and two other prior users in the dream, All Might tells Izuku that he truly does not understand what happened that well and they should search for answers together. Izuku agrees to try his best and tells All Might that his master was very beautiful.

   Finally, the fifth round comes. The two teams head towards their respective starting points, with a Full-Cowled Izuku leaping forward while Ochaco, Mina, and Minoru walk on discussing their plan. Ochaco and Mina gloomily believe that they're at a heavy disadvantage, as all of them have more physical Quirks and are therefore vulnerable to Class 1-B's long-range attacks. Deku appears and cheers them up.

   Neito then starts questing Izuku about his strategy and taunts the latter for not staying with his team for cooperation purposes. Neito comments that his team must've ambushed 1-A with the help of Hitoshi's powers, even to the point of sadistically taunting Katsuki in his involvement for ending All Might's career as No. 1 hero. This prompts an enraged Izuku to charge at Neito, preparing to unleash a concentrated Delaware Smash.

   Hitoshi removes his mask and asks Izuku if they can have their proper rematch. Hearing this Izuku confirms the offer and allows himself to fall under Hitoshi's spell once again. The mysterious black power disappears as he loses consciousness and his powers deactivate. While unconscious, he finds himself in an unknown area and hears a loud voice calling him, revealed to be one of the former users of One For All; a bald man wearing goggles and a black jacket with a silver belt. The user tells Izuku that although his Quirk has finally manifested, he's using it in a wrong way. Izuku is also told that he needs to stop activating his power with such as idle thoughts. The man then encourages Izuku to try harder to control the Quirk.

   He also explains that the Quirk factors of all the previous wielders have been inside One For All for a long time, dormant, in the small core of the Quirk. He says that this core has started expanding and growing larger, and that the same is also happening to One For All itself. The successor also says that its strength has also been increased due to the power of One For All, and, after he tells Izuku to do his best, and that all the predecessors are there with him and are supporting him, he vanishes.

   Neito throws a projectile at Izuku and Ochaco, but the latter deflects it with her wrist-guard. As Neito's touched Izuku and therefore copied his Quirk, he attempts to activate One For All but it doesn't appear to work, allowing Ochaco to jump on him and swiftly pin him down.

   Hitoshi realizes his teammate's been caught and calls out to him, readying his binding cloth to use to support Neito, but Izuku uses Ochaco's Quirk to float up to his position above the battlefield, distracting him from his captured teammate. They both start grappling and Hitoshi reminds Izuku of their last bout, and Izuku knows Hitoshi is too big of a threat not to neutralize now. Hitoshi claims he's not the same as before and tries to bring the pipes down on Izuku the same way he did in round one.
  </p>
  <p key="0971acea-812c-4a83-a8b3-eaabd7a2f958">
   Izuku recalls the short time he spent in One For All after falling under Hitoshi's brainwashing. He spoke to a former One For All user and was told to use his new Quirk, Blackwhip, by keeping his heart under control. This man reminded Izuku of All Might, and that gives him enough heart to focus and use the black tendrils to suspend the pipes in the air.
  </p>
  <p key="bc3d3ae4-bf5c-4359-bced-6e56bdb4ede0">
   Hitoshi is surprised by this new development and asks if Izuku was only faking being in pain before. Izuku suddenly gets some painful physical backlash for using Blackwhip, realizing his body isn't ready for its power yet and he must master One For All first. To avoid another outburst, Izuku adjusts full cowl to 8%.

   Izuku spins off a wall to completely evade Hitoshi's Capturing Weapon. He remembers his origin and this gives him enough courage to use his Quirk without fear. Ochaco chops Reiko's neck to subdue her from behind and then pushes Yui into a trap made of Minoru's hair balls, which gives Mina an opening to uppercut Nirengeki to save Minoru. At the same time, Izuku pins down Hitoshi, reminding his team of the claim for a victory that he made before the match began.

   Before adjourning, Shota questions Izuku about the new move he used with everyone else interested too. Izuku claims that he isn't sure what it was, describing how his power overflowed and saying that he didn't know why the tendrils suddenly appeared. He thanks Hitoshi and Ochaco for saving him, Midnight continues the feedback by commending Hitoshi and Ochaco's heroism, mentioning how it "turns her on" in terms of excitement and passion. Mina also adds on that Ochaco did latch herself onto Izuku's body to prevent him from losing control. Both Izuku and Ochaco began to blush rapidly in embarrassment.

   However, Hitoshi reveals that he didn't save Izuku out of benevolence nor Ochaco's orders, but only because he wanted to fight his old rival and win a satisfying victory. As Hitoshi admits that he acted on his own desires, Shota proceeds to scold his pupil, much to the shock of Izuku and Ochaco. Shota points out that everyone in the Hero Course trained hard to become a hero, and they can't help others if they don't have the will to act on their own, commending Hitoshi for demonstrating the demeanor of a real hero.

   Later, he has a conversation with All Might and Katsuki about the Blackwhip. Katsuki asks All Might how he knew about using previous wielders' Quirk, but All Might admits that he knows nothing. Then he asks Izuku if there was a trigger that caused Blackwhip to manifest, but the latter denies and wondering if there could've been some form of external catalyst. Katsuki theorizes that maybe this turn of events has anything to do with All For One.

   Around 7:00 PM at evening, Izuku and Katsuki engage in a sparring match at Gym Gamma to activate the Blackwhip ability, but nothing happens, so All Might stops the fight. Calming down, Izuku realizes that the Quirk has been locked away and won’t emerge. He starts to mumble to himself how since the power is connected to his feelings, and he had decided that Blackwhip was too powerful to handle right now, he had mentally locked it away and can’t access it currently.

   Izuku and Katsuki return to their dormitories, where the students of Class 1-A mingle with the students of Class 1-B. Once there, Shoto stops to converse with him by asking Izuku if he has two Quirks like him and if he was still hiding his power during their fight at the Sports Festival. Izuku hurriedly replies that the black tendrils might be an extension of his original Quirk, and he wasn't holding back against him. Shoto believes him.

   The next day, Eri, Izuku, Mirio and Neito are standing outside the teaching staff dormitories. Shota wants Neito to copy Eri's Rewind Quirk, and Deku and Mirio are with her because he does not want to leave Eri alone with Neito, as his eccentric personality would be bad for her mental health.

   Inside the building, Neito attempts to copy Eri's Rewind Quirk. He grows the horn that is required for its usage, but says that he is incapable of using the Quirk itself and apologizes for this to Shota. When Mirio and Izuku question the reasons Neito explains that Rewind is an accumulation-type Quirk. He can copy the fundamental abilities of a Quirk, not something requiring stored-up energy as he cannot copy what has already been stored. This is why he could not use Deku's Quirk after copying it, because is an accumulation-type Quirk too. Izuku is relieved that he has this mechanism as it prevented him from being damaged by One For All.

  <p key="9e4d3638-3f67-47c1-aba9-7a434f20faca">
   Shota explains to Mirio and Izuku that as Eri doesn't understand how to properly use her power, he hoped that Neito's

   Quirk would help her and make it easier for her to learn it as well. Eri feels sad and apologizes for causing everyone trouble, saying everyone would be better off if she didn't have her ability, but Izuku reminds her that it was her power that saved him, stating that what she said is not true at all. He explains that what power is worth is all about how it's used, comparing it to how a knife is dangerous initially, but when used right can make all kinds of food, and saying that her power is an amazing one. These words encourage Eri, and she says that she'll try her best after all. Internally, Izuku promises himself that he'll master One For All.

For this reason, their work on the island basically involve mostly minor deeds.

   Later on the night, Izuku is practicing his kicks to keep training on the One For All. He thinks about his Quirk and how he can train himself to be able to use this power that All Might has given him. Coming back from his patrol, Katsuki finds Izuku training and tells him to hurry and master his Quirk. They are interrupted by Katsuma, who tells them a villain has appeared in the castle ruins.

   Izuku arrives in time to the place and rescues the kids from Nine, using his Quirk to escape through a forest area and get the kids to safety. Izuku tells them to run away while he faces Nine in the forest area.

   Inspired by Izuku and Katsuki's words, the class thinks back of all how their hard work they've done for the people and is now determined to do the same as Izuku and Katsuki. The whole class, unanimously agrees to fight the villains and protect everyone on the island. Izuku devises a plan of action for the class: by relocating all the civilians to mount Shiroyama in the smaller island where the ancient castle is located, it can hold all of the residents in the large cave safely. This way, the villains only have one route to get to Katsuma and everyone has an escape route if needed.

   The heroes will engage the villains using the terrain to their advantage and spit the villains apart, so each member has to face several students alone. After his previous fight against Nine, Izuku concludes that Nine cannot use his multiple Quirks for too long as he suffers from intense pain when he does. To deal with Nine, everyone will attacks him in waves to force Nine to use his Quirks all the time until he reaches his limit and cannot continue fighting.

   The next morning, Nine and his crew arrive at the entrance to the island. They fall into Class 1-A's trap and are forced to split up by Yuga and Momo's Ultimate Moves; and as planned, the students take turns attacking him to force him to use his Quirks as much as possible. Despite their attempts to stop him, Nine gradually defeats the students, until it's Izuku and Katsuki's turn to face him. As the villain is about to defeat them, he reaches his limit and starts to reel in pain from his illness. Izuku and Katsuki seize the opportunity, but Nine activates his life-support to take a heavy dose of empowering drug and goes beyond his limit, summoning a massive lightning strike that seemingly vaporized Izuku and Katsuki.

He holds Mahoro hostage and threatens to kill her if Katsuma doesn't surrender his quirk. Katsuma runs towards Nine to save her but Nine tosses Mahoro to the side and tries to steal Katsuma's Quirk. Before he can do it, Izuku and Katsuki enter the fray to save the children. Izuku kicks Nine's face, and the force of the blow throws the villain several meters away from Katsuma. Then he apologizes to the little boy for the delay and praises him for his bravery. As the kids flee to safety, Deku and Katsuki proceed to fight Nine.

   Izuku and Katsuki gain the advantage after Nine is reaching his limits of using his multiple Quirks and overwhelms him with a combination of Detroit Smash and Explosion. On the verge of defeat, Nine uses the entire empowering drug in his life-support system which amplifies all his Quirks to the maximum and proceeds to decimate Izuku and Katsuki with his

   With the entire class down and wounded, Izuku makes the desperate risk; he transfers One For All to Katsuki, breaking the grip from Nine. Infuriated, Nine attempts to kill them by summoning another massive firestorm on the island, destroying much of the island's infrastructure. Katsuki reaches One For All: Full Cowl - 100% and together with Izuku, they use Detroit Smash to stop the storm.

   Nine is just shocked by what he just witnessed, still he refuses to give up on fulfilling his dreams, and engages Izuku and Katsuki in intense combat, releasing all his Quirks at their maximum power. After a lengthy fight, Izuku and Katsuki finally manage to defeat Nine once and for all using the Explosion Quirk combined with St. Louis Smash at 100%, effectively ending the threat. Both heroes pass out. As Izuku loses consciousness, he thanks the One For All for everything as its last embers are extinguished inside him.

   After Class-1-A emerged victorious over the threat, the military and a large number of heroes arrive on Nabu Island, rescuing the civilians, medically treating Class 1-A, and putting the villains into custody. All Might recovers the barely conscious Izuku and the unconscious Katsuki. He cradles Deku in his arms and says he did well, as Izuku asks if Katsuki is okay. Deku then starts crying as he apologizes to All Might for giving One For All to Katsuki because he had no other choice to protect the people on the island, before losing consciousness.

All Might says it's a miracle, but perhaps the predecessors willed it for Izuku to hold this power. All Might then thanks his master Nana as well as the predecessors for returning One For All back to Deku. All Might takes both boys to be healed. Later, they are healed by Recovery Girl and Katsuma.

  <p key="bd523a89-890b-452f-ab33-f9becf7aaa6d">
   Izuku is aware that all this is due to the years of abuse and neglect by Endeavor towards his children. He also discovers that Katsuki is also aware of the situation, and when he asks him if he knew about Shoto's past, to which he reveals he was listening when the two of them were talking during the Sports Festival.
  </p>
  <p key="bd50e049-6344-41a4-81bf-6644ce05b2f2">
   Although it is clear that Endeavor regrets what he did and now tries to do his best for his family, it's hard for his children to forgive him. Izuku tells Shoto that he feels he's getting ready to forgive Endeavor, as he feels that if Shoto truly hated him, it would be fine to not forgive him, but Izuku voices his thoughts on that Shoto is a very kind person waiting for the right moment to do it.

  <p key="9ad115c4-acf1-49e9-a305-417563580696">
   Fuyumi and Shoto tell Izuku and Katsuki about their older bother Toya, and how close he was to Natsuo, to the point he blames Endeavor for Toya's death. Fuyumi then says that an incident occurred after their mother was hospitalized, which only made things worse. Although family relationships have improved a lot, there are still many wounds to heal. Endeavor then comes in and tells the three of them that he'll be taking them to U.A. High. As the three of them thank Fuyumi for the meal, Fuyumi thanks Izuku for being Shoto's friend.

   While
   Endeavor's chauffeur
   drives them back to the U.A, Endeavor tells the boys that they will have to keep going to his Agency to continue the training on weekdays and weekends if their schedule allows. Just then a villain appears in the middle of the road, holding Natsuo as a hostage and calls out Endeavor to come to face him. Endeavor leaps out the car to save his son. The villain, introducing himself as

   Ending takes a step back when he sees the interns, giving Endeavor an opportunity to attack the off-balance villain. However, when he sees Natsuo being held in front of Ending, Endeavor slows down, not wanting to endanger him, and allowing the three students to past him in order to rescue Natsuo and defeat the villain.

   As Izuku sees all the cars on the road flying in the air, he jumps into the air using Delaware Smash Air Force while thinking back to what Endeavor said about doing things subconsciously and successfully unleashes Blackwhip, saving all the cars while yelling that he won't let any of Ending's wishes come true, thus proving that his internship with Endeavor bore its fruit. The shocked Ending is then defeated by a fire-covered punch from Shoto.

   Shoto restrains Ending with his ice and the civilians who were saved express their gratitude to Izuku. He checks to make sure if any of the people were injured and claims to the other two that this was a complete victory for themselves. As Natsuo thanks Izuku and Katsuki, he asks Katsuki what his Hero Name is. When Izuku questions if it's just 'Bakugo', Katsuki denies it, revealing that he's picked a hero name for himself. Izuku and Shoto ask what it is but Katsuki refuses, instead wanting to tell someone else first.

   During the Work Studies, Endeavor takes Izuku, Shoto, and Katsuki to a facility to be evaluated. Once there, the Flaming Hero and representatives of the
   World Heroes Association
   explain to them that they will put on a test to check if they can fit to participate in an upcoming mission of global scale. To achieve it, they will face against Endeavor where they must land a single attack on him in a 3-minute limit to pass the test. Izuku is a little nervous about having to face Japan's Number 1 Hero, but he wants to participate in the international mission.
  </p>
  <p key="6f466695-cfe3-4567-8a0c-e8c6305dc043">
   The test begins and the three students attack Endeavor. Izuku tries to take advantage of the maze like arena to strike Endeavor from behind, but is unsuccessful. He, Katsuki, and Shoto then try to attack him at the same time, but Endeavor just blasts them all away with his Hellflame Quirk. The examiners ask the hero to go easy on the students as they don't expect them to be a match for him, but Endeavor replies to them not to underestimate his trainees. The three students get up, and after trying again, they each manage to hit Endeavor. Izuku is the one to get a Smash in on him, just before the time limit ends.
  </p>
  <p key="575c6a5f-1222-426e-829c-aadf2f6da4a0">
   The three of them pass, and Izuku writes in his notebook about their progress in the fight. Due to the nature of the mission they are going to participate in, they are taken to a room where they can create stealth-oriented suits. Izuku gets too excited and wants a cape like All Might's, but also worries he's not worthy of one. Annoyed at his attitude, Katsuki berates him for the idea of wearing a cape on a stealth mission. Izuku then designs his suit more appropriately.
  </p>
  <p key="9853e1ec-6f21-4800-a59f-751267dca5d7">
   Shortly after, the reason for the mission is explained to them. Days before, a city suffered from a terrifying terrorist act.

The World Heroes Association is reported that the result has been the same in the other operations, with a large number of sectarians being arrested, but no trace of the leaders or the Trigger Bomb. Due to this, the director of the association orders all hero teams to remain on standbyin their assigned countries for further instruction.

   Endeavor's team stay to reside in a hotel in the capital of Otheon, and use it as a temporary base. Since Izuku, Katsuki, and Shoto are the newest and lowest ranking members of the team, they are sent on various errands for the veteran heroes, much to Katsuki's annoyance.

   As they are returning from shopping, discussing about Humarise and their fanatical paranoia about the Quirk Singularity Theory, Izuku and his classmates witness two villains robbing a jewelry store, taking with them a briefcase full of stolen jewelry. The three chase after them with the villains splitting up in response. Katsuki goes for
   one of the villains
   while Izuku and Shoto go for
   the one with the briefcase

   his Quirk

   When he manages to catch up to the villain, he finds that Shoto has already defeated him, only to be informed that the robber doesn't have the briefcase with him. Izuku then notices a young man, known as

   Izuku chases Rody through the streets, alleys, and rooftops of the city, however the thief is more agile than he appears and knows the city much better than he does, causing Izuku distractions and obstacles that allow him to slip past him. At one point even his bird companion,

   While searching for him, a car accident occurs not far from where he is, and as he approaches the scene of the accident, he notices Rody escape into the subway and board a train just as he was leaving. However, Izuku has no intention of allowing him to escape and runs after him, managing to catch up to the moving train, much to Rody's surprise.
  </p>
  <p key="1c4a4cc6-ed29-46cd-b5c3-5a3777551c88">
   At the next subway stop, Izuku questions Rody about why he was running, to which Rody replies that he was late for work. Izuku asks him to show him what's inside the briefcase, but Rody is evasive and even tells him that he is not obliged to comply since he is a foreign hero, and therefore has no jurisdiction in Otheon. Even so, Izuku insists and they fight over the briefcase until it accidentally opens, showing that inside there are only notepads and documents. Izuku, and especially Rody, are dumbfounded to see that there is no jewelry.
  </p>
  <p key="b1897a10-b98c-42c9-9ad7-35566b9908c8">
   Izuku exaggeratedly apologizes to Rody for taking him for a thief, while Rody awkwardly tries to leave, nervous because he realizes he must've accidentally grabbed the wrong briefcase during the car crash incident. Izuku notices Rody acting weird and follows him to find out what is wrong. Just as they exit the subway, they are surrounded by a large number of policemen, who point their guns at Rody. Izuku tries to defuse the situation, but the confused and scared Rody runs away with the briefcase. This causes the police to start shooting at him, so Izuku decides to run away swinging through the city with Blackwhip, taking Rody with him.

   After a chase through the back streets, Izuku manages to evade the police by climbing onto the edge of a moving train, with Rody still in shock from the experience. The two believe they are safe, but as they cross a bridge, they are attacked by a Humarise agent,

  <p key="209f3c7b-f252-4bee-b274-d12905660284">
   After managing to escape, Izuku gets in contact with Shoto, explaining the situation with them being attacked by the police and a villain. However, Shoto informs him that the Otheon authorities have just publicly announced Izuku himself as being accused of a mass murder of twelve people, notifying the entire nation and resulting in him being put on on the most wanted list. The news also state that he has an accomplice.
  </p>
  <p key="f00673a0-df25-45f3-8aeb-72408c1d3122">
   Izuku is speechless at the accusations, unable to understand what is happening. Shoto advises him to, while the rest of the team tries to investigate the accusations, go into hiding and remove the battery from his phone so the police can't track him down using the GPS. After doing so, Rody asks when his friends will come to help, but Izuku explains what is happening.
  </p>
  <p key="192039c5-f31d-4f9e-b6b6-68e8ac9cabc6">
   Rody is mad at being declared an accomplice to the crimes Izuku is accused of, blaming him for being responsible for his situation and demands explanations. Izuku thinks that since the police shot them without explanation and they were attacked by a villain, their pursuers don't care if they end up dead or alive, so he believes that they are after the briefcase he is carrying. The two check its contents, but find nothing special.
  </p>
  <p key="dbbe07b3-99a1-4850-8716-6dd7133c65e8">
   Rody suggests to hand the briefcase or get rid of it to settle everything, but Izuku advises against it because, on the one hand, it could be related to some sort of crime, and on the other hand, those who want the case probably would kill them anyway. Rody is depressed by his answers, saying that he is overthinking, and asks what they should do. Izuku replies that for now they should make their way over to Klayd, where the Otheon police won't have jurisdiction.
  </p>
  <p key="f7542045-7f3b-4a20-98cf-122f3c08cd3f">
   They change out their clothes and disguise themselves to avoid being spotted by anyone and the police. The two begin their journey by climbing onto the roof of a bus. Rody takes the opportunity to make fun of Izuku, saying that he is committing a petty crime by getting a free ride. With discretion and skill, he pays in advance for two but Rody reminds him that riding on the roof isn't okay.
  </p>
  <p key="d08a7bdb-4411-42f7-8d0d-e669df303122">
   During the trip, Izuku manages to send a text coded message to Shoto, informing him that they are heading towards Klayd. Shoto more or less manages to deduce what is happening after investigating the matter, so he and Katsuki head to the border to meet him.

  <p key="2a6a2e3d-51cf-4165-b836-a59048a11cb4">
   Throughout the journey, Izuku and Rody take a break inside of an old farmhouse to get some rest for the night. While looking at a map of the country, Izuku comes to the conclusion that they will have to walk to Klayd. Rody thinks this is nonsense, but Izuku assures him that if necessary he will carry him on his back, although Rody doesn't take him too seriously, before going to sleep.

   Izuku is awakened by Pino, and realizing what's going on, quickly reaches him when he is being attacked by Humarise's agents, Beros and
   Rogone
   . Izuku manages to defeat Rogone but is shot in the chest by one of Beros' arrows after saving Rody's life. Izuku does manage to generate enough distraction so that he and Rody are able to escape again with the briefcase. Once they are safe, Rody helps Izuku to treat his wound, which fortunately is not very serious since his mobile phone acted as a shield against the arrow, though now being destroyed.
  </p>
  <p key="31686dae-e2fb-4870-8e50-1c06db90dc05">
   The two hide in a cave, and Rody asks Izuku why he protected him despite having betrayed him, without forgetting that he is a criminal who participated in the theft of jewels that led them to that situation. Izuku honestly replies that whenever someone is in danger, he will try to help them no matter what kind of person they are or that he might get hurt. After all, he admires All Might and wants to become a hero as great as him. His words make Rody open up to him and formally introducing himself as Rody Soul and his companion bird as Pino, while Izuku does the same, and that his hero name is Deku.

   The next morning, While Izuku was sleeping, Rody "borrows" an old van to go more easily to Klayd. During the trip, the two get closer to each other, with Rody telling him a little more about his siblings and how his father abandoned them to join Humarise. He also at some point, at Izuku's insistence, tells him his Quirk is actually Pino, who is the manifestation of his soul that shows the emotions that he is actually feeling. He considers the Quirk embarrassing, but Izuku tells him it's great, to his surprise.

   After days of traveling, Izuku and Rody finally reach to the Otheon-Klayd border in the canyon, only to find out that the only way to get across is heavily guarded by the police, forcing them to climb up on the canyon to escape.

   Izuku confronts them but their scuffle results in Rody about to fall off a cliff. Fortunately, Shoto and Katsuki were at the border, who, seeing the battle, rushed to help them. Shoto saves Rody and defeats Sidero, while Katsuki battles Beros until she runs out of arrows. She decides to sacrifice herself rather than be captured, and jumps out of the helicopter into the chasm before it crashes due to the damage received during fight.

   In the aftermath, Katsuki and Shoto meet up with Izuku, and he introduces them to Rody. His classmates explain to them that their attackers are members of Humarise, something they were unaware of until now, and that they want to recover the briefcase for some reason.

With no backup and running out of time, the four of them decide to take the disarming device to disable the bombs.

The leader of Humarise tells him that he cannot allow him to stop his work that allows the purification of the world from the disease of Quirks, and seals the room. Izuku reproaches him for being a fanatical believer of the unproven Quirk Singularity Doomsday Theory, and that his actions only create innocent victims, but Flect Turn dismisses his accusations, assuring that what he does will save humanity.

   Suddenly, Rody arrives and holds him to prevent him from falling to the ground, leaving Izuku surprised to see him there. Rody takes the deactivation card from him and apparently intends to give it to Flect in exchange for him not setting off the Trigger Bomb in Otheon, thus saving his siblings' lives. Izuku tries to convince Rody that they can still win, but Rody claims that it's hopeless.

   All seems lost until Izuku notices Pino hiding in Rody's clothes. Remembering their conversation from earlier, Izuku realizes that Rody is faking it. At a signal from Pino, Izuku attacks an unsuspecting Flect Turn as Rody runs to the control room with the deactivation key. Izuku tries to protect Rody from the laser shots, but one of them manages to seriously injure him. Despite his terrible injury, Rody continues to make his way to the control room, while Izuku keeps Flect Turn at bay, assuring the villain that he won't let stop Rody.

   However, due to his injury, Rody passes out before he can insert the key, with only a few minutes left for the Trigger Bombs to detonate. Seeing Rody's failure, Flect mocks him which makes Izuku furious, attacking him more fiercely than before. On this occasion, although Izuku continues to be violently repelled by Flect's Quirk, with each attack the villain is starting to budge more and more.

   Both Izuku and Flect Turn realize that Reflect has a limit. The villain is especially shocked at this because he never thought it had one.

   Both contenders take their Quirks to their maximum power in order to defeat their opponent, hitting each other hard until Izuku pushes beyond his limitations, unleashing the power of Full Cowl at 100%, constantly attacking to overload Reflect until the Quirk can take no more and collapses, giving Izuku the opportunity to defeat Flect Turn for good with his Super Move:

Rody pretends to be glad that Izuku is going back to Japan so he won't bother him again, but from Pino's reaction, Izuku knows that Rody truly will miss him. Izuku hugs him and bids a farewell, promising that one day he will come back to visit him.

   Winter break ends and students return from their Hero Work-Studies to show their progress with their Quirks and skills. In the boy's changing room, Eijiro praises Izuku for controlling his other Quirk, to which Izuku tells him he can only handle it for a moment and that it doesn't have many uses, but he considers it strong. Annoyed, Katsuki stucks his mask into Izuku's head, surprising and pissing off his classmates, who complain about his attitude.

   As the students go outside, Izuku continues explaining that he needs to let his body adapt to it because it throws off his sense of speed so his brain can't keep up. When the students arrives at Ground Alpha, they meet with All Might, who is replacing Shota because he had an emergency to attend to.
   One by one, the students battle Villain Bots to show off the new skills and Super Moves they have developed.

   Finally, Izuku, Katsuki and Shoto show off what they learned working for the No. 1 Pro Hero, Endeavor at his agency. Izuku shows off the results of his experience and his improved control over Blackwhip. After their exhibition, several of the classmates congratulate the three students for their improvements. Izuku then spots Ochaco, and approaches her, thanking her properly for helping him get Blackwhip under control during their Joint Training Battle. Ochaco brushes him off, and reveals that his new abilities inspired her to add wires to her costume. She thanks him for helping her get stronger, and says that they've both helped each other up, fist bumping Izuku.

  <p key="42562cd3-ca9c-4956-964e-50649e822be6">
   Izuku tells All Might he can only manifest Blackwhip for a second, so he can't compete with Hanta or Shota, but considers it a powerful support-type Quirk. All Might asks him if he made contact with the other users, to which he says no. By checking the information in the notebook, they realize that the previous users did not possess particularly powerful Quirks, because All For One hunted those who possessed powerful Quirks. They also check that they died very young fighting All For One.

   After the two return to the dorms at night, they prepare to help the other students with a hot pot party to energize everyone for the new term. As they continue to socialize, Izuku internally reflects how his life has improved since he entered the U.A., feeling blessed.

  <p key="1ee9a8b2-d9e6-4e56-a40a-d0fe20feed1d">
   Over the next few days, Izuku trains his Quirks. At some point, All Might asks Hanta, Ochaco, and Tsuyu for help with Izuku's training. Izuku explains he wanted help with his new power, though the others point out his hairdo and he explained he played a game with Katsuki revolving around him trying to catch him with Blackwhip and losing everytime, which is why he asks Hanta for help because his Quirk, Tape, is similar. Understanding this, Ochaco and Tsuyu join in.

   All Might says to Ochaco that she is here to help him with body control while braking midair, justifying that he needs more power to cover up his practice of using Float. Actually, since Float is similar to Zero Gravity to some degree, this training will help give Izuku some future control, maybe even help him unlock Nana's Quirk.

   Soon, the voice of the first user of One For All, whom he hadn't heard from since before the Joint Training Battle, begins to warn him of Tomura's awakening, and urges him to stop him.

   When Tomura is about to grab him, Gran Torino suddenly rushes in and grabs the boys before flying in the opposite direction.

   As Gran Torino moves Izuku and Katsuki away from Tomura, heroes like Ryukyu, Eraser Head, Endeavor and other heroes arrive and start fighting him. Gran Torino drops Deku and Katsuki in a safe place as he explains to Deku that Eraser Head is blocking Tomura's Quirk with his own. Katsuki protests that they have been taken so far away, but Gran Torino replies that the situation is worse than imaginable. Tomura is not only much stronger and faster than before, but also has the All For One Quirk, and if Deku lost One For All, it will be the worst-case scenario.

   While arguing, the three watch in shock as the situation worsens even more as a large number of Nomu appear, assisting Tomura. Gran Torino moves to Eraser Head's location to help him against Tomura as he tells Izuku and Katsuki to hide. However, they both disobey the order, and charge at Tomura. Izuku manages to arrive in time to tackle the villain before he can kill Shota,

   Izuku and Katsuki begin to attack Tomura, but even with their efforts and with Shota canceling his Quirks, they barely manage to contain him, having to receive help from Endeavor. Izuku is shocked to know that Tomura's physical strength is on par with All Might's. Endeavor tells Deku and Katsuki that they can act without his direction in this situation, but he wants them to support Eraser Head and protect each other. Tomura moves forward hoping to grab Deku and One For All, but as he demands the student to hand over the Quirk, he ends up calling him his "little brother"; a statement that leaves both of them confused.

Tomura, in turn, says that he won't forgive anyone either as he elbows Deku in the gut. Deku endures it, turning the rage he had towards Tomura into strength for Blackwhip, which manages to keep Tomura restrained, allowing Katsuki and Endeavor to charge forward.

He immediately uses his new Super Move: 100%

He grabs Eraser Head's face at the same time that Deku manages to catch his legs with Blackwhip. Deku yanks him back with Blackwhip at the same time Tomura is struck by a pillar of ice from Shoto, who had decided to follow Izuku and Katsuki.

All For One tries combining his power with Tomura to fight back and steal his brother's Quirk, while insults and derides Izuku, claiming that his brother made a mistake for entrusting One For All in the hands of an inexperienced boy. Yoichi rebuts All For One's arguments by praising Izuku's resolve to save people no matter what, and deems him worthy of wielding the Quirk, and they will follow him because of it.

   After hearing these words, Izuku's manifestation tries to move towards Tomura one more time. In a grand explosion, Deku wakes up from the dream as he and Tomura fall away from one another in the sky. Deku realizes Tomura failed to steal One For All, as All For One tells Tomura that the reason why was because his body hasn't fully adapted to his new Quirk. He tells him that his body needs to reach perfection and to retreat, while Deku pleads with Tomura to stop moving.

Likewise, several of the Near High-End Nomu receive an order and rush to where they are to attack Best Jeanist. When he sees them approaching, Izuku tries to tell himself to move because he knows if anything breaks Best Jeanist's focus, Gigantomachia will break free, believing if he uses Blackwhip and Float his busted limbs won't matter. He yells at himself to not be the worthless Deku who can't save anyone and to support Best Jeanist.

   Dabi unleashes a blast of flames to destroy the Blackwhip, yelling that this is a family affair and he shouldn't mess in it. Izuku replies that it is his business because Shoto is his dear friend and Endeavor is his mentor who made him stronger. He agrees that the past can never die, but he has seen how much Endeavor wants to become a better person, and how he wants to watch that. He yells to Dabi that he isn't Endeavor, which seems to help break Endeavor out of his trance.

Everybody tries to stop them but they fail. Deku uses Blackwhip Froppy Style to jump into the air to confront Tomura/All For One. All For One tells him they will meet again once his body is perfected, using Radio Waves to send him flying away, as Deku screams out to Tomura.

   As he watches Tomura/All For One escape, Izuku begins to reflect. He is aware that everything Tomura has done is unforgivable, but as he sees the Nomu carry Tomura/All For One into the distance, he thinks to himself how when he witnessed him being absorbed by All For One in the vestige world, he recognized his face as one who looked like he needed saving.

   In the aftermath of the battle, Izuku, alongside all the other injured heroes, are taken to Central Hospital to be treated. However, after several days, Izuku is the only one to still remain unconscious, being watched over by All Might, while his arms and legs are completely bandaged up.
   In actuality, the consciousness of Izuku is back in the vestige world, encountering the predecessors of One For All, while All Might senses him from the outside. Yoichi reveals to him that over the past couple months, One For All's power has grown so exponentially that the users can now more freely communicate with each other.

   After Izuku manages to find a way to communicate with the users through his partly manifested mouth, he's introduced to
   Hikage Shinomori
   , the fourth user and the original wielder of Danger Sense. He also learns from him the truth behind his cause of death, which All Might had scribbled out in his notebook, which is that he died of "old age". He reveals that he had decided to use his "turn" with One For All to hide out, away from the world and All For One, training the power for the next user, however after 18 years, the Quirk started to break his body, and that possessing multiple Quirks had ate away at his life. Izuku is shocked and confused by the statement, since All Might held the power for much longer than anyone, however he is soon able to realize the reasoning that the other users also managed to figure out, that All Might was Quirkless.
  </p>
  <p key="1a76ddd0-6ecd-4fd7-94b8-b330e39dfdc2">
   The users discovered that when One For All is transferred to a user with an existing Quirk, it would result in the contents of the vessel being warped and spilling over, eventually resulting in a shorter lifespan, and that All Might held onto it for 40 years because the Quirk took the place of his previously empty vessel. The users, and Izuku, take this information to realize that now, especially after the Quirks of the other users have emerged, One For All can't be transferred to an "ordinary person", that it was a miracle both All Might and Izuku, two Quirkless individuals, managed to have the power bestowed to them, and that due to the slowly diminishing percentage of Quirkless people in the world, Izuku may end up being the last successor of One For All.

   After this revelation, Nana approaches Izuku and asks him if he will be able to kill Tomura Shigaraki, to his surprise. She continues that she and the other users could sense Izuku's feelings during their previous encounter with Tomura, and how he saw him as someone who needed saving. Yoichi reveals that the will of One For All could be overwritten through a being with strong negative emotions, and that All For One purposefully raised Tomura this way to consume him with so much hatred to steal the Quirk. Nana proceeds to confirm that Tomura is her grandson, and became this way due to abandoning

   Izuku reflects on the instance when he connected with Tomura's conscience in One For All, and how in the deepest part of his mind, he was able to sense Tomura, as Tenko, crying. He thinks back to all the Villains he had faced during the past year, noting that he never got the opportunity to learn why they became Villains, and wonders if things would've turned out differently if he did. He knows that despite all the bad Tomura has done, he stands his ground believing that One For All is a Quirk meant to save lives, not kill, something he learned from All Might. He states that through All Might and the users of One For All that have cultivated the power, they have saved countless lives and brought hope to so many out there that he believes the power's purpose has changed. He admits that while it's still possible he will have to kill Tomura, and he doesn't know what he will do yet, he still wants to try and save "that little boy". Yoichi thanks Izuku for his answer, comforting the crying vestige of All Might and Nana, who apologizes to Izuku for testing him and thanking him for sticking to his beliefs.
   While Yoichi asks the second and third users to help their successor, Izuku learns more about Hikage and En's Quirks in preparation.

Sometime after he awakens, Izuku writes letters to each of his classmates in 1-A, revealing the truth behind his Quirk being a power passed down to him by All Might, and that All For One and Tomura are now after him because of it. By the start of what would be his second year in April, Izuku leaves U.A. High.

   Prior to leaving the hospital, Izuku, alongside All Might and Inko, learn from the Central Hospital doctor that despite initially being warned that more extreme injuries would've left him immobilized, the situation is different now. He explains how in the past, the injuries were contained within the body, going off like little explosions, but this time most of the injuries came from the surface. He also adds that thanks to him using Blackwhip to wrap and reinforce his limbs to keep them from shattering, as well as the drastic changes to his body since then, going from being able to handle 5% to 45% capacity, the injuries were nowhere near as severe. Despite this, he still warns him to be careful in the future.

All Might tells her that they are making arrangements to protect him at U.A., but Izuku cuts him off saying he won't be returning. Inko becomes increasingly concerned as her son explains that Tomura can locate him at anytime like now, and he states his desire not to see anyone else get hurt anymore, resolving to stop Tomura and All For One before they reach full strength, and that he'll get stronger.

Before checking out, Izuku visits Gran Torino and gives him Nana's regards which he accepts with a smile.

Deku proceeds to use Float to hover above the city, as well as Smokescreen to reduce Muscular's vision, covering the streets below. Remembering the tactics from their fight, he uses Danger Sense to dodge Muscular's incoming attacks, and finally Blackwhip to grab a hold of him and contained on the ground.

   Muscular is annoyed at the "cheap party tricks", while Deku asks him where Tomura and All For One are. Muscular replies he doesn't know as they just told him to go wild after he was freed, and instead proceeds to berate Deku for just talking and using all these gimmicks rather than having a proper fight. Deku continues anyway, asking why he rages like this, if he has any regrets, and if there is any other path he could go towards, referring to him as "Goto Imasuji", but Muscular simply responds he just wants to indulge in blood and violence and it's useless to try and sympathize with him.

   Hearing Muscular's declaration, Deku thinks back to his previous thought about how if he truly understood the villains maybe things would turn out differently, and how even if the fight now is inevitable, he still wanted to learn at least what makes him tick deep down. As Muscular breaks free from Blackwhip and tries to fight back, Deku notes how the tendons in his Muscle Augmentation have started to unravel thanks to his initial battle with Grand and his vibrations, and that was the reason he was purposefully keeping his distance. Muscular screams in annoyance, as Deku comes at him with a smash to the stomach, knocking him out with one punch, declaring that this is his full power.

   While he tries to get her to tell him where All For One is, she proceeds to use her Rifle to punch him off of her, allowing her to escape and continue to shoot at him. He asks her why she's working for All For One since she used to be a Pro Hero, but brushes him off that he just doesn't understand the real truth. During the chaos, Deku realizes that due to using Fa Jin for the first time, his parallel processes are screwed up, forcing him to attempt to readjust himself while still avoiding the shots.

   Lady Nagant proceeds to explain her history with the Hero Public Safety Commission to Deku, how she believed all she was doing was preserving the fake society by secretly killing rogue villains and corrupt heroes, and how she killed the former President after she was threatened for voicing her resignations.

  <p key="7ff55adf-96e2-4b76-b0d0-9c0f6abc93d1">
   Deku is shocked by the revelation, since the news was that she had killed a fellow Hero in an argument, while she continues saying he's just ignorant, that a superpower society is an illusion and bringing back the status quo will have history repeat itself. Deku, however, admits that while he had been ignorant in the past, he has started to realize the world isn't all black-and-white, but mostly shades of gray, and that is exactly why he needs to lend a helping hand.

   As Deku makes his way over to Lady Nagant's location using Blackwhip, she turns her Rifle to a man on the skyscraper above them, Kai Chisaki, who Deku is surprised to suddenly see as well.
   Shooting the bullet directly at him, Lady Nagant plans to use Deku's hesitation to catch him off guard, however to her surprise, he immediately swings himself forward toward Kai, using a combination of Fa Jin and One For All at 45% to create a sensation of "
   Faux 100% One For All

   After telling Kai they'll talk later, Deku uses Blackwhip to realign himself, as using One For All at 45%, Fa Jin, Danger Sense, Blackwhip, Smokescreen, and Float all in rapid succession caused his parallel processes to get screwed up and needed to take a moment to readjust. Using the last bit of Fa Jin stored up in his leg, he utilizes a
   Faux 100 Percent: Manchester Smash

   As she starts to fall, Deku grabs ahold of her, telling her that he recognized that the shot headed toward Kai was off, and that she could've shot him right from the beginning rather than give him a chance to surrender, meaning she's not truly on All For One's side. He tells her that because she's seen the darkness, she can also recognize the light, and asks her to join him since he still sees the soul of a Hero within her. As Lady Nagant smiles and starts to tell Deku he is a true hero, she suddenly self-destructs causing Deku to scream in fear.

   Hawks soon arrives to catch the unconscious Lady Nagant, followed by Endeavor to back him up. Due to still not having enough feathers to fly and carry someone, Deku uses Blackwhip to grab ahold of them but can't carry them due to running out of strength. He manages to tell them that Lady Nagant had received a Quirk from All For One and because of that, he believes that the self-destruction was part of a trap he implemented. Landing on the ground, Hawks gets Lady Nagant to briefly wake up and inform them of the location she was supposed to deliver Deku too, as well as warning them about other criminals All For One hired to go after him.

   Endeavor returns carrying Kai, who berates Lady Nagant for not fulfilling her promise, as he just wants to apologize to his Boss. Hearing his pleas, Deku confronts Kai asking if he remembers what he did to Eri, as he goes off saying he wishes she was here too. Deku tells him he understands he wants to apologize, and that if he can direct those feelings toward Eri as well, he will honor the deal in Lady Nagant's place. All Might arrives as the Heroes prepare to fully apprehend Lady Nagant and Kai, as well as deliver the former to medical aid, which Hawks also suggests Deku do as well, all the while he festers up with rage toward All For One.

They're then faced with a pre-recorded message from All For One, taunting Izuku for expecting him not being able to abandon someone like Lady Nagant and falling into the trap. He continues on about how society labels people who don't fit in as "villains", and that all the fights Izuku will have to deal with continue to wear his soul down. He concludes revealing that he was the only one he kept thinking about in prison, and that he no longer cares about All Might, stating it is "his turn", as the hideout suddenly explodes.

   Shortly after escaping the explosion, the Pro Heroes regroup to plan their next move while Deku continues his endless quest to hunt down the villains. He's soon attacked by another hired assassin, but almost immediately takes him down with ease. He quickly leaves the body behind, warning All Might to be careful in case he is rigged to explode, but before he can leap away, All Might yells at him to stop. He tries to hand him another lunchbox, however Deku tells him he doesn't need to follow him anymore, since he can practically move his body at 100% capacity without injury just like him, so he shouldn't worry about him. Despite All Might's attempts to reach out to Deku and tell him to take it easy, he is left behind as Deku heads off all alone.

   Endeavor attempts to contact the lone Deku, informing him that the foreign heroes should be arriving soon to assist and that he should take this time to rest, but he refuses to stop and continues his search for the villains. At the same time, the previous wielders of One For All also try to get Deku not to push himself, but he also ignores them as he jumps toward danger. He arrives at a mall where he protects a group of civilians from some thugs, but after they retreat, the woman cowers over Deku's appearance, seeing his multiple Quirks and believing he's working for All For One. He quickly shoots that down, as they are nervously relieved running to safety.

   He continues running from location to location, whenever he receives a notice from Danger Sense, endlessly fighting villains and protecting civilians caught in the middle, with barely any sleep or eating time. During his escapades, rumors begin to pop up regarding Deku, with some believing him to be some kind of Nomu, and others seeing him helping people, although also noting he looks nothing like a hero, as his costume becomes more tattered and his Blackwhip more out of control, contributing to his monstrous appearance. Meanwhile in his mind, all he can think about is tracking down All For One and the League of Villains, and doing everything in his power to save everyone, all so he can once again reunite with those he cares about, specifically his classmates, so he can smile with them again.

However, unable to use Air Force properly without his gloves, nor Blackwhip being too dangerous, the civilians dog pile Deku as they apologize for attacking him, tearing off his costume. He silently understands, as he attempts to think of a way to help them, but slowly starts to fall unconscious.

   When the rest of Class 1-A arrive on the scene, he asks why they came and they answer that they wanted to help him. Izuku responds saying he is fine and for them to stay away, causing Katsuki to mockingly applaud him before asking if he can smile now. Izuku says that he needs to keep moving if everyone can smile again, and demands everyone get out of his way, prompting his classmates to fight him.

Anima uses his Quirk to command birds to halt Deku, yelling that Nezu has asked him to come back and stop running away. He tries to use Blackwhip to free himself, but Cellophane uses his Tape to grab ahold of it, commenting how freaky it looks. Earphone Jack then uses her

Deku continues to insist that he'll put everyone in danger and he doesn't want All For One to take them away from him, which is why he had to leave. Tsukyuomi appears next, using Dark Shadow to grab onto Deku, knocking him into a building. Sugarman, after rescuing Earphone Jack and Tailman, yells at him that while he may have a special power, they all share the same feelings, and to think about what they said, or else he won't let him use food coloring for Eri's candy apples.

Recognizing it's a machine to put him to sleep, Deku breaks free, yelling at them to stop wasting their efforts on him. Chargebolt grabs ahold of him next, telling him that even though One For All is important, and they may not have any hobbies in common, he's still someone he considers a friend so he will force him to listen. Tentacole uses his Dupli-Arms covered in Insulation Tape created by Creati to cover up Deku and Chargebolt, reminding him of Deku's words during the Training Camp how everyone together can even give All Might a scare.

Deku, however, says that that version of him is gone, striking Grape Juice with Blackwhip, slamming into a nearby building.

Thankfully, Red Riot is there able to catch them. He then tells Deku that he remembered an old story on the news about a kid his age that rushed to save a friend from a villain, and figured it was him that day. He says that being a Hero has nothing to do with being special or strong, and his behavior from back then is what everyone else is doing now.

   Dynamight walks over to him though, and asks if he remembers what he said when he got stabbed by Tomura during the war. When Deku says he doesn’t, Dynamight reminds him that he said “stop trying to win this on your own," and continues telling him that in that moment, his body had moved on its own. Dynamight admits he looked down on Deku because he was Quirkless, and therefore he felt he would be far behind, but the truth was, he always felt he was above him.

Thirteen informs Izuku how most of the civilians have been evacuated to various centres, with only the anti-hero vigilantes and violent pillagers left to deal with, though also notes that those numbers have been dwindling due to the anti-hero civilians' exhaustion and the pillagers being easy to catch.

Yuga tells Izuku that after reading his letter and finding out he too was Quirkless, he fell into utter despair. Izuku’s Danger Sense goes off as Yuga prepares to fire at him with a Navel Laser, with Izuku ready to defend, but Toru jumps in front and refracts the laser away. After Toru confronts Yuga about how his actions have effected everyone, with the parents trying to rebut, Izuku uses Blackwhip to restrain all three of them, with him telling Yuga for them to put an end to this now.

   The Aoyamas are taken to the U.A. A.V. Room, where they are interrogated, by All Might, Naomasa and the Police Force, the U.A. Staff, and Class 1-A, all who are devastated by the betrayal. Among everyone’s reactions, Katsuki simply states that it’s a “small world” that he’s another one of them that started out as Quirkless.
  </p>
  <p key="bad9048b-bab4-46fe-aa53-7ad8dbfd8367">
   The parents explain how they know nothing about All For One, only carrying out his orders, fearing for their lives if they disobeyed, while Yuga himself confesses, feeling that he is terrible for having the nerve to try and smile with everyone like they were friends after everything he’s done. Especially after seeing Izuku, another former Quirkless person, fighting so hard against All For One, made him realize how pathetic he was, wallowing in his own despair, and that he’s just a villain through and through.
  </p>
  <p key="e94bd2a9-396c-4344-8852-945eb60ab811">
   However, Izuku bluntly retorts, asking if that was true why he tried to save Katsuki and Fumikage during the Training Camp, as well as asking about his cheese message, now realizing that it was a cry for help, and that’s why he’s crying now. He continues that he knows of another Hero who was manipulated by All For One, but her soul wasn’t crushed, only her spirit. He states that doing wrong doesn’t make you a villain for the rest of your life, as he extends his hand to Yuga, telling him he can still be a hero.
  </p>
  <p key="5803b358-ccb9-43b9-be80-65c86c990c91">
   Naomasa dismisses Izuku's pleas, reminding him that no matter the circumstances, he still conspired with All For One, and even then, they still aren't sure if he's booby-trapped like Lady Nagant was, so they can't allow him to talk again until he's examined at Central Hospital. He continues to interrogate the Aoyama parents, only for Izuku to cut him off, reminding them that they have no way of locating All For One. This causes his classmaes to remember Izuku's point about "steering the villains" to enter the fight, realizing Yuga may be the only one able to deceive All For One.
  </p>
  <p key="7f3a05c4-9e2e-4e37-8876-50a2469fa2a5">
   Present Mic asks Class 1-A why, with them being the greatest victims after all this, they're so willing to trust him, but Tenya simply responds that what happened is in the past, and with them being unable to realize how he's been feeling all this time, they carry some responsibility, so they must reach out to him as friends in order for them to become equals again. Eijiro also yells to Yuga that while he may have thought it was impossible to against All For One, now Izuku has given him and his parents a chance to finally break free from him, reminding him that they would never blame someone for being Quirkless, or would hate them for holding back their tears and hiding their pain in secret.
  </p>
  <p key="a5611e32-e7c0-44f4-aaf4-f06036564e9e">
   Naomasa reminds the class that the Aoyamas already told them All For One won't believe any lies so they need to keep a level head, when Izuku is called on by Shota Aizawa, watching from a tablet held by Present Mic. He asks Izuku if he has a plan, which he says no, followed by him addressing Naomasa, taking full responsibility for also not recognizing and siding with the rest of the class, informing Yuga he has no intenion of expelling him from U.A.
  </p>
  <p key="6d0aa951-e482-4bcd-b4fb-63e03e000a1f">
   Shota reveals that he has an idea, and after the Aoyama Family's ears have been covered, he informs Class 1-A, the U.A. Staff, and the Police Force of his plan. After the discussion, Nezu states that it seems possible, while Naomasa has the Aoyama Family escorted back to their HQ, telling everyone not to say a word to anyone else about the plan. Before he leaves, Izuku shouts out to Yuga, with the rest of the class looking on sullenly.

   Back at Heights Alliance, Class 1-A take a breather, before getting ready to gear back up, as everyone, with fire and rage in their eyes over the betrayal, prepares to bring All For One down once and for all. Izuku and Tenya go to the Development Studio in order to fix up their hero costumes, when Izuku is suddenly caught in a very familiar explosion blast. Mei Hatsume emerges from the smoke, once again landing directly on top of Izuku, as she asks him what he needs, all the while his face keeps a stern expression.
  </p>
  <p key="00ed0025-78bc-495f-9ad9-1ad84d409628">
   Mei asks Izuku and Tenya what they need from her, with Izuku lamenting how his Danger Sense didn’t activate. Tenya tells Mei they came looking for repairs for their Hero Costumes with her confused why they don’t just take them to the item agency. Mei’s increasingly nonchalant reactions cause Izuku to realize that Mei has no idea what is going on outside.
  </p>
  <p key="b52134d4-df9e-483f-9faf-96c548c412fe">
   Power Loader emerges from the explosions, inviting the students to see the new set-up in the Development Studio, revealing they are in charge of both developing and controlling the U.A. Barrier. Izuku hands Mei his Mid-Gauntlet, asking if she can fix it for him, but she immediately says no, as due to how damaged it is she’d have to create a new one, and they don’t have the amount of condenium required for the compression mechanism. She also quickly shuts down Tenya's requests as well, as two of her classmates approach them saying they’ll make it.
  </p>
  <p key="5e6574ad-3b8c-4f00-a94c-3a879ed0a51a">
   Tenya is surprised that Mei would turn down the offer due to how much she loves making things, as Izuku looks on to see her currently working on the evacuation shelter blocks. Power Loader tells them that Mei was brought on to help strengthen the barrier, and she’s been busy creating new mechanisms in case of mass evacuation. Power Loader compliments her inventive mind, and she responds with how she always needs to try think up new “babies” to improve themselves.
  </p>
  <p key="315681b3-71e9-4746-9357-cc43b9262d38">
   Izuku compliments Mei on how focused and busy she is with her inventions that she had no idea how the outside world is, but Mei responds calling him dense, saying that even she is aware of the trouble Heroes are facing now. And while they aren't fighters, they’re also doing everything they can to protect people; inventing stuff being how the support course does heroics.
  </p>
  <p key="6a738de5-604b-445c-9301-692b77f1e36c">
   Before Izuku can react, Mei throws a pair of Air Force Gloves attached to new make-shift Gauntlets right at his face, saying that she couldn’t make an exact copy but it’s the best she can do, surprising Izuku that she did that all with just her left hand. She proceeds to throw a new piece of armor for Tenya right at his face too, exasperating the support students that she did it all so fast. She concludes saying for them to tell the rest of the hero students that they’ll all win this.
  </p>
  <p key="f061372e-e013-4857-bba9-47bbe4fb47dc">
   Outside, Izuku and Tenya meet up with the rest of Class 1-A and Mt. Lady, who reminds them that even after learning what they just dealt with, their main objective is tracking down and eliminating the remnants of the villains, and they must do it all without haste. Mina wonders if Yuga will still take their hand and help them, with Izuku and Shoto replying that they believe he will come back. Following Izuku, the Class 1-A Search Squad assembles and heads out.
  </p>
  <p key="58bd0faa-3886-472c-bd9c-ec1c34485b98">
   Later that night, Class 1-A ended up with nothing and no information about the villains' whereabouts. After returning to Heights Alliance, Izuku laments the lack of any free time given to them due to the number of prisoners still being on the run and the whereabouts of All For One. As his class takes a break, he thinks about how he hasn't been able to thank Ochaco properly yet. All Might, alongside Naomasa and Nezu, then burst into the dorm, to inform them all about their secret finalized plans for the upcoming second War.
  </p>
  <p key="bc43bf46-8a93-4207-bed1-c6b95a538827">
   They explain to the class the full extent of their plans: that they have purposefully been running themselves around to make All For One, who is presumably observing them through Search, believe they are being exhausted, allowing them to catch him off guard and utilize Yuga to choose the location to lure him out. Class 1-A, especially Izuku, react in joyousness over Yuga’s involvement, but when asked about how to get around All For One being able to perceive their lies, they bring in Shota’s next part of the plan, Hitoshi Shinso.
  </p>
  <p key="0313a1ee-d172-4912-96a0-940e76e5a4d1">
   To the class’ further surprise, he reveals that he has trained his Quirk to allow himself to be able to make people speak when Brainwashed, and that they can use this in order to get the Aoyamas to communicate with All For One without effecting their emotions. When asked about what happens after they lure the Villains out and if its possible to deploy all the Heroes without being found out, All Might states the Heroes don’t have to be there in advance, revealing Shota’s next piece to use Neito to Copy Kurogiri’s Warp Gate.
  </p>
  <p key="fbd7a4da-c7fa-4e3f-8fd4-cf9476b0b5c2">
   The next day, Nezu announces to the civilians within U.A. that Tomura will make his big move in 4 days, with Class 1-A giving their thanks to everyone at the entrance, and Izuku saying he’s had more than enough time to clean himself up, with them all ready to head back out. Class 1-A each say goodbye to their family members and their friends. Izuku reunites with his mother Inko, Kota, and Eri one last and final time before heading out.
  </p>
  <p key="41f11afc-c764-4ff2-a7a1-c38f48dd4110">
   Class 1-A reconvenes at the Makeshift Fortress dubbed, “Troy”, a fortified structure where they can stay at. After moving in, Izuku spots Ochaco reflecting outside and jumps down see her. He thanks Ochaco for what she did earlier, which she simply brushes off, before saying she’s just watching the city. She proceeds to tell him she feels weird, as back when she was shouting from the top of the building, Himiko popped into her head. Izuku replies that he understands her, having seen a little boy crying inside Tomura, and that even though there’s no way to avoid the battle, he can’t ignore that side of him.

   Izuku stays with Class 1-A at Troy until he is contacted by Yuga and agrees to meet him at a disclosed location in a parking lot nearby. He asks if he’s supposed to be detained, and Yuga says his parent’s lawyer had him released. Yuga proceeds to tell Izuku about All For One’s true goals: to become the Demon Lord of the world after chaos spreads throughout the world unchecked. With Japan fallen, the economy is shattered, alongside the various villain attacks all over the world, facing such immense crisis since the Great Depression, or even the period of the advent of Quirks, chaos has already begun to spread unchecked.
  </p>
  <p key="c98366ea-6477-4e24-94bf-d4ba1fac428e">
   Izuku declares he will never let that happen, with Yuga apologizing, as All For One finally re-emerges from behind him. All For One congratulates Yuga and prepares to attack Izuku, when Yuga overcomes his greatest fear and betrays against All For One, hitting him with his Navel Laser. Izuku deploys Smokescreen to cover Yuga, telling him how good his performance was that they managed to trick him. Annoyed, and since using Search he can tell all the Heroes Tomura faced are miles away, All For One uses his Warping Quirk to summon an army of villains to overwhelm One For All once and for all.
  </p>
  <p key="df918b4b-c81a-427f-87a2-7b47c3e3dac9">
   However, All For One is once again taken aback when he spots Kurogiri’s Warp Gate starting to appear behind them, spotting Neito Monoma appearing from one of them. As the rest of the Heroes begin emerging from the gates, Yuga declares to All For One Japan isn't finished with them, and that today is the day where he falls.
  </p>
  <p key="4884939e-4f28-4008-bc56-8a5c74f2b14c">
   With all of the villains in one place, All Might activates the Troy system as cages emerge from beneath the battlefield, trapping all the villains in individual metal containers. Neito summons several more Warp Gates around the cages, as the Heroes prepare to shove them all in, to split up the villains. Izuku blasts all of the villains with Air Force to push them all through new Warp Gates. However, before he can follow Katsuki into his Warp Gate to face Tomura, he is suddenly caught off guard by a whip, forcefully dragging him into a separate Gate, to his confusion.

   Izuku ended up getting warped to an aquarium in
   Okuto Island
   , alongside Ochaco and Tsuyu, by Himiko using her whip. He is confused that his Danger Sense didn’t even activate, staring down Himiko. He contacts the U.A Flying Sky Fortress where he was supposed to be in and asks a Warp Gate at his location, but Shota reveals that he and the other heroes cannot help him due to the new abilities of Tomura despite Neito using Erasure on him to keep the villain from using his Quirks. He tells Izuku that he is on his own to find a way back to the mainland. Before he can leave, Himiko ambushes him, declaring her love for him and asks Izuku to not leave. He is still surprised that even when she's charging at him, his Danger Sense isn’t activating, wondering how someone like her could get so far in life. Izuku asks what she wants as Himiko tells him to be her boyfriend, leading to confused reactions from him and Ochaco.
  </p>
  <p key="4342f4f7-bc7a-48a6-b52b-5b1dfaf863e4">
   Izuku freaks out with flabbergasting reactions, asking what she’s talking about, leading Himiko to confess she’s felt this way ever since they first met, since he was so beaten up and looked exactly like her

   Himiko asks him what he wants to do with her, and Izuku responds by saying that he too wanted to become like All Might, and that he understands her, and how fulfilling it feels. However, he proceeds to say he could never share the same heart and mind as him or think about hurting the ones he love. Enraged, Himiko attacks him and Ochaco with her knives and whips, with Tsuyu and Ochaco holding their own against Himiko. Ochaco tells Izuku to leave now to deal with Tomura, and to trust in them to handle Himiko. Izuku nods in agreement and speeds away.

   Using Float, Fa Jin, and his Air Force, Izuku blasts his way across the ocean, however laments that he is still too slow, noting that there’s nothing for Blackwhip to sling off of, so he is unable to use his Faux 100 Percent technique. He thinks about needing to get faster, when the Second User of One For All appears telling him not to lose his cool.
  </p>
  <p key="cfa0f67b-79ac-4ea9-b19f-687c672be7ac">
   He reminds him his gear can't withstand using One For All at 100%, asking if he plans on hurting himself before he even reaches the battlefield. He then asks if he tried to activate his Meta Ability, which Izuku responds yes to. He tells him that it is only to be used as a last resort, as after melding with One For All, it has evolved into a "unique power" and something which can't be wielded like it used to. He tells him to believe in his friends, who are all out there for their own reasons, and to focus on his own battle.
