   Tenya has a very good relationship with his older brother, Tensei. Tenya looks up to Tensei and sees him as a role model, aspiring to be like him. When he finds out that Tensei is critically injured, he leaves the Sports Festival, despite knowing he could receive a medal, and rushes to see his brother in the hospital.
   The bond between them is so strong that Tenya decides to avenge his brother by seeking out

   Later, during the joint training, Tensei shows a more positive and supportive attitude, which Tenya attributes to his brother's progressing recovery. After this, Tenya shows more determination to represent his brother, inheriting his hero name, Ingenium.
   In a flashback, sometime after Tenya passed the Provisional Hero License Exam, Tensei is shown to be proud of his brother's progress and considers that he is ready for "tuning" his engines.

   Along with Ochaco, Tenya is one of the first people to befriend Izuku on their first day of school, a friendship that Tenya mentions surprised him. Although he greatly respects and admires Izuku, he also views him as a rival; Tenya feels that he needs to challenge him in order to grow as a hero.
   However, the rivalry between them is much friendlier than Izuku's other rivalries. Tenya respects Izuku for his dedication towards a goal or task once he has put his mind to it and not giving up on said goal or task. Likewise, Izuku respects Tenya's leadership, determination, and perseverance.
