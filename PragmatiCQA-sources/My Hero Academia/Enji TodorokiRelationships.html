   Enji is Rei's Husband. Endeavor bought her family over to marry her through a
   Quirk marriage
   . It's revealed that he chose her because of how her ice Quirk counters the drawbacks of his

    Quirk
   </a>
   .
   Despite his reasons for marrying her, he did show some feelings for her when they first met, as he described her as a strong person who could melt at the slightest touch. The fact that he also remembered her favorite flowers even though she only mentioned it once shows that he at least cared about her in the beginning.
  </p>
  <p key="ccd51dea-83dd-4755-b94e-8375654575c1">
   As shown in his memories, Enji initially had a much healthier relationship with his wife during the first few years of their marriage. He was genuinely happy when raising and training Toya's Quirk when it was evident that it possessed superior firepower to his own and was happy upon the birth of their second daughter Fuyumi despite her not having the Quirk he hoped for. Later, Enji said that he never forced Rei to have more children against her will and that she herself genuinely wanted more, due to believing that they could encourage each other.
  </p>
  <p key="13ee1733-131c-44fa-8fa2-45c342394a4d">
   However, the relationship between them started to sour when Toya's stubbornness prevented him from stopping from training and subsequently burning himself, leading to Enji's decision to have more kids so Touya would be forced to give up.
   After Natsuo and Shoto were born, Enji's obsession to overcome All Might led him to train Shoto only while neglecting the others. Despite Rei telling him that all Toya wanted was to be acknowledged, he responded that all he can show is the world of heroes. Rei accused him of running away, something he would admit to be true to Natsuo years later.
   When he started training Shoto when he was still very young, Rei tried to stop him, but Enji refused to listen and told her to stay out of his way, smacking her when she protected Shoto. When he caught Toya with burns on his stomach, Endeavor hit Rei and accused her that Touya was still using his quirk.
  </p>
  <p key="3835f843-dd5f-4b39-ab35-5b1aeb2c1679">
   Enji's and Rei's relationship deteriorated to the point of constant abuse of her and their children, and Enji's behavior became so bad that Rei couldn't stand the sight of him. Rei eventually had a mental breakdown and she ended up hurting Shoto.
   After this incident, Enji put her in an mental institution.
  </p>
  <p key="0730442b-1f50-433c-b654-553b6e22c783">
   In the present, Enji has actually visited his wife at the hospital often, and though he hasn't seen her face to face, he would leave the flower that she told him she liked when they first met as a gift.
   After Enji was forced to become Number 1 Hero after All Might retired, he eventually realized the damage he has done to his family, after which he tries to fix the situation with his family, accepting the possibility that they can never forgive him.
  </p>
  <p key="1676ffe5-6d80-4d6c-b6a8-e07bfadb6f68">
   Finally, he concludes that in order for Rei and their children to be happy, he plans to have Fuyumi, Natsuo, and Shoto move in with their mom in a new house built in a more convenient location. He has more or less cut himself out of their lives.

When he expresses his feelings, Rei interjects and asks him what he's referring to, stating that the rest of his family has carried the same pain for much longer than him.

   Originally, his oldest son Toya was supposed to be his successor because his fire Quirk gave him flames more powerful than even Endeavor's. As such, Endeavor tried to train him and teach him one of his secret techniques. He seemed to not push Toya through the same ruthless training he would later do with Shoto, and in return Toya was excited to learn his father's ultimate move and surpass All Might, demonstrating a more positive relationship.
   Unfortunately, Toya inherited his mother's weaker constitution which prevented him from improving it. Seeing this, Endeavor stopped training Toya but due to him inheriting his stubbornness, Toya continuously trained himself regardless of the burn scars he got. This behavior ultimately led to the birth of Natsuo and Shoto in an attempt to force him to give up, but all it did was make Toya even more determined to prove himself and be acknowledged. At one point, Endeavor told Toya to live a life beyond that of a Hero, but Toya told him that it is because he lit the fire in him to surpass All Might that he can't quit.

   One day, after Toya broke down and almost attacked Shoto as an infant, Endeavor chose to seclude his youngest son from his other siblings while asking Rei to keep her eye on Toya. Endeavor claimed he felt he could only show Toya the world of a hero but Rei felt he was running away, a statement he would confess to Natsuo years later.
   Endeavor's neglectful treatment of his eldest son was what ultimately drove him to train at Sekoto Peak, resulting in him incinerating his body and disappearing; he would reveal that the reason he chose not to go to Sekoto Peak with Toya was that he had no idea what to say to him. At first, Enji appeared to show no guilt about this accident, but in actuality, he bore much anger at himself for what happened. His flashback showed Enji looking at the burning Sekoto Peak while shouting in absolute horror.
   Recently, it has been shown that he acknowledges that it's his fault for Toya's fate and that the supposed death of his eldest son was something Enji can never forgive himself for.

Dabi also admits wanting to make Endeavor suffer for the rest of his life, believing he doesn't deserve any redemption for his past sins. For these reasons, Dabi ultimately desires to kill and put an end to his father.
   Upon learning the truth about his oldest son being alive, he initially refuses to believe it, claiming that Dabi is telling a despicable lie, but Endeavor is forced to accept the reality of what Toya had become. The shock of this revelation is so great that he is unable to move or do anything as Dabi prepares to attack Endeavor and the others, only able to think of how he'd initially believed his oldest son to still be alive and searched for him.
   Dabi also wanted to make sure Endeavor suffered more by nearly burning Shoto and himself alive, so the hero would be distraught at losing his "masterpiece" at the hands of his "failed creation" but after he fell unconscious did he stop.

   Eventually, as with her brothers Toya and Natsuo, Endeavor ultimately neglected her. Despite this, Fuyumi is the only child better able to look past their father's faults and forgive him for his previous behavior, especially since her father was trying to atone for his mistakes and be a better person.

As explained during the Sports Festival, Enji regarded Shoto merely as a tool to surpass All Might, because Shoto possesses a perfect mix of both his parents' Quirks, something his other children do not. As a result, Enji put Shoto through ruthless training, which caused Shoto a severe degree of physical and emotional pain. Shoto, harboring a bitter hatred towards his father on account of this, as well as the abuse towards his mother, refused to use his fire powers in battle until Izuku Midoriya reminded him of his mother's encouragement.

   When Hawks visits Endeavor in the hospital after the Paranormal Liberation War, he is surprised at his unexpected visit. Hawks explains the situation going on in society and the utter chaos that is ensuing, but when Hawks offers help to Endeavor, he is shocked and confused at why Hawks would choose to aid him. Regardless, Endeavor is extremely thankful for Hawks' support, and when he asks the number one hero if he can stand up and move forward, tears return to his eyes as he replies that he can, happy to know that he won't have to fight alone.

Katsuki's attitude displeases Endeavor and he asks Shoto if he really is his friend.
