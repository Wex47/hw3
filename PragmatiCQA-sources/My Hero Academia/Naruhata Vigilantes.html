   Quirk is not too powerful. All in all, thanks to Knuckleduster's training and the experience he gains fighting villains, he improves notably in these aspects over time, discovering new abilities of his Quirk that make him more effective in combat.

   The team is formed when the Vigilante Knuckleduster saw potential in Koichi Haimawari when he tried to save Kazuho Haneyama from

   Koichi doesn’t want to be part of Knuckleduster's plan, especially after knowing his violent methods of investigating, but after confronting a Trigger dealer, he finally agrees to become in his apprentice and being trained into "The Crawler". Kazuho decides to also join the team to help them in the investigation, primarily to stay close to Koichi who she secretly has a crush on. Sometime afterwards, Knuckleduster takes
   Koichi's Penthouse
   as a base, with Kazuho visiting them there often as well.

Around this time, Kazuho begins to participate less and less in vigilantism activities to focus more on her idol career with FeatherHATS, so many times Koichi must work alone as a Vigilante.
