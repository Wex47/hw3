   As they're patrolling the city, Endeavor notices a disturbance that no one else picks up on and jumps the nearby rail. He tells the boys to stand back and watch him but the trio arm themselves with their support equipment, eager to help. A villain named
   Starservant
   is causing havoc in the city and

   Endeavor uses Flashfire to speed away toward the area of disturbance, leaving the boys struggling to keep up. Starservant begins collecting all the glass in the area into a giant sphere, but Endeavor completely destroys it in seconds. The villain flees from the hero's heat and leads Endeavor down an alley to be ambushed by his allies.
  </p>
  <p key="24809d84-1e0e-46bc-88d2-30682a802f22">
   Izuku and Katsuki spring into action, ready to stop the secondary villains. However, Hawks suddenly appears and takes them all down with blinding speed. Endeavor restrains the villain and seems irritated with Hawks for not telling him he was in town. Izuku introduces himself to Hawks, and the Winged Hero reveals he's too busy to work with

  </p>
  <p key="9f2270d6-a270-433f-a3ab-93e595e69dd1">
   Afterward, Endeavor and the boys go to the Endeavor Agency building, where the boys are introduced to
   <a href="Moe Kamiji.html" key="04e7cdec-8556-4b08-be40-cd48f00c877e" title="Moe Kamiji">

   </a>
   . Burnin claims the boys won't have any time to shine because the Endeavor Agency has over 30 sidekicks, but Katsuki just takes this as a challenge.
   Kido
   explains the agency takes over 100 requests a day, meaning the heroes respond to several emergencies, escorts, and special events.
  </p>
  <p key="eb883845-c44c-4fcc-8077-385eff0b505b">
   Endeavor emerges from his office after deciphering a coded message from Hawks. To ensure Hero Society survives the coming battles, Endeavor listens to Hawks warning and decides to train the next generation as insurance. Burnin believes that Katsuki and Izuku will be stuck with the sidekicks while Shoto goes with Endeavor, but instead, Endeavor decides to take all three of them out with him.
  </p>
  <p key="3f06b19b-e82a-416a-91cf-48815f0a0a1b">
   The Flame Hero reveals he'll be supervising the trio himself and asks Katsuki and Izuku about their abilities. More specifically, Endeavor asks what the boys are working on and what they wish to achieve. Izuku reveals that he wants to be able to use
   <a href="Blackwhip.html" key="db21bad3-8158-464f-89bc-b8be8ac5bd41" title="Blackwhip">
    Blackwhip
   </a>
   as if it's second nature, applying the same concept he uses for Air Force in order to turn it into a weapon rather than a liability. Katsuki wishes to learn what he's missing in order to become the strongest. Endeavor prepares to move out, but Shoto interrupts and reveals he wants to be treated the same as his friends.
  </p>
  <p key="c20dfdb5-61be-4dd9-970b-96e95fe08f3e">
   Endeavor accepts Shoto's words and they all move out to patrol the city. The Endeavor Agency responds to requests for battle, evacuation, and rescue, all three of the main tasks for a hero. The boys must learn their turf, act quickly to pick up on any disturbances, and keep damage to a minimum. Endeavor tasks the boys with conquering the experience barrier by defeating a villain faster than him before the winter is over.
  </p>
  <p key="b0a1ea18-dec1-4ddb-be5b-7d72b4880d2e">
   While chasing someone who committed a hit and run, Izuku thinks about how to quickly master his abilities. Endeavor stops the villain on the bike and Kido restrains them. The Flame Hero points out how the boys were one step too slow and Katsuki blames it on the winter. Shoto points out to Katsuki that Endeavor condenses his flames and shoots them out of his feet to move at top speed.
  </p>
  <p key="562d3ab2-d77f-4cdd-96de-0694d87d00b4">
   Kido keeps the villain restrained and tells the boys to keep following Endeavor. As they move to the next area, Endeavor admits Katsuki is fast but simply not fast enough. The winter excuse isn't going to cut it if a hero is too late to save others. At the same time, Endeavor stops a moving truck from striking a civilian, hammering home his point.
  </p>
  <p key="0c9d4c09-eae1-4f61-a5b5-f252ce78ed40">
   The No. 1 Hero tasks Shoto and Katsuki with learning to focus their power by condensing it and releasing it at full power for only a moment. He tells Izuku he must learn to use air force subconsciously and then add learning how to do so with Blackwhip once he's done that. Endeavor encourages the boys to take advantage of training by his side and adds that no matter how many times they fail they'll never impede his work.
  </p>
  <p key="49dc6f11-1047-4ac6-833a-c307fac8036b">
   A week later, the boys get to the agency at the crack of dawn for work. Burnin teases that they won't easily be able to take down a villain quicker than Endeavor. The boys remain positive that they're making progress and Burnin is happy to see the boys don't need her to tease them in order to get fired up.
  </p>
  <p key="a0b96d1a-0e8c-4d23-93a9-08230ac9b379">
   They move out on patrol and while Endeavor stops a thief, he reminds the trainees to keep up the effort until they can focus on using their powers effortlessly. After another day of work, the boys go to the Todoroki abode to have dinner that was prepared by Fuyumi.
   Natsu storms out due to his tattered relationship with his father and a villain notices him outside. The villain Ending is obsessed with choosing how he dies and he wants his death to come at the hands of Endeavor's bright flames.
  </p>
  <p key="6f9c7b16-5c2d-4c15-8f37-23ff1d40e169">
   After dinner, Endeavor prepares to drive the boys home. However, while being chauffeured, everyone notices Ending in the middle of the street holding Natsuo hostage. Ending's Quirk allows him to control road paint and he boosts his abilities with Trigger. Endeavor confronts Ending directly and the villain demands his own death or else Natsuo will die.
  </p>
  <p key="68a205dd-3bdf-4014-8d27-1511c58f02e9">
   The boys burst out of the car and the chauffeur gives them their support gear. Ending is taken off guard by the boys allowing Endeavor to close the distance. However, Endeavor stops cold in his tracks due to the fear he notices on Natsuo's face. Shoto uses Endeavor's training to focus his flames to a point and releases them for a moment at maximum heat in order to counter Ending's white line attacks. The villain attempts to kill civilians by flipping cars in the air but Katsuko condenses his explosive power and in a quick burst, saves Natsuo from the clutches of ending.
  </p>
  <p key="900fae5e-deee-4290-8e96-94ce8f293adc">
   Deku manages to use Air Force subconsciously to propel himself in the air and then adds Blackwhip on top in order to secure the falling cars. Endeavor is amazed to see that in just one week, the boys have completed all their tasks. With a finishing blow, Shoto defeats Ending and Endeavor embraces Natsuo.
  </p>
  <p key="7ca93930-c2df-4d41-abf7-f4d9803d3c13">
   Shoto restrains Ending with his ice and the civilians who were saved express their gratitude to Deku. Katsuki quickly checks on the situation and then turns around to challenge Endeavor's big winter assignment. Endeavor admits the boys have done excellent work and were able to step up when he fumbled. Endeavor apologizes to Natsuo, horrifying Ending, who was expecting the old mean Flame Hero. Endeavor's driver points out that he's been targeted twice in just a few days and there is plenty of darkness lurking out in the world. Now optimistic about the future, Endeavor believes that the future heroes shed a light brighter than any threat that may come their way.
