   Yoichi Shigaraki is the younger brother of All For One. In the past, All For One deeply loved and cared about his younger brother, as he was the only family he had. However, All For One would insult Yoichi, labeling him as pathetic and fragile as he had his bodyguard go easy on him before imprisoning him. In return, Yoichi had a strong sense of justice and did not back down from opposing his brother's evil deeds. All For One refused to kill his brother and instead imprisoned him, in hopes he would join his side. To end his rebellion and make him powerful, All For One attempted to get him to submit by giving him a

  </p>
  <p key="99cb21de-6cd2-44f0-b76d-ceab6be3bf75">
   It is unknown if All For One killed his brother in battle, but the latter's Quirk was passed down to a vigilante, in the hopes that someone in the future would eventually stop his evil older brother once and for all. Because of his brother passing on the Quirk, All For One sought One For All with each successor failing to defeat him.

   One century later, All For One meets Yoichi in the world of One For All, when Tomura attempted to steal the Quirk from Izuku. All For One rebukes Yoichi's decision to remain with Izuku, calling the latter unworthy of such incredible power. Yoichi retorts that All For One can never comprehend Izuku's resolve of self-sacrifice and that is the reason One For All will follow the young hero. Yoichi and Nana Shimura expel All For One and Tomura from the world of One For All, thwarting their attempt to steal the Quirk yet again.

  <p key="cf74a61d-1317-4d0c-9f3b-433907619135">
   It's possible that one of the reasons All For One desires One For All, besides its power, is to reunite with his younger brother through his vestige, since he failed to bring him to his side in the real world.

   All For One groomed Tomura as his successor. He was the one who rescued Tomura from the streets after the incident of killing his family during his childhood.
  </p>
  <p key="5a5bbb69-761d-4394-96de-42706ca8de21">
   It's later revealed and heavily implied by Yoichi that the main reason All For One groomed Tomura to be so hateful of the world and of All Might was in order to foster a hateful will; through a stronger willpower, it would be possible to overcome the will of a One For All user, bypassing it's natural resistance to being stolen.
  </p>
  <p key="35383c70-db92-4f99-9720-52faa599730f">
   All For One is deeply invested in Tomura's growth and was pleased when Tomura finally developed a plan to achieve a goal on his own. Although well aware of his immaturity, he works to mold him into the successor he dreams of him being. When the police and Pro Heroes capture Tomura, All For One retaliates with force before teleporting Tomura and his friends to safety.
  </p>
  <p key="a58518fc-0ebd-446a-bd65-2122d559375a">
   It is unknown whether Tomura is aware or cares that All For One killed his grandmother, however, it does appear that All For One truly cares for Tomura, having a similar relationship like All Might has with Izuku. All For One even allowed Tomura to carry on his family name, Shigaraki, when renaming him. Instead of punishing Tomura as any archetypal

   would do to their apprentice, All For One instead encourages Tomura to simply start over as many times as he needed to and that he will always provide him with help. His care goes so far as to urge Tomura and his friends to leave the battlefield with All Might, keeping the Symbol of Peace distracted and entrusting Tomura to continue the fight in his stead.
  </p>
  <p key="52e91d74-4c04-4456-8e8f-6ca14e1b5a2e">
   Although All For One groomed Tomura with the intention to demoralize All Might and even scorn the lineage of Nana Shimura, it is evident that he supposedly grew to care for his adoptive son and is the only person to whom he has shown genuine love to, besides his brother, even if greatly motivated by evil.
  </p>
  <p key="f5a0c9ae-8152-4f08-933b-feaacd30874a">
   After Tomura received the All for One Quirk, All For One (or at least a vestige of him in the Quirk) attempted to take control of Tomura's body, and use it to steal the One For All Quirk from Izuku during his battle with him. Tomura regained control and rebuked his master, saying he wanted to follow his own will, and become greater than he was.
  </p>
  <p key="eeaefcc5-54b2-414a-b59e-ee15ea71dd6f">
   Tomura begins to hate All For One when the latter repeatedly attempts to take over his body to steal One For All. All For One doesn't mind though as he cheers on Tomura while he resists his control as it proves that Tomura is strong enough to be his successor. He later advises Tomura to retreat and let his body heal while he waits for his body to adjust to his new power. As the battle continues, however, All For One once again takes control of Tomura's body, noting that the more hatred Tomura has in his heart, the more his consciousness takes hold of his protege's body. All For One remarks how Tomura should pay back for losing to Endeavor and Deku, saying that it is all for his sake; this implies that All For One only saw Tomura simply as a crux to regain power and had no true affection for him.
  </p>
  <p key="d82575f6-9db5-401e-baeb-8130f2587351">
   This is further shown when he called himself in Tartarus his "real body", implying that he sees Tomura as nothing more than an additional host for his consciousness. When Tomura attempted to regain control, All For One refused, stating that this was the fruit of Tomura's labors, and when he refused to be a pawn, All For One replied that he was no mere pawn and someone very "near and dear to him". However, when he finally escaped Tartarus he stated that this is the story of how he would become a more perfect demon lord. This heavily implies that he had no affection for Tomura, and after his body was heavily damaged by All Might, he spent all those years of raising him and nurturing his hatred in order to both gain a new, healthier and stronger body and use Tomura's hatred in order to steal One For All thus allowing All For One to rise once again by taking permanent control of Tomura's body giving him even greater power than before.
  </p>
  <p key="5501a258-7ebf-425d-9926-040e20c6cfb5">
   This would make sense as All For One is notorious for manipulating people for his own benefit and often enlightening them with false promises and motivations.

  </p>
  <p key="3cd88381-3523-488c-aceb-ce82a5ea5198">
   In spite of this, when conversing with Spinner, All For One said that he greatly respected Tomura's will, and that once Tomura's body healed, all their desires would come to fruition; this could insinuate that even if All For One never cared for Tomura personally, at the very least he respects Tomura and his resolve, as well as the wishes of his allies, although he could have just told this to Spinner to put him at ease.
   Additionally, while All For One is trying to remake himself using Tomura's body, he is also seemingly okay with Tomura being stronger than him. At the very least, he is reluctantly willing to let Tomura usurp him as the true user of All For One and the Symbol of Evil if it comes to that, but Tomura must prove himself to be stronger.
  </p>
  <p key="0addefc8-76e1-4e2f-b00b-91d73d8e329a">
   It is eventually revealed that All For One wishes to merge his own consciousness with that of Tomura’s so they can both combine into a stronger, evil entity altogether. While Tomura is vehemently against this and continues to fight his former master’s control, All For One praises his former protégé while saying that all the hatred he had built up over the years is speeding up the process of his new body’s completion and them combining to become the ultimate evil. At this point, All For One expresses a twisted form of pride towards Tomura, praising him for exceeding his expectations yet willing to fuse with him against his will.

However, Toya viciously denies him, saying he has no intention of being trained by anyone else. Toya doesn't want All For One to be his master, and thus, All For One was unable to exploit his obsession with his father.

   Even after being captured, All For One continues to play with and taunt All Might, using any and every opportunity to strike at his nemesis. Despite being defeated by the latter, All For One took his loss in stride and mocked All Might for not dying when he had the chance, confident that his pupil will become stronger to take over the League of Villains. All For One is also aware of the fact that Izuku Midoriya is the current bearer of One For All and criticizes All Might for being a pathetic teacher.

   . It was a rare thing for All For One to have some respect for heroes and Endeavor was one of them. Essentially, he sees Endeavor as a hero would become obsessed with surpassing All Might in terms of strength and power, and recognizes him as a man of power. Nonetheless, he still treats Endeavor as nothing more than nuisance like all the other heroes.

   All For One mocks Endeavor for failing his role as a father, and having Shoto face off against Dabi, one of the strongest villains in the army. He often wonders why would Endeavor allow his youngest son to deal with his eldest when he knows that it was all because of him that lead Toya to become Dabi in the first place.

   When he fights against him and the heroes, Endeavor and the Heroes receive word that Dabi has been defeated by Shoto, causing him to react. In response, All For One comments on Endeavor's face, taunting him that he allowed his youngest son to take the burden of defeating his eldest sibling. Hawks tells Endeavor not to listen, expecting his upcoming verbal assault, while All For One continues, berating him for not even looking at Toya and letting Shoto handle everything, confidently stating that is why he'll never win. To further pester the hero, All For One revealed his role in Toya's disappearance, allowing him to catch the enraged hero off guard and attack him.

   All For One recognizes Star and Stripe as a huge threat to his plans of global conquest. Upon hearing of her sudden arrival, he decided to fight her himself despite Tomura's body not being fully ready, out of fear of her collaborating with Izuku Midoriya. The fact that he planned to steal One For All before confronting her proves how much of a threat All For One viewed her as. During his fight with the hero, he becomes eager to test out the limits of her Quirk, New Order. After she unleashes her final move upon "Tomura", he admits that any other move would've finished him, but then derides her over her failure while saying he would make better use of her resources.

   After stealing New Order, "Tomura" mocks the hero by agreeing with the pilot who called her an idiot. However, before he prepares to use New Order, All For One sees the vestige of Star and Stripe going wild, tearing apart the other vestiges and destroying "Tomura's" body, thanks to the final rule placed onto New Order which caused it to revolt against other Quirks. All For One is infuriated, completely caught off-guard by this and unable to do anything to stop New Order from destroying his body. In the mental world, All For One curses her, viewing her as the specter of All Might. Star and Stripe is the only hero besides All Might that has managed to make All For One lose his composure.

Izuku, on the other hand, prepared to eventually go up against One For All's mortal enemy.

   In the vestige world, All For One mocked Izuku's altruism as a weakness and claimed that All Might made a mistake choosing him as a successor. Yoichi and Nana, however, fought back against him, rebutting that Izuku's perceived weakness is exactly why he was chosen for this power. All For One fails in stealing One For All, and while he acknowledges Izuku as a threat to his plans, he is still dismissive of the young hero.

He threatened Yuga and his parents with death should they have disobeyed or lied to him, and even showed them an example of what became of someone who once ratted him out; a man who went to the police and was killed when he was released from prison. As a result, All For One had sewn a strong fear into the Aoyama family, as well as a strong and horrible guilt within Yuga for having betrayed his classmates and putting them in danger.
