   The Underground Masquerade is an illegal event that organizes guerrilla fighting tournaments that pit fighters against each other and run the books for the betting audience.

   After a short fight, Iwao lets himself win and pretends to be unconscious to be taken to another room where injured fighters are supposedly healed. Once there, he “regains” consciousness, and a medical staff member offers him the opportunity to be injected with a special Quirk-booster drug.
   Iwao drops the act, and uses his

   Iwao plans to sneak out but runs into Kendo waiting for him. He considers that his previous victory was not right as he The Ripper didn't have his heart in the fight, so he hands him half of the prize money. He then challenges for a proper fight, but Iwao, still as The Ripper, quickly declines. As they walking, they hear loud noises coming from the arena. When they arrive, they see that the cause of all that fuss is a young

   All For One had been watching the fights from the security room. He had considered leaving there, but after the turn of events caused by Rumi, he decides to decides to harvest some Quirks with the help of

   .
   Suddenly the alarm goes off, followed by a gas starting to pour into the arena. Those who breathe the gas receive a Quirk boost as they lose control and go wild. To prevent anyone from fleeing,  All For One locks all the doors to the passages and emergency stairwell, and deploys his subordinates protected with gas masks to ensure that no one can flee. Then, with the help of Kurogiri and his

  </p>
  <p key="7264748c-353d-4c81-8d6e-d49ef8d6194b">
   Despite the chaos, Iwao sees AFO's hand emerging from a Kurogiri’s mist to snatch Quirks, and when he notices that the mist is going after Rumi, he uses his Overclock Quirk to quickly jump in and snag her out of the place, avoiding the Kurogiri's dark fog, and returned to where Kendo was. Then, he revealed to him and Rumi that he was the Speed Hero: O'Clock and requested their assistance. Iwao steals three gas masks from some staff for himself and his impromptu allies, as well a prop gun. Then he briefs them about how they are going to escape.
  </p>
  <p key="4b086849-806f-4097-81e8-756d8cf709a9">
   Iwao inform them that there is an exit, but he’s concerned by the black fog that can snatch Quirks, so he askes Kendo and Rumi to make their way while also acting as a decoy, although he request them to not use their full powers on people transformed by the gas.
   He also comes up with a plan B, in case something unforeseen happens, and instructs Rumi to escape the facility and get the police squad outside to contact Detective Eizo and ask him to call in

  <p key="c66edced-75db-446b-82f6-30a8d4e524fc">
   Kendo and Rumi open the way with Iwao behind them, shooting the security cameras after correctly deducing that whoever is controlling the dark mist isn't currently there. In the control room, All For One is surprised to find that he is losing more and more cameras, as it may interfere with his plans to collect Quirks. However, he was prepared for any contingency as he had already sent a

  </p>
  <p key="7bf269c1-d456-47df-9047-afc7a4880d33">
   All For One sees the battle as best he can, annoyed because the prevailing chaos and the numerous destroyed cameras limit his vision. He wonders  if he should intervene in person to take over the Quirks, but Kurogiri advises against it, because it could attract the attention of All Might. This concern matters little, since considering that the Hooded Man is a foe too complicated to take down on their own, Iwao puts Plan B into motion. While he and Kendo distract Hooded Man, Rumi manages to escape the building and contact Eizo outside, giving him the message from O'Clock to call All Might.
  </p>
  <p key="f2d35862-9bcc-43c9-8c56-6a0dc2b11a02">
   Acceding to the Pro Hero's request, Eizo activates the Might Signal, turning all of the local mascots and advertisements into All Mights, which immediately sends an emergency dispatch request to his private office in the
   Might Tower
   . After receiving the request, All Might immediately blasts off to solve the threat. Kurogiri informs All For One that since All Might is on his way, they should retreat, but All For One opts for another solution to buy time, and thus have the opportunity to steal the Overclock Quirk from Iwao, after identifying him as the hero O'Clock.
  </p>
  <p key="530b9bd9-5aea-4ae2-a901-0474a8f14dde">
   With the help of Kurogiri and his Warping Gate, All For One places his hand on several individuals in the underground arena, utilizing his powers on each of them to boost their Quirk, transforming them into violent instant villains,
   who break out the parking structure, running and rampaging through the Osaka streets, causing all kind of mayhem. The police and local heroes can hardly hold them back, but fortunately All Might arrives, and in no time, he defeats and handcuff all the villains by himself. Then he asks Detective Eizo if he needs anything else.
  </p>
  <p key="1e93a6fe-afb6-44cf-82a2-012bf1602179">
   In their hiding place, Kurogiri is lamenting that the diversion barely bought them anytime, but All For One gleefully responds that it bought them "three seconds". Back in the parking structure, Iwao and Kendo continue fighting against Hooded Man, between them they manage to cause problems, but the situation is turned upside down when Hooded Man begins to use a piece of the ring as a weapon, knocking Kendo down and about to do the same with Iwao.
  </p>
  <p key="f90af2fd-f197-49b3-a885-cd0a00028bb5">
   That's the moment All For One was expecting, but his plans are frustrated when Rumi returns after All Might solves the problems outside. She knocks the Hooded Man to the ground with a swift kick. The Hooded Man gets back up enraged, swearing that he's going to kill them all in order to become the strongest. However, Kurogiri uses his Quirk to quickly retrieve the Hooded Man, as the few seconds their diversion gave them got wasted by Rumi' sneak attack, allowing All Might to arrive, much to All For One's irritation.
  </p>
  <p key="b59602ab-4ff5-4edd-bcbe-ca1d298e2b91">
   When All Might finally arrives, he gets confused when checking that there are no problems there. Tiger Bunny informs him the main villain got away, while O'Clock thinks to himself about what's going on.
  </p>
  <p key="ced65698-e55a-4e95-94c7-22ce0d4c3825">
   With the crisis solved, the citizens of Osaka rejoice and congratulates All Might for his help, who also tops a new record in defeating nearly 100 villains in one fell swoop, as well as assisting in many aspects of the clean up. With everything resolved All Might before leaps off and heading back the Might Tower to have a proper rest.
