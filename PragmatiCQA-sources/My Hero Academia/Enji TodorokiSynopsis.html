   Quirk. Despite not inheriting his mother's ice Quirk to overcome the downside of overheating, he still planned on raising him to be a hero. He still sought a child who would inherit the Quirks of fire and ice, and Rei wanted more children, believing they could encourage each other, which ultimately led to

   's birth. Sadly, she only inherited Rei's ice Quirk, but he was still happy either way, because he felt that since Toya had more potential, he could place all his ambitions on him.
  </p>
  <p key="6697937f-f62d-4c5f-8c78-e35ff6b72533">
   However, his plans were cut short when he discovered that Toya inherited the weak physical constitution of his mother, which made him vulnerable to heat and therefore the use of his Fire Quirk will cause degrees of burns on his skin if he abused it. No longer wanting to train him and being unable to make Toya himself quit, Enji decided to have more children hoping Toya would finally give up on his ambition to become a Hero, which ultimately led to the birth of his third child,

   .
   It is implied that around that time, Endeavor's obsession with conceiving the perfect child, who would inherit both his Hellflame Quirk and Rei's Ice Quirk, grew, and signs of his attitude and relationship towards his family began to worsen.
  </p>
  <p key="ed199b8d-162c-4276-88bf-11e1fba7bef8">
   Enji eventually found his "masterpiece" in his fourth child, Shoto, pushing aside and ignoring the rest of his children who he deemed as failures.
   This rejection especially affected Toya, who was secretly continuing his training to regain his father's affection. Enji told him to stop because he is hurting himself, and advised him to look beyond the world of being a hero and do things like play with his siblings or make friends at school. Crying, Toya replied that he can't, after all, he was the one who lit the fire in him to surpass All Might, teaching him to never give up and that the flame inside of him won't go out.
  </p>
  <p key="4d298ac5-0b5a-464c-af01-1590d829ff04">
   When the rest of the family came to see what was happening, Toya tells his father to look at him as he charged with his flames activated at his mother carrying an infant Shoto.
   He was stopped before he could hurt anyone, but after Toya's outburst, Enji decided to ban the other Todoroki siblings from interacting with Shoto so he can focus on his training, and entrusted Rei to look after Toya. When Rei said that all Toya wants is for his father to acknowledge him, Enji replied that all he can show anyone is the world of heroes, to which Rei scathingly replied that he is just running away from his problems.
  </p>
  <p key="501dd47e-62fb-41ce-a3fb-5a39e922334c">
   When Shoto was five years old, Enji began training him to become a Hero. However, the training was harsh and detestable. Rei tried to defend Shoto, saying that he was too young, but Enji refused to listen and ordered her to stay out of his way, hitting her for interfering. Enji also prevented Shoto from interacting with his older brothers and sister.
  </p>
  <p key="973d336b-d345-4808-83a8-b9dfaea48956">
   Meanwhile, Toya continued to train until one day, during the winter season, his Quirk evolved and became stronger with his flames turning blue. Shortly afterwards, excited to show his father how he had developed, Toya asked him to come to
   Sekoto Peak
   the next time he had a day off. Enji, however, lifted up his shirt and saw his burned scars, angry that Toya had been training again, but his son was adamant that he was destined for greatness and determined to make his father proud of him. Frustrated, Enji ignored his eldest son's pleas and hit Rei for not stopping Toya, causing Shoto to yell at him to not bully her. Enji told his youngest son to stay out of it. Rei confessed to her husband that she couldn't stop Toya.
  </p>
  <p key="e17c7f10-4d6a-4b6d-9525-0077ee1ca278">
   His worsening behavior began to affect Rei, to the point that she began to see her husband's face in her children,
   until one day she snapped and threw boiling water at Shoto's face. After this incident, Enji had her admitted to a mental hospital. After learning of this, Shoto angrily blamed him for what happened to his mother.
  </p>
  <p key="601aaae2-9596-414a-94fd-cc43d57285ec">
   Shortly after Rei's hospitalization, Toya went back to Sekoto Peak, expecting his father to come to see his new powers, but he didn't appear. At the time, Enji thought it would only throw fuel onto Toya's ambitions, but in truth, he didn't know what to say to him. Either way, him not showing up caused Toya to lose control of his emotions, and therefore his flames, resulting in a massive wildfire. Enji could only watch from afar the massive fire in horror, knowing that Toya was there. When the fire was extinguished, Enji was amongst the mob watching the aftermath.
   Toya was believed to have been burned alive from the flames exceeding 2000 degrees Celsius, since only a part of his lower jawbone was ever found. Enji rushed to the scene in horror and searched for his son but was unable to find him, believing he had been killed in the blaze.
  </p>
  <p key="fa8a6ffd-9019-45b6-b1ad-3c811e0df66a">
   His death affected his family, especially his mother Rei, whose mental state had already been harshly affected by her husband's past abuse, and his brother Natsuo, who still considers his father responsible for Toya's demise. The family installed a Butsudan Buddhist altar in his former room after his passing and still send their prayers to him. Even Enji is seen praying at it, saying that he regrets the loss of his eldest son, going as far as to admit that he got him killed.
   Despite this tragedy, Enji did not let go of his ambitions, believing that he couldn't abandon them after killing his son. He soon became obsessed on training Shoto and molding him into his perfect successor.
  </p>
  <p key="3312418f-ac3b-4066-8bdc-6950023dd778">
   Unbeknownst to Enji and his family, Toya never died, instead ending up on the path of villainy and renaming himself

   organizes a meeting in the Police Station with some of the heroes who helped to stop the outbreak to discuss the situation and the best action to take. Eizo explains that the Instant Villains were innocent people who were turned against their will. Endeavor understands that what he means is that they are more victims than villains, so he proposes that both he and the rest of the heroes who helped stop the outbreak pay their hospital bills, and for the media to just make sure that they tread lightly when reporting this.

   But Eizo not only wants that but also that the heroes do not rush when it comes to facing an Instant Villain, in case it is another innocent person. Endeavor considers his request ridiculous and argues that any public use of a Quirk is illegal and that they should treat them as villains and let the police investigate the backgrounds of future captures. He says that this is the only way to protect the innocent while not risking themselves through hesitating every time they see a new enemy.

   Endeavor begins to suffer from fatigue due to overusing his Quirk. A group of Heroes come to his aid and extinguish his body with firehoses. Naomasa arrives and sees the Hero slowing down in momentum, and warns others to pull back as Bee☆Pop is headed their way with her explosions. Endeavor refuses to simply back down and instead commands the detective to deploy the Police Force, to which Naomasa replies that they will be ready. Endeavor angrily declares that he will burn everything down, including Bee☆Pop and The Crawler.

   By the time Endeavor recovers from his fatigue, Koichi had managed to break Pop☆Step out of the Queen Bee's control. However, Pop☆Step had been shot with a bullet by Number 6, which would order the Bomb Bees and the Queen Bee to explode. Koichi begins to run away from Number 6 (who is pretending to be a hero named O'Clock II), with the latter pursuing him as the bees behind him explode. Up ahead, Koichi and Number 6 notice Endeavor, who is ready to resume his confrontation.

   Endeavor notices that The Crawler is carrying an injured Pop☆Step, so as long as he is carrying her, The Crawler can only hop around. Endeavor states that Koichi won't get away, and that he is just an All Might hoodie-wearing punk. Koichi, realizing that he has no other choice, decides that he cannot stop nor waste time to save Pop☆Step.

  <p key="813fae59-1384-46c1-8f4e-c58ff3770235">
   Number 6, who had yet to be noticed by Endeavor, tries to use this situation in his favor by killing Koichi when he leaves the main street into an alley. To the villain's surprise, Koichi neither stops nor swerves, and instead dives right into Endeavor.
  </p>
  <p key="a65b14cf-4626-4193-8498-103c3d588aea">
   Seeing The Crawler darting straight towards him, Endeavor starts shooting fireballs at him, to which Koichi dodges as best he can. Number 6, seeing that things aren't going the way he wants, considers announcing his presence to Endeavor, as he wouldn't get any credit for taking down Koichi otherwise.
  </p>
  <p key="059b841b-4e30-4236-86c0-1f39204e2429">
   At one point while dodging, a fireball causes Koichi's hood to fly up. Enraged by seeing the antennas, which resemble All Might, Endeavor uses his Super Move,

   With no intention of letting them escape, Endeavor hurries towards the place where he saw The Crawler land. Once there he finds Midnight holding an unconscious Bee☆Pop in her arms. With her are her sidekicks and as well as a trio of young men. Midnight explains to Endeavor that the villain Bee☆Pop has been captured and that she urgently needs medical care. Endeavor then asks her about The Crawler and Midnight replies that he managed to run away.

   Endeavor ponders for a few seconds and allows them to take Pop to the hospital. He is sure that there is something bigger in the whole thing, and that Kazuho may have answers, so he needs her alive to be able to interrogate her. When he is left alone in the alley, he tries to find some clue about the vigilantes but he finds that there is no one there and leaves the place, but not before crushing a water pipe to cool his fire down, frustrated that The Crawler has managed to escape.
   In the aftermath of the incident, Endeavor is credited for taking down Pop☆Step, although his actions were met with mixed reactions by the public.

   In the blink of an eye, All Might blasts his way down into Naruhata past Endeavor, shooting all the mini bombers into the air in an instant. With the mini bombers in the air safely, Endeavor laments how brazen he is and that he'll get no thanks from him, unleashing his Flashfire Fist: Prominence Burn attack, completely decimating the bombers.

   All Might says that they have not spoken to each other in ten years and he wants to catch up. Endeavor angrily tells him to get lost and to stop acting like old friends. As Endeavor leaves, All Might says that Shoto was able to perform well using half his power and asks for advice on how to raise the next generation of heroes. Endeavor dismisses his request and states Shoto will be a hero that will surpass All Might even though he is going through his rebellious phase. He walks away after disconcerting All Might by saying it is the reason he "created" Shoto.

   Prior to the final round, Endeavor confronts Shoto before his match with Hanta Sero. He berates his son, telling Shoto that he could have easily taken first in the first and second rounds of the festival had he used his flames. Endeavor reminds Shoto that his purpose is to surpass All Might and that unlike his siblings, Shoto is his greatest masterpiece. This only angers Shoto, who replies that he will not give Endeavor the satisfaction and only use his mother's Quirk. As Shoto excuses himself, Endeavor tells him that even if that works for the festival, Shoto will eventually find the limits of that power.

As Izuku tries to excuse himself, Endeavor tells him that Shoto has a duty to usurp All Might and this next match will prove to be an excellent benchmark. He asks Izuku to hit Shoto hard, and to do his best not to disgrace either of them. He apologizes for interrupting Izuku and prepares to leave, but is halted when Izuku states he is not All Might. Izuku goes on to say that Shoto may be his son, but he is not Endeavor. Endeavor is slightly annoyed, and goes to the tournament arena to watch the match.

Shoto states that the only reason he used his fire power was because for a split second, he completely forgot about Endeavor, and then walks away saying that perhaps he no longer needs his father. Endeavor watches begrudgingly as Shoto defeats Tenya using only his ice, pondering why Shoto feels the need to keep holding back.

   ; this announcement is being held at Kamino for its importance and is special for the fact that All Might will not be on the chart for the first time as well as the top ten Heroes themselves appearing on stage for the presentation of their rankings. The new Number One Hero is revealed to be the same Hero who temporarily received the ranking; it is none other than the Flame Hero Endeavor who is wearing a new Hero costume.

   , asks Endeavor what it is like to be the Number One Hero, but receives a glare from the Flame Hero. Remembering what All Might advised him, Endeavor says one thing; to just watch him. This surprises the Heroes in the stadium as Hawks claps.
  </p>
  <p key="55f0f74b-bc9c-4be0-b72c-999d35180fde">
   Back stage, an angry Endeavor confronts Hawks and is not too pleased with his behavior. Hawks convinces Endeavor that he was simply trying to make an impact so that Endeavor could look better. Hawks reveals that he was never an All Might fan and never wanted to be like him but his retirement was a big shock to him. Hawks believes that society does not need an icon Hero like All Might but a leader with a mental fortitude to support them all, believing that Endeavor has such a quality and is impressed by him.
  </p>
  <p key="7e852773-6e9a-41e5-8b63-5b0fd45ad83f">
   Although he is not able to tell if Hawks is being truthful, sarcastic, or mocking him, Endeavor wonders why Hawks does not become this leader, to which Hawks admits that he would rather be lower in the rankings so that he would have more freedom. Unimpressed with Hawks' immaturity, Endeavor bluntly states his displeasure for Hawks and ends their conversation, telling him to apologize to everyone else.
  </p>
  <p key="14436719-aed6-4ac7-9ba8-d922a53a203d">
   As Endeavor walks away, Hawks tells Endeavor the reason he wanted to talk to him; in his area the number of concerning sightings has been making him worry and he would like to team up with the Number 1 Hero. These sightings have to do with Nomus, which catches Endeavor's attention.

   While walking the streets of
   Fukuoka
   , a
   villain
   is struck down by Hawks' red feathers. As he strikes down the villain, Hawks tells Endeavor about a restaurant they can eat at so that they can discuss business. A dog is almost run over by a truck but Hawks' red feathers carry the dog to safety, all the while Hawks is busy occupied with his talk with Endeavor. Soon, the public takes note of Hawks' rare appearance and some of them take photos with him while Endeavor nonchalantly stands by.
  </p>
  <p key="183f4c5c-36d7-4484-90d8-aabba3dd5009">
   The people take notice of Endeavor but are reluctant to make contact with him;
   one boy
   bets his friend to ask for Endeavor's autograph. Seeing this, Endeavor welcomes this and allows the boy to approach him. However, the boy is taken aback by Endeavor's new attitude and believes that him being a gruff and angry Hero suited him better and shies away as his friend apologizes for him, while the event leaves Endeavor confused.
  </p>
  <p key="c0ffd96f-30fc-4a8d-a080-abc90d7a2142">
   At the Umai Building, Hawks tells Endeavor that after U.A's Sports Festival he sent an offer to his son Shoto. However, Hawks is happy that
   <a href="Fumikage Tokoyami.html" key="a2587b8f-703d-4eeb-80a9-0f352567e51b" title="Fumikage Tokoyami">
    Fumikage
   </a>
   was the one who ended up coming since Shoto failed the Provisional Hero License Exam and having that would have ruined his image, much to Endeavor's anger who finds it strange that Hawks has knowledge of that despite not being a U.A. graduate. Having had enough of the useless talk, Endeavor wants to know about the rumors Hawks has been hearing.
  </p>
  <p key="d5c61b75-7d62-4b97-a20e-9060d9958a89">
   Hawks knows that the League of Villains puppets, the modified humans called Nomus, were stored in a facility in Kamino Ward but after they were captured along with All For One they have rarely appeared. However, Hawks isn't able to confirm that the rumors are true, which infuriates Endeavor who tries to leave. Hawks informs Endeavor that the rumors aren't just in his area but the entire country as he has heard it from wives gossiping or school children chatting on the way home.
  </p>
  <p key="5d630a13-a4ce-4acb-8a0e-c7628c42be01">
   Hawks secretly launched an investigation with the Police Force but they came up dry and after investigating himself by flying throughout the country, all he heard of was rumors. Although never managing to find proof, Hawks, after hearing that everyone knows about Nomus, believes that someone is going around spreading these rumors to strike panic into the public and knows this to be true because the villain they encountered on the way was influenced by a reprinting of Destro's autobiography. Hawks desires for Endeavor to become a leader that can lay these rumors to rest and tell the populace to take it easy. Hawks wants to live in an ideal world where all Heroes can take leisure in their work without ever stressing out, wanting Heroes to have more free time.
  </p>
  <p key="497e2c25-ba42-4e23-aaf7-c6ef880befd4">
   Suddenly, Hawks and Endeavor notice that something is flying to them; it is the intelligent Nomu,
   <a href="Hood.html" key="2d1f3e0c-c624-4f73-b8ae-1daacec2b686" title="Hood">
    Hood
   </a>
   , who is flying towards them. The waitress comes in as Hawks protects her and Endeavor tells the Number Two Hero to evacuate the building. The High-End Nomu smashes in and asks which of them is the strongest. Endeavor notes that the rumors were true and is glad that this was well timed.
  </p>
  <p key="4a6b909e-fce5-4e71-bd1c-e73bc76be691">
   Hood prepares to attack but Endeavor takes the initiative first by attacking with Flashfire Fist - Jet Burn, a blast of fire that sends Hood out of the building and damages it. Endeavor takes flight by propelling himself in the air with his fire. Endeavor plans to show the Nomu what it means to be the Number One Hero.
  </p>
  <p key="1e6b891e-7360-46de-b7ad-9b393dc6d60c">
   Endeavor continues to face off against Hood while Hawks is surprised that Endeavor can fly to which Endeavor responds that he considers it "not falling" and warns him to not underestimate the Nomu they are facing. When Hood starts regenerating, Endeavor sees that he possesses a regeneration Quirk similar to other black Nomus while the white Nomus don't have any special Quirks and assumes that the black Nomus are high quality Nomus with many powerful Quirks. Endeavor deduces that the Nomu to be special among the black Nomus since it can speak. Resolving to capture Nomu alive for interrogation, Endeavor uses Flashfire Fist - Hell Spider, launching five streams of fire from his finger tips.
  </p>
  <p key="c9b9e536-ece9-45b7-a338-86d22b9550cf">
   Although two fire streams hit Hood, it doesn't stop its advance and it lunges into Endeavor, plunging Endeavor into the building with great force and sends him to the other side of it. Endeavor releases a great flare of fire that burns Hood's arm, causing it to release Endeavor from its grip. Suddenly, Hood's arm regenerates immediately and grabs hold of Endeavor once again and proceeds to smash him across the building. The High-End Nomu sends Endeavor out of the building. Endeavor gets a hold of himself and takes note of the creature prowess.
  </p>
  <p key="107e96ee-8b37-43c8-9c5b-da4183eaf02c">
   Due to Hood smashing Endeavor across the building, the top half of the building begins collapsing. Hawks uses his Quirk,
   <a href="Fierce Wings.html" key="73159eb4-1598-4a22-b7bb-7e4cbdda6740" title="Fierce Wings">
    Fierce Wings
   </a>
   which allows him to control and manipulate strong and flexible feathers, to get all the injured civilians out of the building first. As Hawks' feathers begin delivering the injured down to safety, Hawks himself joins the fight and launches three feathers at Hood which successfully strikes its arm. Endeavor uses an advanced version of Flashfire Fist - Hell Spider and strikes Hood with multiple fire streams which cuts up its body. Hawks wonders if this move is Endeavor's strongest to which Endeavor comments about it not even being close. The cut up Hood begins regenerating and comments on the fight being interesting.
  </p>
  <p key="395a518c-7406-494e-9fcd-12758d7ee832">
   To prevent any other heroes from interrupting his fight with Endeavor, Hood
   spawns several minor Nomus
   to deal with them, while regenerating his body completely. The High-End Nomu wonders if Endeavor stopped shooting flames since he isn't able to anymore due to a limitation. Begrudgingly, Endeavor accepts Hood's intuition about his Quirk; the more flames he produces, the more heat continually builds up in his body which raises his body temperature and causes his physical abilities to deteriorate and he already knows he is inferior in power and speed to begin with. Endeavor recalls that he started a family for his Quirk's major drawback.
  </p>
  <p key="87593da4-bcf5-45b9-844d-f4a285caf988">
   Hood reveals another Quirk and is excited to use it on Endeavor. While evading Hood's stretching arms, Endeavor has no choice but to end the battle quickly since he cannot maintain an elongated battle due to his Quirk's drawback. Endeavor ignites viciously and releases a powerful fire blast called
   Prominence Burn
   which incinerates Hood's body completely.
  </p>
  <p key="46bcfff9-85c2-440f-ba66-4ad84644c58b">
   Suddenly, Endeavor sees Hood's head and neck and realizes that it tore it off to avoid completely being incinerated. While regenerating, Hood attacks the recuperating Endeavor by impaling his torso and striking him in the face, potentially destroying his left eye. The rest of the Todoroki Family watch the broadcast of the event.
  </p>
  <p key="051012cb-110a-4663-86f9-e556bde9562d">
   Still conscious in spite of his injuries, Endeavor uses his flames to lift himself and he attempts to attack Hood. However, the High-End Nomu evades the strike and sends the pro hero flying into a building but Endeavor refuses to give in. Using his quirk once more, Endeavor projects himself after the Nomu who wonders if he has regeneration but Endeavor was aware that his body was immobile and he is only raising his flames to propel himself and needs a strategy to kill the Nomu since it was impossible to merely capture it. Hawks then uses his feathers to enhance Endeavor's speed, allowing Endeavor to be launched at the villain.
  </p>
  <p key="337743e7-5f70-4f66-890a-b8ea29f79029">
   Thrust by Hawks' feathers, Endeavor uses the speed to attack Hood sending them both through the air. He takes note of the Nomu's behavior which is similar to that of a wild beast before noticing his regenerative powers were still active and screams for Hawks to give him more speed to help. After Hawks does so and says that his feathers are practically ash, Endeavor states it is more than enough and uses it to send him and the Nomu far from the city.
  </p>
  <p key="f4635b56-223e-4eaf-99a1-ea9fd5dcf033">
   With nothing to stand in his way, Endeavor uses an enhanced version of Prominence Burn, dubbed "PLUS ULTRA Prominence Burn," noting he always hated his old school's motto, to destroy Hood for good. Endeavor emerges from the destruction and strikes a pose, similar to All Might's to show he is victorious. Hawks comes and the two share banter about the pose before moving to get help for Endeavor's wounds. However, they don't get very far as
   <a href="Dabi.html" key="65748880-f9dd-4f05-a79d-59db0c1cfb6b" title="Dabi">
    Dabi
   </a>

  </p>
  <p key="8a3b40a1-8067-4816-af5a-c36e596bb617">
   Endeavor recognizes Dabi through his blurred vision, shouting that Dabi was the one to kill

   </a>
   , even though Dabi does not remember who that is. After formally introducing himself, Dabi puts up a flame wall around the two heroes. Trying to muster up some strength, Endeavor is told by Hawks to rest and that he will take care of Dabi for the both of them.
  </p>
  <p key="5241662b-d21a-4254-95a7-23953cc77424">

   suddenly arrives on the scene and stops Dabi, who decides to call upon an ally to fall back. As he escapes, Dabi taunts Endeavor, referring to him by his full name, Enji Todoroki and wishes to speak with him again before vanishing from the area. With the threat gone, Endeavor blacks out as an announcer shouts the Hero duo's victory.

   Recovering at a hospital, a bandaged Endeavor is visited by Hawks.

   , which also saves his eye. However, he is left with a large scar on the left side of his face. Enji and Hawks leave the hospital, and Hawks apologizes to Enji for his injuries.
  </p>
  <p key="f10d5f40-6c8c-4f4c-8165-a922b9f50b49">
   Enji says that his injuries are his own responsibility, and asks Hawks if their encounter with Hood was truly a coincidence. Hawks, flustered by Enji's question, attributes the attack to their high profile presence in the area. Enji leaves as Hawks tells him to get some rest.
  </p>
  <p key="80f4ddeb-855b-42b2-b3dc-f5f784697a7d">
   Arriving at his
   home
   , Enji sees Fuyumi, Natsuo, and Shoto eating a meal. Fuyumi happily greets her father as he walks in, and congratulates him on his win against Hood. Shoto sarcastically compliments his father's new scar as he and Natsuo continue to be unenthusiastic around him as Fuyumi becomes frantic and Enji voices he can hear her.
  </p>
  <p key="957ed579-37ee-4a7e-93f1-7c5abec40643">
   Natsuo, unable to handle the tense situation, gets up to leave the room. Enji stops him and tells his son that if he has something to say, he can just say it. Stirred on by this, Natsuo unleashes his feelings onto him. Enji remains silent as Natsuo tells him that even though his mother and sister have seemingly forgiven him, he sees that he is still the same person who neglected his children and left them to listen to their mother screaming and brother crying. Natsuo then mentions their other sibling, Toya, and that just because Enji defeated a powerful villain, does not mean he has made up for what he has done. After Natsuo's rant ends, Enji calmly responds that he is going to face his past and atone for it.
  </p>
  <p key="8140e2bc-143f-4409-b9e7-d9003f9e8b38">
   These words are met with disgust and surprise by Natsuo who leaves as Fuyumi panics, recounting the events that led up this moment and frantically talking to Shoto that she was really happy at the progress she thought was being made and they might be family. A recap of witness testimonies from the battle plays on the television, with focus given to a particular boy who screamed encouragement from the crowd that watched the battle, which led to the crowd cheering Enji to win. Enji remembers the boy, and realizes that the cheering and motivation he received meant a lot to him.
  </p>
  <p key="b5f0bda4-9069-4b31-9bf8-bc43231dda88">
   Shoto catches his attention and tells him that Endeavor the hero is amazing, but while he agrees with everything Natsuo said, he still wants to see what kind of parent Enji will become. Shoto also tells him that he understands that a small amount of encouragement can completely alter someone. Hearing this, Enji recalls his brief talk with All Might after his retirement and strengthens his resolve to work towards the future of his family. He apologizes to Fuyumi and admits he used the wrong words with Natsuo just before.

   Internally, Endeavor gives his thanks to Fuyumi for helping him to register Shoto's account, as he wants to tell him something about the technique he tried to teach him years ago, although his son has ignored all his messages so far despite his efforts to change from his past self.

   At the end of a turn is a roadblock, where a group of Heroes and Endeavor wait for the League's armored truck to arrive. Dabi sees Endeavor and blasts off blue flames at him, and the latter uses his Flashfire Fist - Jet Burn, with both attacks colliding and canceling each other out. Shortly after, Dabi lets out a massive blast of his flames, to which Endeavor counters with his Prominence Burn. The move overpowers Dabi and engulfs the truck, causing the villains to melting, revealing them to be double created from Twice's Quirk. The truck reels of a cliff.

   The students meet with Endeavor on an overpass in the city. Endeavor looks seemingly happy to see them, but it was a facade and he quickly shows his annoyance at having Izuku and Katsuki as trainees, as he only begrudgingly accepted their offer cause he just wanted to work with Shoto. Katsuki says he always thought of Endeavor as being “cringey”, but he can let that slide if it means learning how the Number 1 Hero operates, causing Endeavor to shout at Shoto for not choosing his friends better.
  </p>
  <p key="4c3f409f-2461-4bf0-98be-9bda025c3bf5">
   While they walk down the street, Izuku thanks him for letting them do their work study with him; making Endeavor thinks back  the words that Izuku said to him at the Sports Festival, about “Shoto’s not him”, which he repeats outloud. Suddenly, Endeavor runs off telling them that he only cares about interning Shoto, as he jumps off the overpass, telling them to stand back and watch as he flies off. He looks back to see the three students are right behind him. Izuku asks him for his instructions. Endeavor repeats his order to stay behind him.

   The three students soon chase Endeavor through the city, but Endeavor, using Flashfire, is too fast for them to follow. In a business district, a villain called
   Starservant
   was causing havoc with his Glass Manipulation Quirk and had just launched a super move,
   Enlightened Fallen King
   sending a giant ball of glass flying down the street.

   Endeavor flies in and destroys the glass ball with Flashfire Fist, then confronts Starservant, who runs away.

   As the police arrive to take Starservant away, he starts saying that Endeavor is the root of the darkness that will consume the world, which seems to have some impact on him. He then asks Hawks why he was here. Hawks responds by promoting the Paranormal Liberation Front's book, saying it is a good read. Endeavor is taken aback, possibly under the impression that Hawks had defected to Destro's ideology.
  </p>
  <p key="edc55640-1a56-4c5b-9d62-ace7c3e90f32">
   Once at his agency, Endeavor leaves the three students with the "Flaming Sidekickers," while he locks himself in his office to read the book Hawks gave him. Endeavor noticed that there is something unusual about Hawks' expression while he is offering him Destro's autobiography. Hawks gives him the book asking him to make sure he reads it well, especially the lines that he underlined.

  <p key="b9967be7-d6fa-4811-b948-bcd92e9de23d">
   Endeavor recalls the conversation he had with him, before his
   battle against Shoto

   . Endeavor empathizes with him since, like him and his sons, he has a Quirk that's able to hurt himself and tells Izuku that he is like them. Izuku is confused by his words. Then Endeavor asks Katsuki what he wants to achieve, and he replies that he already has a powerful Quirk and a great mastery with it, and he just wants to find out what it is that he lacks in order to surpass the No. 1 Hero.
  </p>
  <p key="d88a4809-3d42-48a4-8afb-f91770e3c7b5">
   Endeavor concludes the presentations and wants to start the training already, but Shoto tells him that he didn't ask him. Endeavor is sure that his goal is to master the
   Flashfire Fist
   but Shoto is straight up with his father about what he thinks, saying that he comes to his agency is to use him and learn from him, but his true inspiration is All Might and tells him to stop trying to act like a father figure with him in front of his friends. Endeavor grieves at Shoto’s words. He thought Shoto was finally starting to forgive him, but he is wrong. After accepting this, he decides to start the training.
  </p>
  <p key="b866d7db-5f0b-4494-96b8-75b49fecd9e4">
   Endeavor goes out with his three interns. He tells them the three fundamentals of Hero Work: Rescue, Evacuation, and Battle. With his training, they will not only improve their skills and Quirks but also detect and stop the slightest threats before anyone else, keeping the damage to a minimum. Endeavor ends the lesson by telling Izuku, Shoto, and Katsuki that, during the winter break, their task is to beat a villain faster than him, even if only once.
  </p>
  <p key="55a71704-5ff7-4b59-98c4-b21c189d8f0c">
   Endeavor goes immediately into action upon receiving a warning call, being followed by his trainees. He captures without breaking a sweat a hit-and-runner who was driving a motorcycle through the alleys. Endeavor tells his trainees that they are slow. Katsuki tries to justify himself with the excuse that his power takes longer to activate in the winter. While the Sidekickers deal with the villain, Endeavor blasts off again, with the students following suit.
  </p>
  <p key="7281412e-2b61-480f-834d-885d1afd5885">
   Endeavor instructs them that, although sometimes they can receive help from others, as he received it from Hawks in his fight against the Nomu, a Hero have to learn to do everything on his own. Then he says to Katsuki that working as a hero, excuses like his previous one don’t matter when he shows to late, because he fails to save people. He accentuates this point after saving some people from being run over by a truck. While Izuku helps out the civilians, Endeavor gives Shoto and Katsuki the same assignment, to learn how to store up and condense their powers, to be able to release it at maximum impact until they can do it without thinking.

When Izuku asks about parallel processing, Endeavor talks about how everyone uses parallel processing subconsciously, using the example of a driver who through practice was able to do everything without thinking. He tells him that first he needs to learn how to do two things at once without thinking, and once he succeeds, to throw in another thing.
  </p>
  <p key="4c7e7acf-4c47-4498-91b9-8a933553f133">
   Endeavor concludes telling them that in the U.A. it’s where they acquired knowledge, but it will be during his Work-Studies with him where those lessons will really take root in them, stating that they can practice and fail as much as they want, as it won’t have any effect on his work.

   Throughout the week, the students try to capture a villain before Endeavor, but even so the Pro Hero always manages to get there first. Despite this, the three of them have high spirits and are sure that they will eventually surpass him. After returning from a patrol, Endeavor returns to his office, and gets a call from his daughter Fuyumi who, knowing that Shoto and two of his classmates are working with him, she's invites them all for a big dinner.
  </p>
  <p key="d6733621-e402-429e-8ddf-3b53fbd036e9">
   Endeavor proceeds to reflect on everything that’s happened regarding his family. He recalls his recurring dream in which he sees his wife and children happily sitting around the dinner table, but he is not with them. He has another internal monologue that he only approaches his family as a hero, not as a father. He thinks about pushing Shoto away from his siblings, pushing his wife to her breaking point, resulting in the accident and Shoto’s complete disdain for him. And yet his daughter Fuyumi, wishing he could make amends for his mistakes. Endeavor thanks his daughter for all the support she has given him.
  </p>
  <p key="cb6dd211-f5f2-4923-992d-e270c6871744">
   He thinks back to a moment sometime previously when he first heard from Fuyumi about Shoto visiting Rei in the hospital. She tells him how they’ve started slowly talking and that on days when he’s busy, he’s gonna start writing letters to her. Fuyumi then says how she hopes that one day her whole family could be together again. He then remembers Natsuo’s hard hitting critiques, Shoto’s own current opinions, and All Might’s advice on knowing what reason he has to be strong. He then receives an emergency aid from the Flaming Sidekickers, and heads out.

  <p key="125721ec-f3b1-446c-9517-d25caca3e311">
   The three spend the day patrolling the city and solving any cases they come across, with Endeavor still accomplishing the tasks first at every moment, all the while continuing to giving them advice on how to improve. As the sun sets, Endeavor thinks back on Fuyumi words, and brings Shoto, Izuku, and Katsuki over to his house for dinner per his daughter's suggestion, to Katsuki’s annoyance.
  </p>
  <p key="635e6b7f-c11e-497f-97fa-abaf8bcd7653">
   Fuyumi welcomes everyone, and informs that Natsu is there too. Dinner starts off well, with everyone enjoying the food, but then family tensions begin to show. Fuyumi reveals that Natsuo also did some cooking as well, though Natsuo states that since he over-seasoned the food, Endeavor made him stop. Endeavor apologizes for not knowing prior and wants to try some of his cooking, but Natsuo gets up and leaves, still unable to sit near his father.
  </p>
  <p key="0b50ee35-4714-4357-beb1-fa3e3bf65d6d">
   After dinner, Endeavor is in charge of washing the dinnerware while Izuku and Katsuki help with the plates. Meanwhile, Shoto and Fuyumi discuss the complicated relationship with their father, with Shoto admitting that he cannot forgive him for what he did to him and his mother. Izuku and Katsuki break into their conversation, and as they collect the remaining dishes, Izuku tells Shoto that he thinks she is preparing to forgive him. He tells her that it's okay not to be able to forgive him if he wants to, but since he knows that Shoto is a kind person, he is waiting for the right moment. Both Natsuo and Endeavor overhear this discussion.

   Enji walks into another room, to put a plate of food on the Butsudan Buddist altar in their home and puts his hands together in prayer. He once again monologues what he can do for them at this stage and having the same dream. He looks at a picture of his eldest son, Toya, and wishes he was here.

   Ending yells to Endeavor brings up under the most extreme circumstances, a hero will never kill someone. Ending, however, cites how Endeavor killed Hood and compares himself to said Nomu after the life he's led, so Endeavor doesn't have to worry about killing another "puppet". After Ending is caught off-guard by Shoto and the others, he takes the moment to attack but halts after seeing Natsuo held in the middle, not wanting to endanger him, and allowing the three students to press forward.

   Once the civilians are safe and Ending is defeated by Shoto, Endeavor embraces Natsuo (who was saved by Katsuki, that is also hugged much to his annoyance), grateful that his son's life is safe, he remarks internally how in one week, the three of them were able to successfully put what he had been teaching them into practice, as their growth was able to save a life.

   Holding his son and Katsuki, Endeavor asks Natsuo if he's hurt, while Natsuo only mentions how hot Endeavor's grasp is. Natsuo soon breaks free of Endeavor's grasp, as Endeavor reveals that he stopped to think in that moment fearing that if he were to save him, then Natsuo would never speak to him again. Natsuo hears his father confessed that he never meant to neglect him and Fuymi all those years, but acknowledged that he failed to take responsibility by running away from them. He also acknowledges that he feels it's his own fault for Toya's fate.

   After Natsuo tells him he doesn't care, for he heard everything from Toya growing up and declares he will never forgive Endeavor because he doesn't see himself as kind as Shoto or Fuyumi. Endeavor states he still came out for Fuyumi and Rei's sakes and that he was trying to respect the feelings of his sister who is trying so hard to fix the family that Endeavor broke, signifying that Endeavor sees Natsuo as kind enough. Endeavor then states that it's okay if Natsuo doesn’t forgive him because he's not looking for it, he just wants to atone for his mistakes.

   After Natsuo becomes teary-eyed, Natsuo tells him that Fuyumi had been so happy lately, but every time he looks at him, he thinks of everything in the past. He questions why he has to be the only one to try and proactively change and what exactly will Endeavor do to atone. Before Endeavor can respond, Ending speaks up, wailing that his 'arrogant, ferocious flame' is sizzling out.

   During the Work-Studies, the
   World Heroes Association
   contacts the Endeavor Agency for help on an overseas mission, but first, they must check if Izuku, Shoto, and Katsuki are qualified to participate in it. For this reason, Endeavor takes his trainees to a facility to test them: they must land an attack on him within a time limit of three minutes, those who do not succeed will stay at his home.

Izuku, Shoto, and Katsuki try again and this time, after better rethinking their strategy, they manage to hit Endeavor before the timer runs out. Endeavor tells them they pass, and the WH associates lead them to a room where they can design special stealth suits for the mission.

   When everything is ready, they start the storming of the base. The Humarise members in the building try to protect it, but are easily blasted away by Endeavor, who asks
   Clair Voyance
   for intel on the bomb's location. Yet despite an exhaustive search, none of Endeavor's forces are able to find any trace of Flect Turn or the bombs. The results were the same in the rest of the raids across the world so the WHA Director orders all the task forces to remain on alert in the countries that were assigned to them. Otheon's team leaves to a hotel in the capital that they use as a temporary base.
  </p>
  <p key="99bb1df6-0707-42b0-94e5-c7fccb27f1aa">
   Being the lowest ranking members within the team, Izuku, Katsuki, and Shoto are sent on errands for the heroes. As they're returning from one of them, they spot a jewelry robbery in progress and intervene to arrest the criminals.

   Shoto and Katsuki return to the hotel and explain what happened to Endeavor, who berates them both for acting on their own to stop a petty heist when they are on a mission, and orders them to let local heroes deal with minor crimes, with Katsuki sarcastically responding that Endeavor never taught them how to ignore threats. He then asks about Izuku, which Shoto replies that he went after a third person suspected of helping the jewelry villains, but they haven't been able to contact him, further enraging Endeavor.

   Right on cue, Izuku phones them to tell them that he and the thief had been attacked by a villain and the Otheon police for unknown reasons. As Endeavor, Shoto, and Katsuki listen to Izuku's story, an exasperated Clair Voyance interrupts them to show them the current television news that's being reported: Izuku has been accused of a mass murder of twelve people, resulting in putting him on the Otheon most wanted list. Endeavor, like the rest of the Otheon team, is shocked by these accusations, and Shoto tells Izuku to stay hidden while they try to figure out what's going on.
  </p>
  <p key="2b2f1005-9b53-48d2-bbfe-4a7a3390d646">
   Endeavor immediately goes to the Otheon Police Headquarters to demand explanations from the commissioner general, requiring him to show him the evidence that has made him accuse Izuku of being a mass-murderer. The commissioner refuses, arguing that Izuku's case is still pending, so he can't talk about the investigation, especially with a foreign hero like him. Endeavor leaves frustrated by the refusal, unaware that the commissioner general is a follower of Humarise, with the cult using this as an excuse to track down Izuku who had inadvertently gotten ahold of a briefcase containing Humarise secrets.

  <p key="08dcbba2-7ebf-4afb-ad6e-9e73737bf69a">
   Meanwhile at the hotel, Shoto manages to deduce more or less what is happening thanks to a series of clues, and after receiving an encrypted message from Izuku indicating where he is going, he takes Katsuki with him to go to the place, asking Clair to report to his father of everything he has discovered.
  </p>
  <p key="733afc08-acfd-46ea-ab0a-7dea2ee4e44e">
   Days later, Humarise hijacks all telecommunication and announces globally that they have placed the Trigger Bombs in twenty-five cities around the world, and that they will explode in less than two hours. To further attract the greatest number of heroes to the prepared trap, they indicate in which cities are found, Otheon being one of them. Endeavor's entire team immediately heads off to search for the bombs and help the terrified civilians, with Endeavor himself wondering about his son's whereabouts.
  </p>
  <p key="7ded0fda-9fb0-46b8-a8cf-01daf4866d86">
   During the search, he receives a message from the WHA headquarters informing him that his trainees have found a way to prevent the detonations and that they are heading to the secret base of Humarise to defuse the bombs. Burnin suggests that they should go support them, but Endeavor tells her they don't have time and have to stay behind to deal with the bomb, putting his trust in his trainees.

   A pitched battle soon breaks out between the heroes and Humarise. After much effort, Endeavor manages to reach the Trigger Bomb, but since there is little time left for it to explode and release its lethal contents, he grabs the weapon and uses his Hellflame Quirk to propel himself skyward, trying to get as high as possible.

Enji profusely apologizes once again, realizing that the regrets and guilt he feels right now are too late to matter. As his heart is about to shatter, he's shocked by the sudden arrival of his wife, Rei, who asserts that the rest of the family has been riddled with those same guilt and regrets for much longer than he has, and that she has come to discuss about their eldest son, Toya.

He expresses his regrets about not having given it all up on that day, but the guilt of having indirectly killed Toya made him decide to focus entirely on Shoto's training at the expense of everything else, namely his wife's sanity and his family bonds.

   Enji then learned the truth about One For All from All Might around the same time as Hawks and Best Jeanist. Three days later, they left the hospital and made a public announcement together. He apologetically confirmed Dabi's claims and accusations towards him, and confessed everything about his family's past, shocking and disgusting the general public. At one point, a woman from the audience spoke up to express her anger about her mother getting injured during Gigantomachia's rampage, the heroes seemingly glossing over the damage done over the past week, and their apparent lack of guilt.

He then implored the audience and the entire population to direct all their criticisms and doubts not at the heroes who will be putting their lives on the line, but at him alone, and to watch only him. Eventually, the journalists asked him about the nature of "One For All", to which he replied that he didn't know anything in order to protect Deku and All Might.

   In order to track down Tomura, All For One, and the remnants of the League of Villains, Endeavor, Hawks, and Best Jeanist come up with the plan to team up with Deku and All Might, using the former to act as bait to lure out the villains. While Deku looks for more Tartarus escapees, Endeavor goes with Hawks and Best Jeanist to cover more ground and deal with rampant criminals.

  <p key="fe685d67-2f97-4b65-95af-76cfb7e565ce">
   While searching for any clues to the whereabouts of All For One or Tomura, Endeavor finds himself under fire by some low-tier villains, with one of them using a very powerful nail gun support item, which he deduces came from

   He meets back up with Best Jeanist and Hawks where he confirms the convicts weren't sent by All For One. The three are then confronted by a mob of protestors, calling the three of them 'hero scum' and demanding they get out of their faces. Several of them blame them for the current state society is in for letting Tomura get away and releasing the prisoners. They also reveal they know Tomura is looking for someone else, meaning the heroes are still keeping secrets from them, as well as asking Endeavor if he has seen the grieving relatives of the people Dabi killed on TV.
  </p>
  <p key="e3095d95-3cc3-436e-b4e8-fd462a687c8b">
   Endeavor talks with Jeanist and Hawks about the current situation with Deku and All Might, and how he doesn't want Deku to receive more pressure than he already has, admitting how they are using him as bait to lure out the villains even though he asked for it, but are having trouble since they have gone underground.
  </p>
  <p key="0bbeb545-67fa-4ba0-ac3f-69b66e9fea9f">
   The Heroes proceed to discuss what the villains' have planned next, assuming the Tartarus escapees had received some orders from All For One, and therefore it is only logical that they are using the greater confusion and chaos to lay low while pursuing One For All. The three deduce that because All Might damaged All For One to the point he needs life-support to live, Endeavor confirms what Izuku said is true: All For One's top priority is controlling Tomura's body, turning Tomura into his successor would make for a new body for him, which is why he is prioritizing this task.

   , Endeavor arrives with the heroes to infiltrate the base, but finds it empty, only finding a hologram message from All For One sarcastically telling Deku that he took a thorny path of heroism because the more he fights the more his soul will wear down, and reveals that while in prison, he never stopped thinking about him, no longer having any interest in All Might. He gleefully tells him that it is "his turn” as the mansion explodes.
  </p>
  <p key="10409930-df39-41fc-aad4-dc024f23b705">
   However, the heroes managed to survive, and they reconvene in a warehouse discussing their current fighting strength. Edgeshot brings up the idea of all of them banding together the other heroes and share One For All’s secret so they can create a larger network of investigations.

   adds that following this incident with Lady Nagant, the brunt of investigating the League is falling all on Deku, and with the police dealing with their own problems and there being zero witnesses regarding the League, they should gather as many allies as they can while they still can.
  </p>
  <p key="2fadedbb-fe7b-4aba-bfcb-6a2445fb6209">
   Endeavor, however, reminds Mt. Lady that
   Death Arms
   retired two days ago because despite keeping up the fight, he had gotten nothing but criticism and doubt, and even though there are people who believed in him. Endeavor also adds that the retired heroes are leaking information regarding One For All, and the public are getting close to uncovering the truth about Deku. Endeavor says that if the public finds out about One For All’s nature, Deku will be caught in a cycle of negativity.
  </p>
  <p key="63ebf76c-a45e-4d66-9394-1cf2ec04a2b2">
   Mt. Lady says that she wonders why All For One hasn’t revealed One For All himself to the public, which Endeavor responds that if he did that, they would do everything they can to keep Deku hidden, so that is the reason why he hasn’t done that. However, he admits they don’t have any clues unless they and Deku move, and all of them come to face the reality that there aren’t enough police forces and heroes to handle it all. Endeavor’s phone rings, and he sees a text from Shoto asking him to pick up. He remembers Shoto telling him to let them work together to stop Dabi and he silently apologizes, saying that he needs to wait a while longer.
  </p>
  <p key="6266eb31-b273-4514-865c-58fc774467ef">
   The heroes then learn from All Might that Deku has abandoned him to go and fight the villains all on his own, leaving them to feel most distraught. However, unbeknownst to him, Shoto and the rest of Class 1-A were getting very impatient with his lack of response, so push forward with a plan to make use of Endeavor's U.A. alumni status to lure him over to the school so they can confront him personally.

Nezu informs Endeavor that he heard what they had to say and decided there was room for discussion since he is constantly getting updates himself. Shoto asks Endeavor why he has been ignoring him and if he forgot the promise they made to stop Toya together. Endeavor responds that it was Shoto's willingness that saved him, but Shoto retorts he doesn’t feel the same way without actually doing anything and asks what makes Izuku an exception.
  </p>
  <p key="a8143ecd-cff8-4a0b-a3be-5c1a1f1b82b4">
   Shoto demands to know if Endeavor is letting Izuku and All Might work together. When he says nothing, Katsuki’s suspicions are confirmed, but while he says it may have been the right call, he knows nothing about Izuku. Katsuki states that Izuku has always been crazy for never taking himself into account and insisting he is fine, citing it as the same way All Might became the Symbol of Peace. He tells Endeavor that he can't let the two of them be together, with Endeavor thinking back to when they learned that Izuku had brushed off All Might and how they don't know how else to support him from the sidelines.
  </p>
  <p key="c4f3d603-7d60-43d5-b6e2-e9693546dc9c">
   Convinced of their resolve, Endeavor decides to hand the students his GPS satellite phone that can pinpoint Izuku’s location. Many of them want to help him even though their relationship has been so far school-based and declares that as Class 1-A, they will follow Izuku wherever he goes, and no matter how much responsibility that comes with One For All, they consider him their friend, and they won’t let him walk such a troublesome path all by himself.

   Endeavor reveals that the outside world is in chaos right now but Nezu reassures them that they are ready. He says that he agreed to let him team up with the top three since he didn’t want to return to U.A. and that the villains were targeting him. But he reveals that he can return to school, since the minute they sent out the acceptance notifications, they all became students they will protect. Endeavor asks about the civilians' safety and Nezu tells Endeavor that the designated evacuation areas weren’t only chosen based on area, and that the school has reinforced their security "U.A.

   A few days after Class 1-A confronted Endeavor, he contacts Deku and informs him that the dates for when overseas heroes will arrive will be announced soon, which means they will have more manpower to help with the investigation. He tries to convince Deku to rest, as he knows how much he has been pushing himself, however, he replies that he can still move and he doesn't want to give the villains time to prepare. By then, Deku was already physically and mentally exhausted to the point where he is too weak after being confronted by one of All For One's villains;

   As Endeavor sees Deku stuck in Shoto's ice, Red Riot reflects that while there isn't much he can do right now with how much he's moving around, there's still so much he wants to say to him, a sentiment shared by Can’t Stop Twinkling and Invisible Girl, who run to check on the civilians. Endeavor tells Hawks that as of now, he shouldn't interfere.

  <p key="9c010a13-d348-497b-a89e-1773aebd0bd7">
   Once Deku collapses from the shock and exhaustion, he returns to the heavily fortified U.A. High where Class 1-A is confronted by angry protesting civilians, who don't want Izuku to be there as they suspect he is the one Tomura is looking for, thus putting everyone in danger.

   At that moment, Ochaco takes a megaphone to address everyone.
   Everyone listens to her speech, appealing to everyone to understand Izuku and let him rest at U.A., reminding them that Izuku has been fighting all by himself for their sake, and now he, as well as the remaining heroes that are still fighting to protect them, needs their support. It works, as the people calm down and allow Izuku to go in.

   lets them in, saying that everything is fine for now. Endeavor was convinced that all they ended up doing was pushing the burden onto Izuku and didn't make any progress, but Hawks says they did take a step forward. Just like how One For All is a power that links together people's hearts, so too is everyone connected here at U.A.: All Might through Izuku, Izuku to his classmates, Ochaco connecting Izuku to everyone, and with everyone thinking about each other, this can lead to the bright future where everyone will have time to laugh.

   As Class 1-A helps with the civilians and Izuku is escorted inside, Shoto turns to his father and tells him they’re doing it together, thinking back to Toya's face, which he agrees.
