   Forty-two students qualified for the Cavalry Battle after completing the Obstacle Race. Midnight explains that students must form teams of a maximum of four people: one rider and at least one horse.
  </p>
  <p key="e1c373ba-9ad8-4878-a280-233f66222fbf">
   Each student is given a point value and a team's value depending on where their members finished in preliminaries. The forty-second place finish is worth five points, with five points added to the point value with each cascading place. The first place finisher, however, is worth ten million points.
  </p>
  <p key="f284a0f8-db28-4494-aecc-1b6abcf294ca">
   Individual point values are added together to reach each team's total. These point values are displayed via headbands. The goal of the game is to steal headbands in order to raise the team's score. Contestants are not allowed to make each other fall on purpose. Even if a team loses their headband or falls down, they can compete until the thirty-minute time limit is up.

   The students are given fifteen minutes to form their teams. Many students in Class 1-A try to join up with Katsuki because he came in third in the first event and has two hundred points. Katsuki ends up teaming up with Eijiro, Hanta, and Mina. Minoru convinces Mezo and Tsuyu to join his team. All the while, everyone avoids Izuku because his point value is too high.
  </p>
  <p key="0e834d6a-fc06-4605-bcbf-b7b38d4c8f05">
   Ochaco decides to form a team with Izuku because she believes it's best to team up with friends. They try to recruit Tenya, but he refuses and joins Shoto's team in hopes of defeating Izuku. Denki and Momo join Shoto's team as well. Shoto explains their roles to his team. Denki is to use his electricity to attack other teams, Momo needs to keep their team's defenses high while insulating them, and Tenya commands the team's mobility. Tenya asks if Shoto will attack with ice and fire and Shoto refutes, explaining he never uses his flames to fight.

   Mei Hatsume introduces herself to Izuku and asks to join his team. She wants to use Izuku's fame to her advantage and get her support gadgets attention from the viewers. With Ochaco and Mei onboard, Izuku's team is nearing completion. Almost everyone else has joined a team at this point. Despite this, Izuku finds the missing piece for his team by recruiting Fumikage. Before time runs out, Neito makes a speech to his team about usurping Class 1-A and stealing the spotlight from them during this event.

   The final countdown concludes and Midnight announces the beginning of the game. All the teams rush Team Midoriya at once. Izuku boldly proclaims that his team will run away, but then suddenly Juzo uses his Quirk to soften the ground and force Team Midoriya to sink into it. Team Midoriya escapes by using Mei's jetpack. Kyoka attacks them with her earphone jack and Fumikage blocks it using Dark Shadow. Ochaco's Quirk gives Team Midoriya increased mobility since she's floating everything other than herself and Mei's equipment.
  </p>
  <p key="e47681b7-f416-4687-9c05-5611bfed9894">
   Team Hagakure quickly loses their points when Neito swipes their headband in the chaos. A free for all ensues while Team Mineta and Team Tetsutetsu try to corner Team Midoriya. Ochaco attempts to flee, but one of her hover boots is caught on Minoru's sticky spheres. Minoru and Tsuyu reveal themselves, hiding on Mezo's back.
  </p>
  <p key="1f8dd761-1239-47cb-a1ba-d82c676aa825">
   Team Mineta attacks using their Quirks and Izuku is forced to frantically dodge. He activates the jetpack to free Ochaco, breaking one of the hover boots in the process. Katsuki uses explosions to fly and attack Izuku while in midair. Fumikage is able to block Katsuki's explosion and Hanta uses his tape to reel in Katsuki before he touches the ground.
  </p>
  <p key="c8392da1-0858-47a4-b5c0-48aebf7888d4">
   Seven minutes in, Team Tetsutetsu, Team Monoma, and Team Kendo from Class 1-B control the second through fourth place spots. Every other team, save for Team Midoriya, Team Rin, and Team Todoroki, have lost all their points. Even Team Bakugo falls victim to Neito and Katsuki loses his headband. Neito taunts Team Bakugo and explains most of Class 1-B purposely placed low in the preliminaries in order to observe their Class 1-A rivals. At the halfway point of the game, Team Todoroki confronts Team Midoriya.
  </p>
  <p key="3bbc509f-10d5-4a10-8b2d-a99a637324f4">
   Ibara steals Team Mineta's points covertly by using her quirk. This prompts Mezo to go into attack mode and rush the two teams. Other teams also attack at the same time. They are all ultimately defeated when Denki electrifies them and Shoto follows up by freezing them in place before stealing their points.
  </p>
  <p key="fff5718f-c5c1-4ba9-80b3-b0db4e1f121d">
   Fumikage is able to defend against Team Todoroki's attack, but the shock causes their jetpack to malfunction.
