All Might notes that his title, the Symbol of Peace, serves to inspire people and Heroes to play their roles so that more people can be saved. Izuku’s mother arrives to pick Izuku up, Izuku comforts his crying mother, telling her that everything is fine. After Izuku and his mother leave, Naomasa theorizes that Tomura will probably target other students and decides that Hero schools must exercise more caution and become more proactive in implementing counter measures against villains. Naomasa advises All Might that leaving U.A. is also an option, but All Might decides against it. Naomasa concludes their conversation by saying that they will capture

The females excitedly introduce themselves as the professional Hero Team, The Pussycats. The brown-haired female explains to Class 1-A that they will be staying at the base of a mountain which is a part of their domain; they have three hours to reach the base of the mountain using their Quirks as they please and those who don’t arrive there by 12:30 pm won’t be served lunch. Soon, Class 1-A realizes that they have already arrived at their destination and their training camp has already begun with the Pussycats being their supervisors. Some of Class 1-A try to leave, but

   The black haired female notes that the training camp he has organized has been well thought out. Shota attributes it to the fact that the increased number of villains has forced the first years to take the accelerated year course (usually reserved for second years) so that they have the skills and knowledge to fend for themselves. Shota lets the Pussycats handle the beginning portion of Class 1-A’s training camp and leaves. The Pussycats decide to head back to the mountain base, however, the small boy is unenthusiastic.

Class 1-A arrive at the facility, battered and tired. It is now 5:20 pm in the evening. Pixie-Bob admits that she thought they would take longer to get to the facility. She praises Class 1-A for figuring out her Earth Beasts quickly and easily. Pixie-Bob then commends Izuku, Tenya, Shoto, and Katsuki for taking quick action against one of her Earth Beasts and concludes that they have experienced action against villains.

Izuku introduces himself to Kota. Suddenly, Kota punches Izuku in his crotch and begins walking away. Tenya goes to check on Izuku and admonishes Kota for his actions. However, Kota harshly replies that he doesn’t want to be with people who want to become corny Heroes. After Kota walks away, Shota instructs Class 1-A to fetch their luggage from the bus and put in their rooms. After doing so, he tells them to go to the dining hall for dinner and afterwards, take a bath and relax. Shota tells Class 1-A that their training begins tomorrow morning.

   Izuku brings the unconscious Kota to the cabin’s office who has passed out from the fear of falling. In the office, Mandalay thanks Izuku for being there to help him. Izuku notes that Kota doesn’t like the concept of heroes and explains that he along with many others grew up in an environment where they wanted to become heroes, Izuku is surprised that Kota has a jaded view on heroes. Mandalay explains that there are people in the world who don’t like Heroes and if Kota had a normal upbringing, then he would have grown up to idolize heroes as well. Pixie-Bob arrives and tells Izuku that Kota's parents were once heroes who lost their lives on the job. Pixie-bob explains that two years ago, Kota's parents, Water Hose, sacrificed themselves to save civilians from a villain and as a result, they were hailed as true heroes. However, Kota was devastated by the deaths of his parents and believed they had abandoned him to focus on their jobs instead, which caused Kota to begin resenting heroes and villains. After his parents' deaths, Kota went to live with the Pussycats, only going there because he didn't have anywhere else to go. Upon hearing Kota’s backstory, Izuku is reminded of his encounter with Tomura and his similar resentments towards Heroes; Izuku begins to understand that not all people have the same opinion.

Shota greets his students and tells them that they will undergo reinforcement training and explains that the training camp’s purpose is to strengthen their Quirks which will allow Class 1-A to obtain their temporary licenses. Shota tells Katsuki to perform the pitch from the Quirk Apprehension Test. Katsuki throws his pitch; however, Katsuki’s pitch records at 709.6 m, which is a minor increase from his last pitch. Some of Class 1-A are surprised with the lack of difference with Katsuki's new pitch as they were expecting it to be immensely higher. Shota explains that Class 1-A has gained much experience and definitely have grown, but the growth has only been emotionally and technical. Shota tells Class 1-A that it is now time to focus on physical growth; he notes they have now realized from Katsuki’s new pitch that their Quirks have improved only a little. Shota declares that from today onward, they will be focusing on upgrading their Quirks.

Moonfish continues breaking through Shoto’s ice defenses with his teeth enlarging Quirk while also using his teeth to maneuver himself around.

Out of nowhere, a giant shadow claw is about to attack Izuku; Izuku tries to defend himself, but his adrenaline begins wearing off and starts to feel great pain which stops him from moving. However, Izuku is saved by Mezo. Mezo decides to carry Izuku on his back after seeing his grievous injuries. Mezo explains to Izuku that he and Fumikage were ambushed by Moonfish. He covered for Fumikage and as a result, he lost one of his tentacles. Consequently, the ambush caused Fumikage to lose control of his Quirk that he was desperately trying to keep under control, Dark Shadow.

Shoto tries his best to keep Moonfish at bay by blocking his path with ice.

When Mezo and Izuku arrive at Katsuki and Shoto's location, Mezo asks one of them to make light. Before he can explain further, Moonfish senses Mezo and Izuku’s presence and sends one of his teeth to attack them.

   A few moments earlier before the Bakugo Escort Squad was formed, Tsuyu and Ochaco are fighting Himiko Toga who managed to slightly wound Ochaco’s arm. Himiko notes that her Quirk requires her to make big wounds in order to suck her targets’ blood. However, thanks to her machine, her Quirk’s weakness is compensated by the machine’s ability to drain blood from tiny wounds. Himiko begins to attack, to which Tsuyu responds by flinging Ochaco away with her tongue. Tsuyu tells Ochaco to run back to the facility; Himiko strikes Tsuyu's tongue with her knife and holds her against a tree. Ochaco runs back to Tsuyu and dodges Himiko's attack.

Shoto surmises that the villain sneaked up behind them and kidnapped Katsuki and Fumikage. Mr. Compress explains that his mission was to capture only Katsuki, but after seeing Fumikage overpower and defeat Moonfish so easily, he decided to kidnap Fumikage as well because of his powerful Quirk and notes that he will prove to be useful. Shoto hands Kosei to Ochaco. After doing so, Shoto uses his Giant Ice Wall attack in an attempt to immobilize Mr. Compress.
