   Later on, she finds Izuku training and tells him his new

   Shortly before the festival begins, Mei finally cleans and kempt herself. She presents her robot suit to several company representatives and, when the festival ends, she finally goes to sleep.

   After the fallout of the War and the downfall of hero society, Izuku, accompanied by Tenya, reunites with Mei to request a new costume upgrade, only to land in another deja vu moment where an explosion occurred right before he can answer the door and Mei lands on top of him.

  <p key="171d64e8-0546-42af-b6f7-f2c97bed6959">
   Mei asks Izuku and Tenya what they need from her, with Izuku lamenting with embarrassment how his

   . Mei is confused why they don’t just take them to the item agency, and Tenya responds that with recent disruption to the agencies, they have to rely on the support course. Mei’s increasingly nonchalant reactions cause Izuku to realize that Mei has no idea what is going on outside.
  </p>
  <p key="de0f48c9-b4a2-428a-98ba-16b9b0b40f71">
   Power Loader emerges from the explosions, once again berating Mei. Izuku hands Mei his

   , asking if she can fix it for him, but she immediately refuses due to the extensive damaged it has, so she’d have to create a new one, and they don’t have enough resources required for the compression mechanism. Tenya then asks for repairs for his armor, but she shuts him down due to not having a spec sheet.
  </p>
  <p key="89e97c8d-15e8-415d-8e69-e4f4aad2bfe0">
   Tenya is surprised that Mei would turn down the offer due to how much she loves making things, as Izuku looks on to see her currently working on the evacuation shelter blocks. Power Loader tells them that Mei was brought on to help strengthen the barrier, and she’s been busy creating new mechanisms in case of mass evacuation. Power Loader compliments her inventive mind, and she responds with how she always needs to try think up new “babies” to improve themselves.

  <p key="a9c104ab-fa4d-476f-b160-44cdbc660cbd">
   Izuku compliments Mei on how focused and busy she is with her inventions that she had no idea how the outside world is, but Mei responds calling him dense, saying that even she is aware of the trouble

   are facing now. And while they aren't fighters, they’re also doing everything they can to protect people; inventing stuff being how the support course does heroics.

  <p key="516d4f12-1a7b-4118-af6d-bcd9ccf9efeb">
   Before Izuku can react, Mei throws a pair of
   Air Force Gloves
   attached to new make-shift Gauntlets right at his face, saying that she couldn’t make an exact copy but it’s the best she can do, surprising Izuku that she did that all with just her left hand. She proceeds to throw a new piece of armor for Tenya right at his face too, exasperating the support students that she did it all so fast. She concludes saying for them to tell the rest of the hero students that they’ll all win this.
