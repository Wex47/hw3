He tells them that Teruo had been arrested twice for being an "Instant Villain", however he had undergone a drastic change between his first and second arrests in that his physical form had completely changed. In addition, the police had found several other villains with similar alterations that had concentrations of Trigger present in them which was several grades higher than the lethal dose of the drug. This had led the Police Force to suspect that someone had purposefully altered their bodies to withstand higher doses of Trigger.

   Naomasa tells them that he believes that the Villain Factory, responsible for the distribution of Trigger, is also administering to others and altering them to be able to withstand greater amounts of the drug. Shota says that the organization must have some greater goal in mind because by themselves their "Instant Villains" and "Next-Level Villains" could not do much and were more like disposable pawns.
