   In the past, when society was going through a though crisis, when Meta Abilities were feared and their users hated, an unknown woman gave birth to Chikara Yotsubashi, a boy with a meta ability. By having a super power, Chikara was marginalized and despised. His mother spoke out against this discrimination by claiming that his power was simply one of his "Quirks". She pleaded for a world where people with Quirks have the same rights and considerations as everyone else. Unfortunately, no one listened to her and she ended up being murdered by an anti-meta group. Her death and her ideals influenced the mindset of her son Chikara.

  <p key="03e14d44-ff0d-4c03-a2ce-ec653617401b">
   With the proliferation of the Quirks, the government began to regulate their use. In order to achieve it, they co-opted the words of the woman when they brought order back to the world, and the Quirks were accepted. Therefore, the woman became known as "

   Chikara was against this control system. He claimed that the government seized and misrepresented his mother's words to restrict the use of Quirks,
   believing that free use of Quirks is a basic human right. To fight for that ideal, he unified the liberationist to form the Meta Liberation Army and took on the name Destro - the one who would destroy the status quo.

  <p key="d8ebb47c-ea52-46b3-9487-dd169b6c6bb6">
   While the government trudged ahead with legislation, Destro and his followers opposed the powers that be and vied for supremacy prompting a struggle for several years until the militia group was ultimately defeated. Following their defeat, the group seemingly disbanded and the Meta Liberation Army's grand commander, Destro, was incarcerated along with several of its members. After an unknown period of time, Destro took his own life during imprisonment.

    The Meta Liberation Army is based on the real-life Tatenokai group originally led by Yukio Mishima (aka Kimitake Hiraoka). They created the Mishima Incident in 1970 where they tried to take over a military outpost in Japan, but failed with Mishima committing suicide and the rest of the group getting arrested or slinking into the background. There have been rumblings in recent years of the group returning in some capacity but hasn't materialized as the last major person of the failed Incident has retired peacefully to become a person of religion.

    They are also based on the Marvel comics organization The Brotherhood of Mutants as both organizations want the liberation of super-powered humans and the usage of unregulated superpowers.

    The Meta Liberation Army uses retro phrases when referring to Quirks, as seen when they refer to their own powers as "Superpower" or "Meta-Ability", the old phrases used in retro comics in the real world when reading comics.
