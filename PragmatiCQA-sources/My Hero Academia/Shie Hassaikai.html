   His generation fell from prominence during the rise of

  </p>
  <p key="65d63136-f0b5-450e-91a7-165185309e79">
   Kai grew up feeling he needed to restore the Yakuza to their former glory because he owes the boss a great debt. He also strongly believed that Quirks were a plague on the world and people infected with "Hero Syndrome" ruined the Boss's life. Kai got more heavily involved in dark dealings despite the Boss's misgivings.
  </p>
  <p key="01d01786-4184-4039-a8b6-1f2139b8f94e">
   Eventually, the Boss introduced Kai to his daughter's child. A little girl was left to him after her

   . He developed a plan to use Eri's Quirk to develop a

  <p key="b9b1541e-6598-49be-8b8f-6b0fd843a669">
   Kai would use his own

    Quirk
   </a>
   to overhaul Eri's body and experiment with her DNA and infuse her blood into a weapon that erased Quirks. Kai believed he could cull the Heroes by developing "Quirk-Killer Bullets" and distributing throughout Japan. This would bring guns back to prominence as a legitimate threat to people and then the Yakuza could sell a cure too after the plan gets in motion. By controlling an entirely new market for Quirks, Kai could reinstate the Yakuza as the biggest superpower in Japan. He would achieve his goal of getting rid of Quirks and returning the world to the way it was before the Quirks changed everything.
  </p>
  <p key="206193fc-759d-41fa-b53f-9787e5b7e3cd">
   However, the Boss refused to consent to Kai's inhuman plan and worried about Kai's sociopathic mental state. He tried to get Kai to understand the Yakuza's code of ethics and told him to leave if he refused to embrace them. Disappointed but ever determined to achieve his goal and honor the Yakuza, Kai secretly put the boss into a comatose state. He took on the name Overhaul and became the young Yakuza boss of the Shie Hassaikai.

   , the only two people he grows to trust. He recruited anyone he deemed useful into the fold, even those who were considered trash, so long as they followed orders and use their Quirks for his ambitions. People followed him because he gave them a purpose. Kai believed himself to be enlightened and his pawns to be expendable bullets for his assault on society.
  </p>
  <p key="efa05a5f-8e3c-4b85-a63d-3d2b661b6f50">
   The gangsters who followed the Boss only followed Overhaul for him. They believed Kai was involved in his sickness and disliked how the organization and its members became associated with villains.
   The small Yakuza group became a dangerous villain organization created with the intention of destroying Quirks and returning the Yakuza to power. Following the fall of All For One, Overhaul deems it the perfect time to become the next king of darkness.

   The Yakuza are still a small organization on the brink of extinction and do not have ample resources for Overhaul to carry out his plan. The Eight Precepts need to collect funds for their operation. They commit a series of unresolved crimes where they escape with the stolen money, including one incident where Overhaul attacks

   A black communion between the Hassaikai and the League of Villains commences a few days later. Tomura meets with Kai after being lead through their underground base. Tomura sits down with his feet up and immediately announces that if the League should join forces with Yakuza, it will not be under the Hassaikai, instead, they will be equals.

  <p key="ef1819c4-363d-4feb-b891-a01bc029b5ff">
   Tomura's second condition is that Overhaul shares the details of his plan because the League won't be involved in worthless schemes. Tomura reaches into his jacket and insinuates he has an idea, but Chrono and Mimic threaten him. Tomura is mostly unaffected and demands compensation for the death of Magne. Overhaul calls them off and Tomura reveals the Quirk-Killer Bullet that was used on Mr. Compress and asks if the plan has anything to do with it.

   Despite their misgivings toward Overhaul, Twice and Himiko become temporary Yakuza. Overhaul apologizes for killing Magne and asks that the new recruit share their abilities upfront.

Chrono takes aim with a gun loaded with the finished product and threatens to erase Lemillion's Quirk for good. A large battle ensues and even while protecting Eri, Lemillion proves to a true hero. Lemillion is stronger than even Kai and bests both of them in battle.
  </p>
  <p key="0f149006-4ca2-4089-a67e-95be9b3080f5">
   Mirio tells Kai that he's lost, but Overhaul claims he left that name. Nemoto craws back to his master's side and Overhaul arms him with the Quirk-Killer Bullets. Desperate to defeat Lemillion, Kai orders Nemoto to shoot.
   Nemoto takes aim at Eri and Lemillion sacrifices his Quirk to protect her from the pain. Even so, Mirio Togata protects Eri from the villains for another third of the battle without his Quirk. Overhaul commends Mirio's incredible talent and prepares to kill him when suddenly Deku and the rest of Nighteye's Squad storm the battlefield.
  </p>
  <p key="3e53f9c9-a031-440f-b0e4-656aed2e5755">
   Deku and Eraser Head tag team Overhaul and beat him down. He becomes increasingly irritated by their interference and orders Chrono to wake up from Lemillion's assault. Chrono takes Eraser Head out of the battle and Overhaul's Quirk returns to him. Greatly aggravated, Overhaul disassembles Nemoto's body as well as his own. Refusing to allow the heroes to win, Overhaul sacrifices Nemoto and his own humanity to take on a powerful, monstrous new form.
  </p>
  <p key="057df09a-2b32-4da1-86f0-529197b7f6b5">
   Overhaul heals his wounds and admits he's never been pushed so far in battle. He reveals to everyone that Lemillion's lost his Quirk and then attacks. Nighteye engages the villain and orders Deku to take Mirio and Eri to safety. Sir Nighteye uses his Quirk to see a future where Overhaul wins and escapes. Pushed beyond his limit, Sir Nighteye succumbs to Overhaul's strength and is mortally wounded. Deku rejoins the battle and Overhaul argues that the Heroes will all die for opposing him but Deku claims he will change the future.
  </p>
  <p key="d1b00ba9-f98b-4c9b-9608-7197e29d59bc">
   Chrono captures Eraser Head and binds him using his Quirk. Deku and Overhaul engage in a fierce battle. In spite of pushing himself to the limit, Deku is nearly defeated by Overhaul's overwhelming new power. Overhaul uses Nemoto's Confession Quirk to lead Eri back to him. He claims Eri doesn't need to be saved and prepares to finish the Heroes off when suddenly Ryukyu Squad crashes through the roof with Rikiya in tow.
  </p>
  <p key="ad48e158-b90c-47f1-b52c-c0e1fc878980">
   Overhaul takes Eri and tries to escape through the new hole in the roof. However, Eri is inspired by Deku and Lemillion's bravery and decides to act so that she can save everyone. She uses her Rewind Quirk to separate Nemoto from Overhaul and jumps into Deku's arms.
   Overhaul desperately tries to get her back, but Deku accidentally launches himself outside the cave. Overhaul had been trying to avoid touching Eri because of her Quirk. Desperate, Overhaul tells Eri he belongs to her and decides to fuse with Rikiya this time.
  </p>
  <p key="b945664d-aecd-4671-9193-ae5d4f3c6482">
   Overhaul enters his final form and chases Deku to the surface. He tells Izuku that Eri's Quirk will rewind him into nothing if he continues to hold her. Overhaul claims Eri is cursed and he's the only one who can control her. Deku refuses and uses Eri's rewind to control his Quirk at 100% of its power.
  </p>
  <p key="ca0389ea-fc56-4212-b504-692feb6bd57b">
   Overhaul explains that Eri's power can destroy the current world and return it to the way it was. He believes that only he understands that she is the key to returning the world to order. Deku and Overhaul clash in the climactic final battle. With power equal to All Might's, Deku clearly outmatches Overhaul even in his final form. He proves way too fast to allow Overhaul to heal himself and the evil crime boss is finally defeated.
  </p>
  <p key="63e4a07d-214e-42cb-a184-542c14c37d85">
   Suneater and the Police rescue Eraser Head and arrest Chronostasis. Overhaul makes one last stand but Eri's power explodes and rewinds him to his regular form. Eraser Head stops Eri and the mission is finally complete. All eleven injured villains from the Hassaikai are arrested and transported toward a villain hospital via the highway. However, before they reach their destination, the convoy is attacked by the League of Villains.
  </p>
  <p key="b8da57c5-1030-46f4-aaa0-29546bed0d2f">
   Tomura and his gang dispatch the police and confront Overhaul. They steal the Quirk-Killer Bullets and cut both of Kai's hands-off as revenge for looking down on them and killing Magne. Tomura marches off with Kai's life's work as he watches helplessly while the Shie Hassaikai crumbles for good.

  <p key="423811db-7b12-4315-b60c-6796e7709e2c">
   The fall of the Yakuza has earned the Hassaikai a reputation for being a small-time gang. Their resources and wealth are very limited, forcing Overhaul to recruit any scum he can get his hands on. The gang's foundation is made from civilized thugs who are loyal to the original boss. These thugs are weaker than the average Pro Hero due to their less than impressive Quirks. The gang's arsenal includes handguns, knives, and katanas among other weapons, and were only used by Overhaul as cannon fodder.
  </p>
  <p key="b9737a46-34cb-4334-bf49-9da800b20578">
   Under Overhaul's leadership, the Hassaikai maintain their small-time status as a ruse by mostly operating under the radar and covering up their crimes, pretending to uphold traditional Yakuza values. Mimic directs the organization while Chrono acts as Overhaul's direct aid. Both of Overhaul's assistants possess unique Quirks, but it's their minds he makes the most use of.
  </p>
  <p key="152baab9-fcbd-4390-ac0d-d0b5611e3656">
   Overhaul recruits muscle from the underworld of society, regardless of their past. He established Eight Expendable Bullets that he would use to ensure the security of his master plan. Each of the Eight Bullets possesses considerable abilities and are very capable fighters. They are strategically paired into teams to maximize their strengths. For example, Kendo Rappa's Strongarm makes him a perfect spear in battle while Kenji Tengai's Quirk serves as the perfect shield. With the Eight Bullets and Overhaul's two assistants, the Hassaikai became a very strong villain group, unlike the Yakuza thugs that were forced to work under them.
  </p>
  <p key="3d4d62c7-6abb-414a-9911-aa7fe0ec1660">
   The Young Boss of the Shie Hassaikai is one of the fiercest villains in the series. Overhaul prefers to allow his underlings to do the dirty work, but his impressive physical tools, analytical skills, and deadly Quirk make him more than a match for most heroes.
