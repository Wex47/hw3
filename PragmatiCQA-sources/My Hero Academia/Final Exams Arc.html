While All Might is distracted by the light, Katsuki grabs Izuku and throws Izuku towards the escape gate with an Explosion. To prevent Izuku from escaping, All Might uses New Hampshire and blasts himself into Izuku which crushes Izuku due to All Might's great weight and sends him tumbling down. Katsuki chases after All Might, Katsuki tells All Might that the Grenadier Bracers were to help him use his maximum Explosions without risk and admits that he was a fool for thinking that he could win without taking risks. Katsuki uses a huge Explosion against All Might (similar to the Explosion in the Sports Festival) and tells Izuku to escape; Izuku struggles to get up. Katsuki decides to sacrifice himself to hold off All Might so that Izuku has time to escape; Katsuki uses another huge Explosion against All Might. However, although the great Explosions have distracted All Might, the Symbol of Peace is still unscathed.

Not allowing Izuku to make an escape, All Might prepares to attack Izuku but Katsuki intercepts All Might's attempt. Izuku successfully activates One For All: Full Cowl and begins his escape while All Might smashes Katsuki into the ground. Izuku sees that Katsuki is in trouble. Despite being greatly injured, Katsuki yells at Izuku to escape and bites All Might's hand. All Might ignores Katsuki's desperate attempt and tells Izuku that he won't allow him to escape.

While rushing to help, Izuku remembers All Might's words; that when times are scary and uncertain, you face it all with a smile. Izuku smiles and punches All Might in the face. While All Might is suffering from slight recoil, Izuku grabs Katsuki who has fallen unconscious. Izuku rushes towards the escape gate with Katsuki in tow. All Might shrugs off Izuku's punch and watches him escape. All Might understands by now that Izuku is the type of person to save somebody; All Might notes that whenever Izuku tries to save somebody, there's never a wall in his way.

   Recovery Girl comments on Fumikage and notes that he has brittle defense and struggles against numerable opponents which causes him to become pressurized; she also analyzes that Tsuyu is a person who is usually calm while under pressure in combat and can help Fumikage deal with his pressure, allowing Fumikage to help her with his full strength, to which Izuku agrees with Recovery Girl's assessment, having been reminded of Tsuyu's calm and level headed attitude at the

   The fight between Fumikage and Tsuyu against Ectoplasm continues with Fumikage being overwhelmed by the sheer number of Ectoplasm's clones. Suddenly, one of Ectoplasm's clones appear before Fumikage. However, Tsuyu smacks it away with her tongue. Fumikage and Tsuyu manage to make it past Ectoplasm's clones and reach the vicinity of the escape gate where the real Ectoplasm is waiting. Ectoplasm compliments the duo for outrunning his clones but asks them if they can deal with his next attack. Ectoplasm uses Forced Internment Giant Bites, a move that creates a giant clone of himself. Fumikage and Tsuyu are unable to escape and the giant clone munches them which traps Fumikage and Tsuyu in its ectoplasm. Unable to do anything, Fumikage orders Dark Shadow to escape as it is now the only way they can obtain victory. Dark Shadow proceeds to the escape gate but Ectoplasm kicks Dark Shadow away. Tsuyu comes up with a plan and decides to regurgitate something, telling Fumikage to not look so that Ectoplasm does not notice them. Dark Shadow struggles against Ectoplasm. Fumikage recalls Dark Shadow to collect the item Tsuyu has; Dark Shadow collects the item and goes back to fight Ectoplasm. Dark Shadow attacks Ectoplasm with its claw while Ectoplasm blocks it with his kick. However, Ectoplasm's leg is chained by a handcuff. Tsuyu explains that she regurgitated a handcuff since her stomach can store and eject objects and gave it to Dark Shadow so that it could handcuff Ectoplasm with its claw. As a result of Ectoplasm being handcuffed by Fumikage and Tsuyu's last desperate team strategy, they pass the practical exam.

Present Mic uses his loud voice again, Kyoka notes that they cannot get any closer as long as Present Mic is using his Quirk. Kyoka sees an ant and comes up with an idea, she asks Koji if he can control bugs but his terrified reaction indicates that he doesn't like bugs. Present Mic uses his loud voice one again, Kyoka tries to counteract with her Earphone Jacks but the sound of her heartbeat doesn't do anything against Present Mic. Present Mic continues using his loud voice against Kyoka and Koji who are unable to handle it. Out of options, Kyoka asks Koji if he can control insects to which he approves. Kyoka uses her

Kyoka tells Koji that she understands his phobia but using the insects to attack Present Mic is the only plan she can think of because their opponent is too strong. Kyoka encourages Koji to follow through with her plan. After seeing Kyoka's bleeding ears, Koji is ashamed that he is running away from this fight and realizes that he can only continue being at U.A. by overcoming his fear. Koji musters up the courage and commands the insects to attack. At the escape gate, Present Mic sees that time is nearly up. Suddenly, dozens of insects crawl on Present Mic who realizes that the insects traveled to him by moving underground: a place where a sound is ineffective. Present Mic is paralyzed by fear, allowing Koji to run through the escape gate while carrying an injured Kyoka with him, thus they pass the practical test.

    Katsuki and Izuku are partnered together for the first time when fighting All Might. However, Katsuki refuses to work together with him due to his own arrogant belief he can win all by himself. However, All Might points out that his rage and hatred of Izuku is out of jealousy due to his vast growth rate. After Izuku punches him in the face when Katsuki stated he would rather lose than accept his help while pointing out how foolish his beliefs are of refusing help, Katsuki reluctantly accepts help. From then onward, Katsuki begins to accept the concept of teamwork.
