   Back at Nabu Island, at the end of the day, the class is exhausted from all the hard work and deeds that they've done. Hanta wonders if the small acts are considered to be hero work, so Tenya assures that every deed that happens on the island count as hero work. Momo reminds everyone that they may have their provisional licenses, but they are still students, so they will have to put in the hard work to make sure that the island residents can count on them. Minoru points out to the class that the only one who hasn't done the work since they arrived on the island was Katsuki, who refuses to do small deeds unless there is a villain involved.

After eating their dinner, Denki, Hanta, and several other students come and tell Eijiro to join them at the onsen bath and assign Katsuki to be on night patrol. He complains, but the guys remind him that he didn't do any hero work all day long. Katsuki can't argue that and goes out to patrol the grounds.

Coming back from his patrol, Katsuki finds Izuku training and tells him to hurry and master his Quirk. They have an exchange over who will be the No. 1 Hero before it's interrupted by Katsuma.

   The next morning, after recovering from his illness, Nine, Slice, and Chimera arrive at the entrance to the island after Slice scouted them on the ruins of the ancient castle. The villains make their way to Mount Shiroyama, determined to take Katsuma no matter the cost.

   With the villains approaching the ruins, the heroes begin their assault on the villains with a pre-emptive strike. Yuga attacks first using his signature move, "
   Supernova
   " to fire a massive laser bombardment at the villains. While Nine blocks the attack with his Air Wall Quirk, Slice, and Chimera break away from the blast, unaware that they are falling right into their trap. Momo reveals two massive cannons she created last night with the last sources of her

   With the villains separated, Hanta and Ochaco commence their assault on Nine. Hanta uses his

    Zero Gravity

   . Nine deflects all of their attacks using his Air Wall Quirk for defense and his Bullet Laser Quirk for an offense. Ochaco continues to use her Quirk to make more floating boulders for Hanta to throw at Nine, but the villain is still not stopping, so Hanta, Minoru, and Ochaco retreat to a trap they prepared and caused a massive rock slide with Minoru using his Super Move
   Super Grape Rush
   to make the rocks stick together even harder to bury the villain. However, Nine is able to break free easily, knocking Minoru out of the battle. Momo and Yuga intervene and engage Nine, but the villain defeats both of them.

   Izuku and Katsuki engages the villain, but they aren't strong enough to take down the villain as Nine uses his Air Wall and Bullet Laser Quirks to defend and attack at the same time. Hanta attempts to help out, but he is defeated after Nine uses his Bullet Laser Quirk to blast him. Ochaco tries to make Nine floats but she gets knocked out by his Hydra Quirk. Izuku and Katsuki fire back against the Hydra Quirk with a combination of Delaware Air Force and AP Shot, but the Quirk is too much and takes them both down.

   As the villain's about to defeat Izuku and Katsuki, Nine has reached his limit and starts to reel in pain from his illness. Izuku and Katsuki seize the opportunity, but Nine activates his life-support to take a heavy dose of empowering drug and goes beyond his limit, summoning a massive lightning strike that seemingly vaporized Izuku and Katsuki.

   Quirk. Despite using the darkness to his advantage, Fumikage proves to be unmatched for Slice and her swift combat agility. Fumikage makes an opening for Mina to use her signature move,
   Acid Shot
   to destroy much of Slice's hair. Fumikage attacks with Dark Shadow, but Slice retaliates by using her Quirk to fire multiple barrages of sharp needles at Dark Shadow and Mina. Mina attempts to dodge all of her attacks, but she gets wounded in the process.

  <p key="da90a715-6430-46ee-bf1b-0ca7fff570a2">
   Enraged, Fumikage goes berserk and his Dark Shadow Quirk intensifies to become massively monstrous and viciously attacks Slice. The villain attempts to shoot her hair needles at the ceiling, but she is defeated by Fumikage after Dark Shadow grabbed her. However, the cavern collapsed on top of them. The sunlight from the sky nullifies Dark Shadow as Fumikage uses his body to shield the wounded Mina while the cavern buries all of them under piles of boulders.

   At the waterfall, with Chimera alone, Tenya, Tsuyu, Eijiro, and Shoto attacks the villain. Tsuyu drags Chimera into the water before Shoto freezes it, but it isn’t enough to stop the villain.

   At the same time, in the mainland, Hawks questions Katsuma and Mahoro's father who regained consciousness and retells everything that happened to him, and how the villain, Nine, stole his Quirk. Hawks receives a call from the Public Safety Commission who informs him that a fisherman found a drone that contains a message saying that villains have attacked Nabu Island. Realizing that Class 1-A is at Nabu Island and engaging Nine and the villains alone, Hawks flies over to the island as fast as he can while contacting U.A High to send in reinforcements.

   Nine is just shocked by what he just witnessed, but he still refuses to give up on fulfilling his dreams, and engages Izuku and Katsuki in a intense combat, releasing all his Quirks at their maximum power. After a lengthy fight, Izuku and Katsuki finally manage to defeat Nine once and for all using the Explosion Quirk combined with St. Louis Smash at 100%, effectively ending the threat, but the ember left by One For All sparks out, leaving Izuku permanently Quirkless once again. Both heroes pass out from their injuries and exhaustion. As Izuku loses consciousness, he thanks One For All for everything as its last embers are extinguished inside him.

Toshinori forgives Izuku, but is left surprised when he sees One For All still retained inside of Izuku. At first, he theorized that Katsuki must've lost consciousness before the transfer could be completed, but on second thought theorized that One For All must've kept itself inside of Izuku for his willingness to risk himself to protect the innocent even if it means losing One For All.
