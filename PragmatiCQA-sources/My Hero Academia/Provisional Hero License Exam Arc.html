   also knew about their plan to rescue Katsuki. Shota explains that their actions have been covered up but tells them that if All Might did not retire, with the exception of Katsuki, Toru, and Kyoka, he would have expelled them all as punishment. Shota advises to Shoto, Eijiro, Izuku, Momo, and Tenya to go through the proper procedures next time which will also restore the trust between them.
  </p>
  <p key="6f25fc4e-07bf-490d-9024-8473d6b581ff">
   The atmosphere of Class 1-A has become gloomy. Katsuki sees the gloomy atmosphere and lights up the mood by taking

   , which makes Denki derby as a result, causing Kyoka and the rest of the class to laugh. Katsuki then gives Eijiro money to pay him back for buying the night vision scope for their rescue operation. Eijiro apologizes to Class 1-A for his actions and will apologize to them by treating them to a barbecue.

   Now that Class 1-A's mood has become better, Shota shows them their new dormitory. Heights Alliance has one dorm per class and Shota takes them to the Class 1-A dormitory. Shota explains that their dorm is separated by gender: the right wing for females and left wing for males. However, the first floor is common space and contains the dining area, baths, and laundry facilities. Class 1-A take a look at their new dorm and become excited about living here.
  </p>
  <p key="2c1fe688-dae0-48b0-bca8-2ac9fd8e238c">
   Shota then explains that their bedrooms are on floors two, three, four and five; every student gets their own private bedroom, with each room having an AC unit, bathroom, refrigerator and closet. Shota gives Class 1-A a map of their room allocations and says that their luggage has already been sent into their allocated rooms. Shota ends his explanation by telling Class 1-A to spend the rest of the day unpacking and organizing their rooms. Tomorrow, he will explain the operations of their new life style.

   Class 1-A arranges their luggage in their respective bedrooms. Later that night, the boys of Class 1-A are in the common space on the first floor. The girls of Class 1-A show up and Mina suggests a room showcasing competition. On the second floor, Izuku's room is filled with All Might memorabilia,

   Denki, Mashirao, Fumikage, Yuga, and Minoru are unsatisfied with only having the male rooms evaluated, with Minoru saying that they must also evaluate the rooms of the females to be fair in order to determine a winner. Mina agrees to have the female rooms evaluated. Thus, the contest to decide the room with the "best taste" has now begun.

   Class 1-A continues the "room with the best taste" contest with the winner receiving the Room King Award and thus title of "Room King". On the fourth floor, Eijiro mentions that Katsuki did not want to participate, so Class 1-A decides to check Eijiro's room and the other rooms. Eijiro's room is filled with manly items and

   's room has a minimalist theme. On the fifth floor, Hanta's room is surprisingly stylish. Next, Shoto's room is Japanese styled with tatami flooring. The girls are impressed with Toru commenting that Shoto will grow up to be a big-shot while Denki and Minoru are surprised, impressed yet envious that Shoto did all the remodeling by himself. The next room is

Tsuyu says that she told Class 1-A at the hospital that trying to save Katsuki out of selfishness would be no different than what a villain would do. Tsuyu admits that those words were severe, and that after they actually went to save Katsuki, she was shocked and began to regret what she had said. Tsuyu became frustrated at her cowardly behavior and felt immense guilt for trying to stop them from rescuing Katsuki.

   is designed to test the students' aptitudes such as information gathering, judgement, mobility, leadership, and communication in various types of trouble. However, the attitude that is most prevalent is fighting ability. Cementoss comments that bringing stability to a situation is a mark of a hero's true fighting ability.

  <p key="223c959f-aaf0-44a8-a0e2-0af0507e9ba5">

   as a move worthy of being called a special move since being able to move at blistering speeds within a short space of time gives him an upper hand. Class 1-A begin to understand that the purpose of special moves is to give them the upper hand in battle. Midnight gives another example of a special move;

The other students of Class 1-A continue their training and thinking about their special moves while Izuku is still puzzled on what to do next. All Might approaches him and gives Izuku advice, he is still trying to imitate him, which confuses Izuku. Before Izuku can question further, All Might goes to help Eijiro. All Might is teaching Izuku to think independently.

   Seeing as he is unable to think of any special moves, Izuku decides that his best course of action is to upgrade his costume and goes to the first floor of the U.A. building to seek expertise from someone in the development studio. Outside the development studio's door, Izuku thinks that upgrading his hero costume to reinforce his arms' movements so that he can raise the upper limit of

Tenya has decided to mitigate the drawbacks of his Recipro Burst move and is going to ask the development studio to upgrade his Hero Costume's radiator.

   Mei apologizes for the explosion she caused; she asks the Class 1-A trio for their names since she forgot them. Izuku, Ochaco, and Tenya remind Mei of their names. Izuku asks for a costume upgrade, which catches Mei's attention. Power Loader reminds Mei that he is fine with her working in the Development Studio but must not cause chaos, otherwise, he will ban her. Power Loader turns his attention to Izuku, Ochaco, and Tenya and invites them into the Development Studio.

  <p key="30b1bf8a-bb5a-45a5-bf38-33dc42b30580">
   Inside the Development Studio, Izuku, Ochaco, and Tenya are amazed at all the machinery in it. Power Loader explains to the trio about hero costume upgrades. After looking at their respective costume instructions, he will be able to tinker with their costumes. If it is small improvements and fixes, all he needs to do is inform the design office about the changes, but if it is big improvements, he must prepare a formal written application to the design office to request approval. After the newly upgraded costume gets inspected and approved, it goes back to them. Power Loader tells the trio that the design office he is partnered with is one of the best, so any costume upgrades can be done within a mere three days.

  <p key="5d85d19b-7a6b-4871-a656-3daf492f8541">
   Izuku asks Power Loader if there is something that can reduce the stress on his arm ligaments. Power Loader replies that minor tinkering to his hero costume will make it possible. Suddenly, Mei inspects his body, much to Izuku's discomfort and Ochaco's displeasure, and forces him to wear a powered exoskeleton she made. The suit malfunctions and starts to swivel uncontrollably, nearly twisting Izuku in half. As he recovers from the painful experience, Izuku once again asks for simple arm support.

   Wanting to avoid Mei, Tenya whispers to Power Loader about wanting something to help cool down his leg thrusters, but Mei manages to overhear him regardless and proceeds to add to his Tenya's costume Super Cooler Electric Boosters. However, the boosters are for the arms and not the legs, much to Tenya's frustration. Mei already knows that

  <p key="8b80f56d-e262-4b48-bfbd-0b0560be9809">
   Power Loader scolds Mei for messing around. However, Power Loader advises Izuku, Ochaco, and Tenya to invest in their relationship with her because once they become Pro Heroes, she will be taking care of their Hero Costume needs. Power Loader points to a mountain of trash in the Development Studio, he tells them that the trash is actually support items Mei has created since she started at U.A., even creating support items during the school holidays. Despite her self-centered attitude, Power Loader compliments Mei for her talent at inventing as well as her courage to come up with new ideas and attempt to make them real even if they fail.

   Izuku suddenly realizes that his way of thinking has been wrong; people who invent are not bound by conventional thinking and in order to improve himself, he must think out of the box like Mei. While Mei helps out Ochaco, Izuku asks Tenya to help him with something.

   hides alone in a steel labyrinth-like area of the arena. He hears the announcer reveal that over fifty students have passed, forcing Shoto to act. Shoto is immediately targeted by a group of students from
   Seijin
   , clad in a ninja garb. They ambush Shoto and he blocks their projectiles with a wall of ice before freezing them all in place.

  <p key="c6b3d844-7d7b-481c-b1db-e3df9547cc37">
   The student in red throws a bolt at Shoto and uses his Quirk to greatly increase its size. Shoto blocks with a shield but the ninja breaks through it by attacking with more weapons. Shoto tries to melt another projectile thrown at him but he's forced to dodge. The ninja reveals the weapons are made up of tungsten, a material resistant to super high temperatures. He tells Shoto he's overconfident for acting on his own.

  <p key="59574389-6512-4257-af7c-b867b3a869ea">
   The red-clad leader calls Shoto overconfident for working alone. Shoto responds with a fire attack and two students negate his attack with their water-based Quirks. Then he defends with his ice but the students counter by throwing large items to break it. Their strategy is to negate both of Shoto's elements with their various Quirks.

  <p key="b2f70091-abec-431c-b62b-a16644a03204">
   Shoto manages to get away after the engagement fills the area with steam. He realizes the labyrinth-like area their fighting in must have real features built into it. The Seijin students are drawn to a decoy flame and then Shoto uses his ice to break a tank above them. By using his fire on it as well, Shoto manages to create an explosion that incapacitates his rivals.

   Victorious, Shoto freezes them and then tags their weak points to pass the first test.
   Yokumiru then announces that the 54th examinee has passed; the 54th examinee to pass is Shoto Todoroki. Shoto managed to hit his targets by simultaneously using his fire and ice. Shoto comments that his simultaneous usage of his fire and ice together are sluggish and he still needs practice. The lights on Shoto's targets light up and once of them tell Shoto to proceed to the waiting room.
  </p>
  <p key="43da877f-6666-47da-8993-1b5b456565a0">
   Inside the waiting room, Shoto sees that quite a few examinees have passed like him already. While looking for a place to sit down, Shoto spots Inasa who is having a conversation with another examinee about Stamp Man. Shoto goes to sit down on a chair and ponders that he should have met Inasa when they were taking the Entrance Exam since he was also recommended. During the conversation, Inasa sees Shoto and suddenly stops talking, silently glancing at Shoto. Inasa turns back and continues his conversation with the examinee.

   Momo can't move as well from overusing her Quirk and Saiko tries to tag her targets to make her fail. Momo counters by handcuffing their arms together. She buys enough time for Mezo to break down the door. Tsuyu rushes in and uses her tongue to restrain Saiko's other arm. Saiko is shocked that Momo's allies came to her rescue because they could've passed without her. Kyoka, Tsuyu, and Mezo explain that they would never leave their friend behind and Momo follows up by saying that's just how Class 1-A is. Impressed by the U.A. students, Saiko admits defeat.

   Izuku's criticism stops Shoto and Inasa's stops their arguing. Shoto suddenly remembers that Inasa is the teenager he encountered in U.A.'s Entrance Exam; the reason he didn't recognize Inasa is because at that time he was only seeing his hatred of his father, Endeavor. After the Sports Festival, Shoto decided to forget about his for his father after reconciling with his mother. Seeing that forgetting his past isn't helping since it comes back one way or another, Shoto decides that he needs to do something else to confront his past.

All For One comments that he had the power to embrace and embody the ideals of evil and as long as he could live on eternally through these ideals then no effort is too great for him.

   All Might asks if All For One wanted to live forever being utterly evil, then why does he need a successor. All For One finds All Might's question funny. All For One answers that All Might took everything away from him, most importantly his body, it is only thanks to the tube he is wearing that he is able to carry on living. The nemesis of evil's ideals had become limited no thanks to All Might. All For One comments that when there is an end, they entrust, everything that has been made by humans such as houses and food to be entrusted to other humans. All For One states that he is simply trying to do what everyone else has been doing which is why he has been grooming Tomura Shigaraki to become his successor.

All For One had already known that the world would be shaken by All Might's retirement and wonders about the state of affairs going on in the world. The security inform All Might that All For One is completely cut off from information about the outside world and tell All Might not to give All For One any information happening right now. All For One is disappointed that All Might cannot tell him any information that is going on in the world.

   All For One decides to make a hypothesis; due to the anxiety caused by All Might's retirement and the Heroes' new leader Endeavor, the media is appealing to the entirety of the Hero society. On the other spectrum, sensing the growing insecurity in the world, the outcasts who don't support Heroes will rise up and take action because they think they will able to shape the way society behaves and organize amongst themselves. All For One assumes that Tomura will continue concealing himself for a while so that he can continue to build the League of Villains and expand their influence.

   All For One assumes that there is dissension among villains as well. All For One thinks that if the illustration is actually unfolding in that manner, then that is how he assumed the world would turn out to be. All of this change is due to All Might's retirement and the lie of his appearance. All For One believes that All Might will spend the rest of his life powerless and stricken by his inability to save anyone, sitting idly unable to stop the villains that are rising up. All For One asks All Might how does it fell being absolutely powerless.

   All Might gets up while security tell All Might to step back. All Might tells All For One not to presume everything. All Might understands that he and his successor, Izuku, are to be killed by Tomura. All Might declares that he will not die by Tomura's hands and he will never allow the future that All For One envisions to happen. All For One wonders if All Might came here to tell him that. The security informs All Might that his time is up. All Might begins walking away, telling him that he will smash the dark future his nemesis envisions as many times as he needs to and All For One can rot in his lowly prison cell for all eternity. The prison cell begins closing as All For One mulls over spending the rest of his life in prison.

   Nezu apologizes for bringing down the mood but the Heroes are dealing with the situation to the best of their abilities and he would like nothing more than to develop them into individuals who will take over their efforts. Nezu ends his speech by saying that whether they are in the Departments of Heroics, Support, and General Education and even the staff of U.A, they must not forget that they are the successors to the Hero society.
