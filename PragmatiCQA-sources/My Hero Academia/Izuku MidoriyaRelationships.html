   and therefore cannot be a hero, she apologizes profusely as if it were her fault. It is hinted that she blames his sadness on herself and has gained weight as a result, but it is unknown if this is true.

   , and gets into his dream school, U.A. High School, she is happy for his newfound powers, but feels guilty about her former beliefs. Inko tries to make it up to him and show her support by creating a costume for Izuku, using the design she had seen him sketch. She brings up her past actions and apologizes for not believing that he could be a hero, reassuring Izuku that she will support him all the way on his path to accomplish his dream; Izuku is touched by this and thanks her.
  </p>
  <p key="1bc10d35-64cd-4b17-baa7-f5e48eba0d24">
   Despite these words of encouragement, it is evident that Inko becomes worried for Izuku when she sees the distressing amount of damage done to his body after he used his new Quirk. Indeed, after the ordeal at the

   </a>
   , Inko is completely against him resuming his studies at U.A. due to the staff's inability to properly protect her son. Izuku is shocked at this and cannot seem to say anything to shift mother's firm stance. Only after Izuku shows her Kota's letter, a sign that he is truly on the path to being a hero, does she change her mind about U.A.

   Ochaco is the first person that Izuku interacted with at U.A. High School. He saved her from being attacked by a giant robot and she returned the favor by ensuring he landed safely on the ground after jumping to her rescue. The two met again after becoming classmates and soon became close best friends; they get along very well and their discussions are always bright and friendly. A running gag is Izuku blushing and getting flustered whenever Ochaco happens to be too close to him, hinting that he might have a crush on her. Ochaco is the one who turned his once demeaning nickname "Deku" into a positive identity for him, saying it gave her a "never gives up" vibe. They share similar ways of quick thinking, tenacity, perseverance, and high spirit, which contributes to their friendship.

   They mutually respect each other, as Ochaco is inspired by Izuku, striving for his level of tenacity and perseverance. They are protective of one another, as Ochaco quickly called the police after she found Tomura threatening Izuku. Izuku thinks of her as a brave and resourceful person by herself and considers her very capable of devising strategic plans on her own. He even defends her from Katsuki when he thought she was incapable of fighting on her own and had help from Izuku.

   Over time, Ochaco has developed a crush on Izuku. And while not outright confirmed, it's hinted that Izuku reciprocates her feelings. For example, he felt immensely touched when Ochaco turned his nickname "Deku" into a positive identity for him, that inspired him to choose it as his official hero name. He also confidently defended Ochaco from Katsuki when the latter thought she fought him valiantly only because she had guidance from Izuku.

   While participating in a joint training exercise with 1-B, when Izuku was first manifesting Blackwhip, Ochaco was the first to realize he couldn't control it and came to his aid. After, she showed was concerned for his well-being. His reckless regard for himself had lead to her understanding heroes need protecting too, and she makes a vow to watch out for anybody who needs it as a hero who saves people to help them and not just for money. He would also inspire her to add hooks to her gauntlets for rescue a while later.

   Afterward, at Christmas, she and Izuku receive each other's Secret Santa gifts with ecstatic looks on their faces. Ochaco got Izuku a bag of Mochi Chips, and Izuku got her an All Might keychain. Ochaco has taken to carrying this keychain he gave her on her belt, causing Mina to tease her. But at that time, Ochaco smiled and responded in a slightly nervous way while putting the keychain away, indicating that she felt a little less embarrassed about her feelings for Izuku. After starting up work studies again, Class 1-A showed off their new moves to All Might. Ochaco and Izuku shared a touching moment where they thank each other for making one another stronger, fist-bumping.

   She later joins the rest of 1-A in tracking him down to bring him back to U.A. When it's Ochaco's turn to speak with him, she explains she and the others are more than willing to go after Izuku even though she understands he's only trying to keep them safe. Before Ochaco can finish her sentence, Izuku tries to run away. Ochaco gathered her classmates to launch Ida after Izuku to capture him, thinking to herself how she knows that she and everyone has something to say to him but they know their words alone won't have any effect. She acknowledges the class don't want to be protected by Izuku, or that they're rejecting Izuku's own beliefs and his actions. She and the others just want to be with him.

   When the class succeed in rescuing Izuku, they bring him back to school. Yet as he suspects, the civilians refuse to let him inside. They know he's the rumored boy Tomura was pursuing. After they were convinced U.A. would provide them sanctuary, they're scared about allowing in what they consider a “ticking time-bomb." Izuku is about to leave but Ochaco grabs his hand to stop him and tells him it's okay, as she is determined to not let him go.

   buys the heroes of Japan time to regroup and track down the villains with her sacrifice against Tomura and All For One. And then the reveal of Aoyama being a spy for All For One also puts a great strain on the class dynamic as they zero in on destroying the diabolical mastermind for good, making things far too busy as everybody prepares for a second war.

   Ultimately, it would take another week of waiting for Izuku to finally get the chance to speak to Ochaco personally at Class 1-A's new mobile stronghold, Troy. He meets her on the cliffs overlooking the damaged cityscape the day before the operation against All For One, thanking her profusely for what she did. This makes Ochaco embarrassed as he keeps showering her in compliments, and when she calls herself weird Izuku rambles about how pretty her hair looks making her further flustered. They then get to discussing Himiko, with Ochaco relating that she held complicated feelings toward the serial killer, but realized it wasn't fair to judge her too harshly since she knew nothing about her. She makes it clear she can never forgive her, but she's thinking about reaching out and attempting to save her all the same.

   Izuku is pleasantly surprised to hear this, as he himself holds similar feelings toward Tomura. He explains he felt the presence of a little boy inside him and wants to save him if possible. Ochaco chuckles and remarks "both of us are kind of weird." They spend some more time together in silence, surveying the damaged city as they wait out the final hours before their upcoming confrontation with All For One and the rest of the League, knowing it'll be the fight of their lives.

   In their first meeting, Tenya labeled Izuku's muttering about heroes as a distraction and thought he would be a hindrance to the school which earned Izuku bad attention from his peers.

   in the process.

   When they met again in class, Izuku first thought that Tenya was scary and that they wouldn't get along, but was surprised as the latter apologized for his previous treatment to him and even considered Izuku better than him in many ways after the entrance course, much to Izuku's shock. Izuku got to know Tenya better, where he found out that while the latter was serious he was also kind and they ended up becoming friends. Izuku and Tenya are usually friendly with each other. However, sometimes their friendship slightly falters such as when Izuku criticized Tenya for seeking revenge against Stain and Tenya punching Izuku in the face for acting recklessly by attempting to save Katsuki. Tenya has often compared Izuku to his brother, for whom he has great admiration for.

   Despite this, Izuku and Tenya's friendship has rebounded back many times despite these mishaps, mainly because they are only concerned for each other's well being. They are usually seen together having friendly discussions. Izuku resigned as Class President and named Tenya as his successor, knowing that he has better leadership qualities than him. After Tenya is defeated by Shoto, Izuku is saddened to see his friend lose. Since Izuku knows that Tenya has a grudge against Stain, he tries to save him from his death. While recuperating at

Tenya would say that Ingenium is the Hero who will grab the hand of a lost child and that giving help that’s not asked for, is what makes a true Hero, paralleling Izuku's words to Tenya that meddling where you don't need to is the essence of being a Hero. These words would cause Izuku to openly break into tears upon hearing those words.

   Shoto originally saw Izuku as his arch-rival, due to him having connections with All Might (a person with whom his father has a major rivalry with). Izuku, on the other hand, has always held great respect for Shoto, admitting that he is far stronger than him. Shoto confronts Izuku at the U.A. Sports Festival, asking if he is All Might's secret love child, but the latter denies this as Shoto decides to reveal his family history. After hearing Shoto's tragic backstory and seeing his sadness, Izuku starts to show sympathy for the pain he went through and resolves to help him overcome his dark past by getting him to use his power, telling Shoto that the power is his own and not his father‘s. Although Izuku loses to Shoto while trying to help him, Izuku's actions do have an impact as Shoto starts reacquainting himself with parts of his past he had forgotten and stops rejecting his power. Shoto also recognizes that Izuku knowingly insisted on helping him, despite knowing it would lead to Shoto's victory.

They work well together, going on to defeat the infamous hero killer. After the battle, Izuku and Shoto are on friendly terms with each other, with Izuku even laughing at Shoto's expense when he was worried that he was cursed to always hurt people's hands. They are good friends thereafter — Shoto, who was previously shown to have little interactions with his classmates, starts to hang around with Izuku and his friends more frequently, even joining their lunch table. Throughout the series, Izuku has had subtle parallels with Shoto's mother, Rei Todoroki. From giving Shoto eerily similar glances, Rei during her mental breakdown, and Izuku during his match with Shoto, to Shoto being openly vulnerable around both of them. Shoto has a deep love for his mother, and a deep friendship with Izuku as he was the one who inspired him to reach out to others.

Tensions grow when Natsuo refuses to accept the normalcy of seeing his father take on an attentive role, believing he still hasn't taken accountability. Izuku intervenes to help Shoto explain his feelings. He claims that he believes that Shoto is preparing himself to forgive his father, and that he's a "caring person". It's heavily implied that he assesses this through his internalized feelings towards Katsuki and their rough past. Natsuo confirms Izuku's way of describing Shoto, explaining that he couldn't do the same because he's not as caring as Shoto. Just before that, Izuku called Shoto by his hero name, which also is his given name "Shoto". Upon departing their internship, Shoto's sister, Fuyumi, shares Izuku's hand and thanks him for being Shoto's friend.

   Despite the short time they've known each other, Izuku and Melissa have become well-acquainted with each other. During their initial meeting, Izuku was flustered by Melissa by how close she was to his body when examining his scars and hero costume. Once Melissa started touring him around
   I-Expo
   , Izuku quickly bonded with her over their similar interests in heroes and support tech. Izuku even preferred Melissa to call him by his hero name instead of his first or last name. The two also share a goal in wanting to save people. Melissa also shared her past of being Quirkless, as Izuku related to her since they both overcame it in their own way.

Izuku realizes that Katsuma wants to be a hero, although Katsuma didn't considers his Quirk good for that.

   Izuku's relationship with Rody did not start out well, as the U.A. student pursued the street rat when he had ran off with a case of stolen jewellery following a robbery involving
   two
   villains
   . Izuku eventually caught up to Rody, though the latter managed to make Izuku back down by saying that he was a businessman while also bringing up that Izuku was doing hero work in Otheon without proper jurisdiction. After a short scuffle over the case, Izuku was shocked to find out that Rody's briefcase contained a number of books, notes and documents, with no stolen jewellery to be found. After this, Izuku profusely apologized to Rody for suspecting him, leaving Rody to anxiously walk away to try and recover the stolen goods, although Izuku notices his nervousness and follows him to inquire if he's okay. Once the Otheon Police arrive and corner Rody, Izuku tries to defend him only to save the young man when the police open fire on him. Later on, after escaping the police and a

   Even after Rody tried to abandon Deku and turn the briefcase over to Humarise (Izuku was woken up by Pino, representing Rody's reluctance to leave him behind), Izuku still saved him from

   and took an arrow to the chest protecting Rody. After escaping the villains, Rody expresses his surprise over how Izuku ran to protect him, despite being betrayed by him. Izuku responds by telling Rody that he can't help but save someone in trouble, regardless of who they are. Over time, Izuku and Rody bond closer as they travel to Otheon's neighboring country Klayd, with Rody even telling Izuku about his dream to be a pilot, his past and his little siblings,
   Roro
   and

Izuku was shocked and devastated to see Rody apparently betray him again by giving the key to Flect Turn, but then saw Pino confirm that his actions were a lie to get Flect to drop his guard. Together, Izuku and Rody managed to deactivate the Trigger Bombs and save the world. As they part ways, Rody tells Izuku that he's glad to be rid of him and not to come back to Otheon as he only causes trouble, but Izuku sees Pino crying over his departure confirming those words to be a lie, and the two embrace as they bid each other farewell.

   After finally committing to training them, Endeavor is surprisingly able to understand Izuku's mumbling about the nature of his Quirk and how he wants to control it, providing him with useful advice. He develops a newfound sense of empathy and understanding towards Izuku, recognizing his power as not only similar to All Might's, but also likening the danger the raw power has to his body to his families' Quirks, saying he's "just like us", though Izuku is unsure of what he means. His teachings and training are what eventually allow Izuku to have full control over Blackwhip.

As the fight goes on, Deku's hatred for Tomura continues to grow, and it only worsens when he sees the villain impale Gran Torino in the chest. After seeing this, Deku screams and grabs Tomura, declaring that he will never forgive the villain, bearing the same amount of hatred for Tomura as the latter would never forgive anyone like him because he is a hero.

   When conversing with the One For All vestiges, they all understand Izuku's hesitation, having sensed his emotions when he first noticed Tomura suffering. Regardless, Nana states that Tomura is likely beyond saving and urges him to find the resolve to kill him if necessary. In response, Izuku reflects on how he felt Tomura's emotions while inside the mental world, and he was able to see a little boy crying inside. Izuku notes that while Tomura did kill many people and hurt many friends, One For All was meant to save people, and ultimately, while he does consider the possibility that he will have to kill Tomura, Izuku still voices his desire to try and save Tomura first.
