   The villains demand to know who they're fighting, but the young man simply replies he's a hero from Japan. The villains attack with a missile barrage that the hero easily dismisses. More interested in escaping than fighting, the two criminals quickly flee the scene. The hero loses track of them after taking too long to boast.

David is speechless from the surprise and All Might is very happy to see his longtime friend. He introduces David to Izuku, but the nerdy student knows all about Professor David Shield. He's a noble peace prize winner, All Might's former sidekick, and the designer of all his hero costumes. David notices steam coming from All Might and asks everyone to give them some time alone. He asks Melissa to show Izuku around the expo.

   Izuku tells Melissa that he'll save David but she needs to be the one to save everyone else. Melissa flees and the Hacker tries to follow. Izuku refuses to allow him to pass, forcing him to come to blows with Wolfram. Together, Melissa and Izuku manage to save everyone by disabling the security system. All of the drones return to normal mode and I-Island is set free from the grasp of the villains. Wolfram prepares to escape with David on a helicopter and Izuku pursues them. Melissa calls All Might to update him on the stakes. He promises to rescue Izuku and David.

   David asks that the villains kill him but Wolfram has other plans in mind. Izuku catches up to them on the roof and Wolfram asks if he's come to rescue a criminal. Izuku rushes toward his foes and cries out that he's going to rescue the professor. Izuku manages to evade most of Wolfram's attacks as he shouts it's a hero's duty to rescue those in need. Wolfram turns his gun to David, forcing Izuku to stop, and then slams him with a metal pillar. He barrages Izuku with similar attacks and gets on the helicopter with David aboard.

   Izuku refuses to let the professor go and leaps high into the sky. He grabs on to the helicopter and tells the professor that Melissa is waiting for him. Wolfram tries to shoot Deku but the bullet is sent off course by a swift tackle from David. Deku crashes into the helipad below and laments letting the villains escape. All Might's voice reaches through the sky and reminds Deku to smile in situations like these. The Symbol of Peace leaps high above the helicopter and restores faith in everyone with his signature motto. "Everything is okay because

   All Might soars through the helicopter, rescuing David and sending the villains to their fiery demise all in one motion. David tries to apologize to All Might but Wolfram abruptly appears from the smoldering remains of the crashed helicopter. He attacks them both with a metal pillar and traps David in a metal casing. Wolfram is using David's Quirk Amplification Device to boost his Quirk exponentially. The No. 1 Hero tries to silence the villain but Wolfram proves far more powerful than before.

   Wolfram uses his enhanced powers to transform the tower's roof into a scrap metal hell. Wolfram nearly crushes All Might under the weight of a steel barrage. Shoto and Katsuki prove a hero is never alone and come to his rescue. The other students join the fray, with Tenya and Eijiro taking on the metal pillars as well. Motivated by his student's passion, All Might goes beyond his limits and uses his awesome power to break through Wolfram's iron defenses.

All For One gave Wolfram this power and information on All Might because he wanted to help twist All Might's best friend to the darkness. All Might's smile fades from the shock of finding out his arch-nemesis has orchestrated the incident. Wolfram crushes All Might under a torrent of scrap metal. Izuku's instincts kick in and he breaks the iron prison apart in time to save his mentor.

   All Might scolds Izuku for being reckless with his Quirk. Izuku argues that a hero must act when people are in trouble. All Might's smile returns and he thanks his young successor. He asks that Izuku aid him in this final battle. Izuku arms his Full Cowl and places his faith in Melissa's Full Gauntlet. Sensei and pupil race into the heat of battle, rushing pass an endless iron assault from their foe. Melissa watches as Izuku mirrors All Might's power and is moved to tears by their teamwork.

   Wolfram's last-ditch effort is forming his metal into a massive iron cube large enough to crush the tower. All Might and Deku go beyond their limits and break through the cube with a

   At last, the heroes are victorious and the scrap metal hell disintegrates into dust, along with the Quirk Amplification Device and the Full Gauntlet. As he regains consciousness, David sees the triumphant pose of Izuku, and sees a young All Might within him. Melissa checks on Izuku and All Might on David. David thanks All Might for saving him but All Might bestows the credit on their successors. They are the two heroes who saved the day. Reuniting, Melissa appreciates everything Izuku has done, while reminds her that her actions helped save everyone on this day, also apologizing for getting the Full Gauntlet destroyed.

   All Might tells David that Melissa explained the details of what happened. David admits that he was so afraid the Symbol of Peace would fade away and lead to the end of peace. David realizes now that he was just trying to hang on to the past, and knows that Izuku and Melissa will protect the future and ensure peace to everyone. All Might says Izuku isn't ready yet but he possesses the potential to be the greatest hero. David says he can feel the same light in Izuku that comes from All Might, the light of a hero.
