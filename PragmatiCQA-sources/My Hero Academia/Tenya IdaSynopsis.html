   Tenya is the only one among the viewing participants to notice that Izuku saved Ochaco.

He says to himself that he would have done the same if he hadn't been on the exam and that maybe it's part of the test.

Tenya tries to calm down and introduce himself properly, but Katsuki's only reply is that he'll simply crush him. Tenya is shocked that Katsuki would threaten his own classmate just as Izuku enters the class, surprised he is classmates with both Katsuki and Tenya. Seeing him, Tenya decides to re-introduce himself to Izuku instead. He apologizes for his previous treatment and commends him for seeing what he had not during the practical exam, that saving others was just as important as defeating the villains.

She calls Izuku "Deku," as Izuku tells them it's an insult Katsuki gave him as children, but changes his view on the name as Ochaco calls it cute, as Tenya is surprised at this change of mind.

   Tenya, Mashirao, and Power Loader arrive in an at a dirt field where their test exercise will take place. Power Loader explains the 30 minute test; Tenya and Mashirao must either handcuff him or one of them must escape the battlefield within 30 minutes in order to win and pass the test. The test begins.
  </p>
  <p key="66052705-cef0-4087-9260-45b6fd4605ba">
   Because Power Loader is constantly digging through the ground, Tenya and Mashirao can barely move because the ground collapses in front of them. Tenya decides their best course of action would be to escape. Mashirao gets on Tenya's back. Tenya activates Recipro Burst and outruns the traps. When the ground in front of him collapses, Tenya leaps over it.

   Tenya ran at a high speed to remind Denki and Minoru not to slack off, and see that some of his classmates, including Izuku and Ochaco, have come to I-Island as well. He explains that he was the only one from his family to be able to attend the expo. Izuku notices an explosion nearby, so the group heads over and finds a Villain Attack attraction, where Eijiro and Katsuki were participating in. Irritated by Izuku's presence, Katsuki blasts over in his direction and makes a scene, causing Tenya to reprimand him. Tenya and Ochaco praise Izuku's performance in the attraction, annoying Katsuki further.

   They devise a plan to disable the security system so that All Might can deal with the villains. They scale up over fifty floors until they stop at a closed shutter on the 80th floor. Minoru opens the door to the main floor, notifying their presence to the villains. Tenya and Shoto break through and create an opening to the plant factory just in time before the shutter doors close them off from both ends of the corridor. They hide after noticing the elevator coming up, and see two villains coming out to find the students. However, they instead find Katsuki and Eijiro, who got lost. The villains attack the two, but Shoto saves them with an ice wall. He creates an ice pillar to elevate his friends up to the top, where they find a small roof panel that leads to the maintenance room, and convince Minoru to help out. He succeeds, and the group advances past the one hundredth floor.

   , so they go with Plan B and disrupt their communication systems with smoke bombs made by Momo. Tenya and Izuku pushes back the robots and the group moves on. On the one hundred and thirty-eighth floor, the groups find security bots in the server room, and, because they cannot afford to damage the servers, Izuku, Melissa, and Ochaco continue ahead while the rest fight the bots.

   For some time, Tenya holds back the robots with his Recipro Turbo, but time runs out for him, Momo, and Minoru, so the robots restrain them. They are soon freed after Melissa disabled the security system. They run up and motivate All Might to free himself from Wolfram, and cheer as Izuku and All Might use a

   to defeat the villain. Tenya is later seen with the rest of Class 1-A after the expo opens.

   Ochaco suggests taking advantage of Endeavor's U.A. alumni status to confront him, which is backed up by Nezu. After learning the truth from him, Endeavor is convinced of Class 1-A's dedication to Izuku and Tenya declares that as Class 1-A, they will follow Izuku wherever he goes, and no matter how much responsibility that comes with One For All, they consider him their friend, and they won’t let him walk such a troublesome path all by himself.

   Nezu gives permission to allow the class to bring Izuku back home to safety, and Tenya leads Class 1-A to search for him across the country while apprehending any escapees from Tartarus and the other prisons. After a month since he first left, Tenya and Class 1-A arrived on the scene to defeat

   during his battle with Izuku. Izuku asks why they are all here and insists that he is okay and that they shouldn’t worry about him and leave, but they all refuse to leave him. When Izuku refuses to yield, he demands everyone to get out of his way, which means they might have to fight Izuku, with Tenya telling everyone else to stand strong.

   Class 1-A proceed to duel with Izuku as he attempts to escape them, while they try to restrain him so they can return him back to U.A. During this, Tenya thinks about how once Izuku sets his mind on something, he never stops.
   Eventually, Izuku finally tries to escape into the sky, so Class 1-A brings out their ultimate plan. Tenya is coated in Mina's Acidman, with the heavy-hitters, including Mezo, Rikido, Koji, and Fumikage, pushing him and Katsuki forward as Shoto blasts the two up the ice ramp with his

   . Ochaco tags Katsuki and the Acidman with her Quirk, and then Katsuki blasts Tenya even further into the air at blinding speeds using his Blasting Speed Turbo Cluster as the Acidman melts away.

  <p key="b566c980-3ad8-4c5c-9270-e3cb71902f7a">
   With sheer speed, Tenya successfully grabs ahold of Izuku's hand, completely shocking him, still insisting for him to let go. Tenya refuses, stating that he is a hero who will always take a lost child by the hand, and repeating Izuku's words when he saved him from Stain that "giving help that's not asked for is what makes a true hero."

  <p key="f6898824-6f92-4f62-a5a6-6f9acb9cb186">
   Ochaco releases her Zero Gravity, causing Tenya and Izuku to fall toward the city. He wonders how he's going to stick the landing, when he sees Eijiro who manages to catch the both of them. Tenya and the rest of Class 1-A listen to Katsuki apologizing to Izuku before he finally collapses from the shock and exhaustion. Once Izuku is secured, they escort him safely back to a heavily fortified U.A High where they are confronted by protesting civilians.
  </p>
  <p key="da60e73d-0461-4c27-92fd-b103b796a35b">
   The civilians are distressed because they are aware that Tomura is targeting Izuku and him being there at U.A. will put them in danger too. Everyone tries to reassure them but to no avail, until Ochaco floats her way up to the top of the building, shouting down to everyone and giving an impassioned speech to let Izuku stay.
   During the speech, Tenya and the class watch on in awe, with him telling Izuku that she is fighting for him and everyone's right to smile again, as he eventually tears up and breaks down in exhaustion.

   and a mutant woman rush up to comfort him, with Tenya holding Minoru back from doing so, telling him it's not their turn yet. With all this, the civilians agree to let Izuku stay, and Tenya and the rest of the class proceed to escort him inside.
   The boys immediately rush Izuku to the bath, stripping and washing him down before getting in themselves. Afterwards, Class 1-A is visited by All Might, where he and Izuku apologize and make up before he heads back out. With Izuku finally passing out and getting some rest, Class 1-A comes back together, as they declare they won’t just bring the world back to how it was, but to make it a better place than before, and do it all together.

   , thanks to her actions, the Quirk acted like a virus within his body, destroying several of his Quirks and delaying his procedure by about a week. All Might informs all this to the class, telling them that this is now their perfect time to prepare for the inevitable all-out war. The class reveals over the past month they had been training with the Wild, Wild Pussycats in order to keep up with Izuku in the incoming conflict, and are now about to head out to continue their training.

   The class train amongst themselves in the courtyard, where they discuss about their plans for the incoming conflict. Izuku says how they need to try and dictate how they enter the fight, and that he’s going tor rejoin the search soon, before being reprimanded by Tenya, reminding him that “we” will be rejoining the search. Izuku then asks if he can go for a quick stroll, which Tenya says is okay as relations between the Heroes, students, and the evacuees have grown warmer since Ochaco’s speech.
  </p>
  <p key="b9f96913-084f-4c96-b2f7-21917557a442">
   Shortly after this, Tenya and the rest of the class receive the devastating news that Izuku had just captured the Aoyama Family, learning that they have been spies for All For One, and Yuga was the traitor who isolated the class at the U.S.J. and revealed the location of their training camp. Restraining them in the AV room, he and the other class members refuse to back down from the news despite Nezu's request, all in stunned and tears of Yuga's betrayal. He listens to Yuga's desperation that drove him to despair, followed by Izuku's pleading to let Yuga still help them.
  </p>
  <p key="d144ac0d-a0d8-4d7f-8955-9ca2e3bcdf91">
   The rest of the class quickly realize that they could have Yuga help deceive All For One and "steer the villains" into the fight, and when questioned why they're so willing to trust him, Tenya simply responds that what happened is in the past, and with them being unable to realize how he's been feeling all this time, they carry some responsibility, so they must reach out to him as friends in order for them to become equals again.
  </p>
  <p key="938984f3-a5d1-4e54-adbd-d1f8a2f04fcb">
   Shota then appears on a tablet screen, taking full responsibility and reveals that he has an idea, which Class 1-A, the U.A. Staff, and Police Force hear while the Aoyama Family's ears have been covered. Naomasa then has the Aoyama Family escorted back to their HQ, telling everyone not to say a word to anyone else about the plan, while he and the rest of the class look on sullenly.

   Back at Heights Alliance, Class 1-A take a breather, before getting ready to gear back up, as everyone, with fire and rage in their eyes over the betrayal, prepare to bring All For One down once and for all. Tenya and Izuku head to the Development Studio in order to fix up their hero costumes, when Izuku is suddenly caught in a very familiar explosion blast, which Tenya sees as "deju vu", soon spotting Mei Hatsume emerging from the smoke, landing directly on top of Izuku.
  </p>
  <p key="723e8a93-6898-4c21-956b-a98382773f06">
   Mei asks Izuku and Tenya what they need from her, with Izuku lamenting how his Danger Sense didn’t activate. Tenya tells Mei they came looking for repairs for their Hero Costumes. Mei is confused why they don’t just take them to the item agency, and Tenya responds that with recent disruption to the agencies, they have to rely on the support course. Mei’s increasingly nonchalant reactions cause Izuku to realize that Mei has no idea what is going on outside.

  <p key="17a21566-d685-44e5-9bb9-0baeabecc5d4">
   Power Loader emerges from the explosions, inviting the students to see the new set-up in the Development Studio, revealing they are in charge of both developing and controlling the U.A. Barrier. Izuku hands Mei his Mid-Gauntlet, asking if she can fix it for him, but she immediately says no, due to how damaged it is and not having the available materials. Tenya then asks for repairs for his armor, but just as quickly she shuts him down due to not having a spec sheet. Two of her classmates approach the two saying they’ll make it for them.
  </p>
  <p key="b64f8a1a-0bc6-4e5c-91cd-71ff083cff04">
   Tenya is surprised that Mei would turn down the offer due to how much she loves making things, as they look on to see her currently working on the evacuation shelter blocks. Power Loader tells them that Mei was brought on to help strengthen the barrier, and she’s been busy creating new mechanisms in case of mass evacuation. Power Loader compliments her inventive mind, and she responds with how she always needs to try think up new “babies” to improve themselves.

  <p key="2b060f5a-7acf-4e18-973e-36810c2799f3">
   After Mei tells Izuku about how even she is aware of the trouble Heroes are facing now, and that inventing stuff is how the support course does heroics, she suddenly throws a pair of Air Force Gloves attached to new make-shift Gauntlets right at his face, saying that she couldn’t make an exact copy but it’s the best she can do. She proceeds to throw a new piece of armor for Tenya right at his face too, exasperating the support students that she did it all so fast. She concludes saying for them to tell the rest of the hero students that they’ll all win this.

   Outside, Izuku and Tenya meet up with the rest of Class 1-A and Mt. Lady, who reminds them that even after learning what they just dealt with, their main objective is tracking down and eliminating the remnants of the villains and they must do it all without haste. Following Izuku, the Class 1-A Search Squad assembles and heads out.
