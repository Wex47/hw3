As the president speaks, Hawks tries to whisper to Endeavor about the feel of being Number 1 Hero, but the Flame Hero just glares at him.

   The top ten Heroes begin to give their comments one by one: Ryukyu honestly says she does not feel worthy to be in the top ten, because there are lives she could not save and promises she strive to become a hero worthy of her rank.

   Back stage, Endeavor confronts Hawks on his provocations as Hawks explains him that he was simply trying to make an impact so that Endeavor could look better. Hawks reveals that he was never an All Might fan and never wanted to be like him but his retirement was a big shock to him. Hawks believes that society does not need an icon Hero like All Might but a leader with a mental fortitude to support them all, believing that Endeavor has such a quality and is impressed by him.
  </p>
  <p key="73676b32-d75d-47af-8ae3-1eca689028fc">
   Wondering if Hawks being truthful, sarcastic or mocking him, Endeavor asks him why he doesn't become this leader, to which Hawks admits that he would rather be lower in the rankings so that he would have more freedom. Endeavor bluntly states his displeasure for Hawks and ends their conversation, telling him to apologize to everyone else as he walks away. Then Hawks tells Endeavor the reason he wanted to talk to him is because he wants to team up with Endeavor, since there are apparently Nomu activities in his home area. This catches Endeavor's attention.

Endeavor overhears a fan of his being too scared to approach him for an autograph, so he heads over and offers it. It turn out the be a hardcore fan that dislike his new persona because the "real Endeavor isn't supposed to give fanservice", thus, he is heartbroken and runs off claiming that he changed, which leaves Endeavor confused.

   Later, while eating lunch at yakitori restaurant on the top of a building, Hawks laughs at Endeavor's experience, believing that the kid was right about Endeavor's attitude since it is his personality, and asks for a helping of Endeavor's meal if he isn't having it, to which Endeavor comments on Hawks' greed and gluttony. Hawks admits that its in his nature for him wanting to get something he wants.

   He also mentions Shoto, as he wanted to offer him to intern with his brand. But after what happened, he’s glad that he got Fumikage instead since Shoto failed the provisional exam. Otherwise, his brand would be damaged, much to Endeavor's anger who finds it strange that Hawks has knowledge of that despite not being a U.A graduate. Having had enough of the useless talk, Endeavor demands to know about the rumors he has been hearing. Endeavor surmises that he must have some proof about there being other Nomus for him to take such an interest in. Hawks casually replies that all he's got are rumors, and Endeavor angrily starts shouting for the staff to bring the check.
  </p>
  <p key="a522defa-ef2f-40b1-b6f7-d2db2ecf515f">
   Hawks asks Endeavor to calm down, and explains the situation. He informs the rumors isn't just in his area but the entire country as he has heard it from wives gossiping or school children chatting on the way home. Hawks reveals he has been working with the police to discover the origin of these rumors, and although they have not yet discovered anything, the rumors do not stop spreading around the country instilling fear in the civilians, and it will cause everyone to lose their minds. Hawks uses the random villain he defeated on the way as it reflects that notion. He was influenced by a reprinting of Destro's autobiography. Hawks believes that the more fear that is stirred up the more it sells.

   Tired of his banter that has gone nowhere, Endeavor demands to know the point Hawks is trying to make. Hawks basically asks Endeavor, as the no. 1 hero, to lay these rumors to rest and show the citizens that there is nothing to fear. Hawks wants to live in an ideal world where all Heroes can take leisure in their work without ever stressing out, wanting Heroes to have more free time.

   Suddenly, both heroes notice a dark figure in the sky approaching at full speed towards where they are. The waitress arrives to bring them the check but Hawks immediately pulls her away, as Hood's head crashes through the glass windows, asking who is the strongest. Endeavor orders Hawks to evacuate everyone as he deals with the Nomu. Endeavor sees that the rumors were true and is glad that this was well timed.

  <p key="9ec74b56-f2c6-49b5-94ca-a1d8fb7edb62">
   Endeavor incinerates Hood’s arm to frees himself, but Hood regenerates the lost limb and wraps Endeavor to fling him through the entire building, destroying several of the top floors. Endeavor gets a hold of himself and admits that the Nomu is stronger and faster than him. The top half of the building begins collapsing., but Hawks successfully evacuates civilians with his Fierce Wing Quirk, and quickly moves to help Endeavor in the fight.
  </p>
  <p key="f43fd7c2-dc38-47bb-90ba-d2f8fe6ba16d">
   This gives Endeavor an opening to attack again with an advanced version of
   Hell Spider
   ,
   striking the High-End with multiple fire streams which cuts up its body, and pulverizing the top of building to prevent the debris from causing damage. In spite of everything, the monster manages to survive the attack since the flames missed his head, which moves away to regenerate the missing body. Other heroes start attacking him while he is regenerating, so Hood releases several minor Nomu through the streets of the city to attack the heroes and citizens, forcing Hawks to have to help them, leaving Endeavor alone to face Hood.
  </p>
  <p key="1f6c4128-6463-4745-bf40-3d4a75a2419b">
   Endeavor understands that he is in a dangerous situation. The High-End Nomu has been shown to possess at least six Quirks and is smart enough to think rationally. Also, due to the drawback of his Hellflame Quirk his body is overheating. Hood realizes this and taunts him. Endeavor decides to end the fight as soon as possible. Endeavor ignites viciously and releases a powerful fire blast called
   Prominence Burn
   , burning Nomu's body to ash.
  </p>
  <p key="01ccd344-a7a4-4f06-8842-35df38ff3ee7">
   It seems that Hood is defeated, but Endeavor realizes too late that the Nomu tore his head off to avoid completely being incinerated, and while regenerates his body, he attacks Endeavor with elastic bone-blades and striking him in the torso and in the face, potentially destroying his left eye. Endeavor is knocked out and Hood stands over his injured body, saying he finds the battle boring and wonders if there are any stronger Heroes for him to fight. A news helicopter above reports the battle: that several Pro Heroes are fighting Nomu while the new Number One Hero, Endeavor, is lying on the ground after being severely beaten.

It turn out that the Endeavor’s fan from earlier calls out the TV crew for giving up on Endeavor, pointing out that his flames are still burning and telling the viewers to not give up hope on Endeavor so easily since he is fighting for their sake.
  </p>
  <p key="c7fca3e4-9811-440c-9a07-2e92acc8e5ba">
   Despite the injures and the pain, Endeavor uses his Quirk once more to project himself after Hood, who wonders if he has regeneration but Endeavor was aware that his body was immobile and he was only raising his flames to propel himself and needed a strategy to kill the Nomu since it was impossible to merely capture it. As both duel in the sky, Hawks steps in to assist Endeavor, attacking Hood by surprise while the Nomu tries to get rid of him. The No. 2 Hero remembers watching Endeavor being the only hero who is trying to surpass All Might.

   Hood attacks Hawks again, succeeding in striking him, but not before he used his feathers to enhance Endeavor's speed, allowing Endeavor to be launched at the villain.
   Thrust by Hawks' feathers, Endeavor uses the speed to punch Hood through his teeth and tries to burn it from the inside out. He takes note of the Nomu's behavior being similar to a wild beast before noticing his regenerative powers were still active and screams for Hawks to give him more speed to help.
  </p>
  <p key="c53c2cd4-ed5f-4489-97ea-8c5f8a4c0885">
   Even though the feathers are almost burned, Endeavor asks him to use what he has left to push him and High-End into the sky. Hawks obey Endeavor's indication, until he states that his feathers are practically ash. Endeavor says it was more than enough and uses a last blast to send him and Hood far from the city. Before his final attack, Endeavor tells Hood that he resembles his self from the past or maybe from a distant future, but it's time for him to burn up and be put to rest. Endeavor goes beyond his limits and chants the school motto that he's hated for so long. He uses Plus Ultra Prominence Burn to incinerate Hood.

   Witnesses and spectators stare in shock at the intense fireball impressed until Endeavor and High-End fall from it, crashing down onto the ground with a fiery impact. When the flames and smoke disperse, Hood's corpse is thoroughly incinerated and Endeavor emerges from the dust standing with one arm held high, injured but striking a victorious pose.

   In a dark warehouse, Dabi meets with Hawks and it's revealed that they set the attack up. Hawks points a feather blade at the latter as he is angry that Dabi reneged on their agreement as Dabi mentions he couldn't trust Hawks' integrity and believes he was right by bringing up Hawks' decision to bring Endeavor as the hero chosen to help him stop the threat and Hawks saving people, despite supporting the League's intentions.
  </p>
  <p key="59629653-276c-4a99-a010-4e89429fb53d">
   Hawks justifies his actions by telling him that he has to keep up appearance and mentions Endeavor was injured so it wasn't a total waste. He also says he must keep up his image as a Hero in order to better relay information to the League. Understanding, Dabi walks away, telling Hawks him he wasn't going to see the boss just yet but promised to contact him again.
  </p>
  <p key="ad84c8bd-34bc-4164-8249-176ca33d2734">
   As he walks to the hospital where Endeavor is admitted, Hawks recalls being assigned by the Hero Public Safety Commission to the mission of gaining the League of Villains' trust in order to obtain information from them since he was the most qualified for the double agent role. Hawks feels the strain of maintaining his charade and guilt at Endeavor's condition which he internally apologizes for as he visits the latter.

  <p key="63317df0-011e-442f-9a91-74b37f30f187">
   Meanwhile, while overlooking the city from a pier, Dabi finally remembers who Snatch was. He remembers Snatch asking if he ever thinks about the families of his victims, and remarks that thinking about what Snatch asked him drove him crazy, wiping away a tear of blood from under his left eye's staple.

   Disgusted and surprised, Natsuo leaves as Fuyumi panics, recounting the events that led up this moment and frantically talking to Shoto that she was really happy at the progress she thought was being made and they might be family. Shoto replies by telling Fuyumi that he had never seen Natsuo get emotional like that before.

In that strange place he sees the previous users of All For One, and also two men, two brothers, facing each other. He recognizes that this is similar to the vision he had during the

   In his dream, Izuku realizes that he can move his right hand, but aside from that and the upper half of his head, the rest of his body is missing. Izuku notices that apart from him only seven successors of One For All are beside him, when there should be eight. When he hears the two men arguing, Izuku finally manages to identify them: one is the man who would become known as the villain

  </p>
  <p key="37cd939c-9d43-4553-b707-6c42255d2da7">
   Both brother arguing are about society's current state of affairs brought upon by the advent of Quirks. The first user reproaches his older brother for using his powers to fulfil his dark goals. All For One simply decides to introduce him to two men: one of them has a quirk while the other is Quirkless. The man with the Quirk is an outcast of society due to his powers, while the Quirkless one wishes to have powers. The younger brother knows what is about to happen and warns them not to do it, but All For One uses his powers to remove the first man's Quirk and give a Quirk to the second. In return, All For One only asks them their loyalty. The two men accept, grateful for his help.
  </p>
  <p key="77bf0b74-a5e8-4ee2-9ff0-8fe797a39c9c">
   All For One explains to his brother that he used the two men as examples of why his power is so important in that era of chaos, as there are people who need his powers. He uses his power to take Quirks away from those who don’t want it, and to give Quirks to those who want it. He has established himself as a figure of unity. The younger brother reproaches him that the only thing he does is using his powers to obtain loyal followers.

  <p key="d8b30c5c-e528-48bd-9cef-0dd5801584a8">
   All For One claims his Quirk is able to return order to the world that has lost its humanity at the hands of Quirks. Enraged by All For One's manipulative words and false pretenses, the young brother charges at him, but is quickly pinned down by the latter's personal bodyguard. All For One berates his young brother for not having a Quirk, but says that he still loves him as he is his only family.

  <p key="0b4daa34-4ac3-492c-a5ed-07840af30626">
   The setting of the dream suddenly changes, and Izuku finds himself in a city in a dystopian era, when the appearance of the Quirks disrupted societal norms and led to mass disorder. He witnesses a group of thugs with Quirks assaulting normal people who can barely defend themselves, until All For One suddenly appeared and snatched the Quirks from the villains. All For One didn’t bother to stop the bloodshed that ensued when the victims turned on their now powerless attackers, who were forced to join him if they wanted to live, or that he gave the victims Quirks to fight back. In this way, he soon manages to form his own organization with loyal followers.

  <p key="d96e7653-c436-4c42-afd1-26ebfa54c3fa">
   The scene changes again, showing All For One visiting his brother who he has kept imprisoned, and comments on how his health has deteriorated by refusing to eat. The younger brother replies that he does it in rebellion, since he does not intend to submit to him. All For One advises him to give up and tells him about how a group who refused to join him were killed. He explains his followers killed them, even if he didn’t give the order, They did it simply out of respect for him knowing that he considered them a threat in his quest for order
  </p>
  <p key="5701a1e5-ebe2-4bd1-8ad4-5c5c57d839da">
   All For One references a comic books the two brothers read together as children as a parallel to the current situation. The little brother reminds him that he never finished reading the comics, well it doesn't matter how many times the bad guy wins in those comics, he eventually loses to the hero in the end. Enraged at this defiance, All For One grabs his brother's forehead, telling him to see reality his way. He tells his brother that if he refuses to submit to him, he will force him to do so, since he has a Quirk that even he, despite his feeble body, can use. Despite his little brother's refusal, All For One forces the Quirk on him.

   Izuku instinctively raises his hand to help him and the vision dissolves, but to his surprise the first user of One For All speaks directly to him, recognizing him as the ninth inheritance of the Quirk. Izuku is shocked, as he was interacting with the vestiges, something that All Might had told him was not possible. The first user tells Izuku he wanted to show a bit more of the past, but cannot as Izuku can only manage 20% of One For All so far. The brother assures Izuku that he's not alone and takes his hand

Izuku keeps staring at his glowing right hand, because the One For All activated by its own.
