   There is an area beneath the hospital that locked down. The informant was unable to uncover any legitimate uses for space and found out only Doctor Garaki used it. Through further investigation, the insider was able to get a photo of Doctor Garaki going through the morgue into an elevator with a small Nomu inside.

   Following the debriefing, Endeavor asks Naomasa if it was "him" who leaked the info about the hospital. Naomasa knows he's talking about Hawks, but decides to keep things as cryptic as possible. Endeavor walks off and as the mission begins he recalls Hawks telling him to ready their forces and the next generation. Just as the No. 2 Hero asked, Endeavor has achieved both those goals.

   Endeavor leads the team of heroes inside Jaku General Hospital, surprising the staff members inside. Before long he's able to locate Doctor Garaki, who's calmly walking through the hallways of the medical center. Completely ignorant of the situation, the doctor thinks to himself about how Tomura's procedure will be finished within the next month. His daydream is interrupted when Endeavor surprises him from behind by calling out the doctor as

   The Doctor runs in terror while Endeavor and his team pursue. However, he falls over and begins to rapidly age as a result of Shota Aizawa's Erasure Quirk. Endeavor surmises the registry was wrong and the doctor has a Quirk that de-ages him. Naomasa speculates on what the doctor has been using these types of Quirks for and

   The other doctors nearby intervene and force Present Mic to stop roughing up Kyudai. The heroes force them to evacuate with everyone else in the hospital. While most of the heroes focus on evacuation, Mirko heads straight for the morgue. Eraser ties up the Kyudai with his binding weapon and declares that this is revenge for everyone the doctor has messed with.

   Endeavor checks in with Mirko via a telecommunications device in their ears. She heads further into the hideout and discovers that down the dark hallways of the unused sector in the hospital, Nomu are beginning to emerge. Mirko warns Endeavor that the Nomu are coming and they suddenly break through the walls of the hospital to attack the heroes. One of the larger Nomu manages to pierce the Doctor's body, revealing he was actually a double, created by a duplicated version of

   Meanwhile, the real mad Doctor has been devoting all his time to Tomura Shigaraki while his double has handled everything at the hospital. Knowing that all his life work is here, the Doctor regrets needing to flee the hospital. He orders Johnny to warp him and Tomura away at once. However, Mirko suddenly bursts through the wall and crushes little Johnny with the debris. Mirko asks if he's the real doctor and all he can do in response is once again cry out in terror.

   By crashing into the laboratory, Mirko destroys a number of Nomu tanks, and duplication equipment along with Johnny. Mirko tells Endeavor that she found the doctor and receives orders to capture him immediately. Endeavor wants to try and catch up with her after frying one of the larger Nomu, but he's still fighting alongside Eraser, Rock Lock and several other heroes against countless Nomu.

Ochaco simply replies that if her way of life causes her to hurt people, then she has have to live with those consequences. Ochako's words emotionally hurt Himiko, who realizes that she is right. When he prepares to attack her, Tsuyu appears, so Himiko decides to run away. Tsuyu prepares in case she attacks again, but Ochaco tells her that she won't, and wonders why Himiko was suddenly crying.

   Meanwhile, at the battlefield, Shoto rescues Deku, and tries to apply first aid to him, his father, and Katsuki. To they horror, they see that Tomura is still active, using the tendrils of his Rivet Stab quirk to move around. In side him, All For One's will tells him to retreat but Tomura retorts he isn't the boss of him. Suddenly, he gets blasted by Nejire's Wave Motion as Tenya runs to Shoto reporting that Gigantomachia is making his way to their current location. Shoto tells Ingenium to get the injured out of the area, as he and Nejire fight Tomura. Izuku tells Tenya to focus on Katsuki and Endeavor, because Tomura is after his Quirk. In the distance, Gigantomachia is getting closer and closer to them.

  <p key="cadea2fc-094b-4e91-9ef3-d16fb4e1fc8c">
   Knowing that Tomura is very weakened due to the punishment received, Shoto and Nejire try to take him down, using his Quirks at full power, but Gigantomachia eventually makes it there to assist his master, swatting them aside with his giant hand. Gigantomachia retrieves the now unconscious Tomura and places him on his back, where Spinner tries to tend to him, asking him to order Gigantomachia to do something.

  <p key="90c45bef-edd4-4d6c-8eec-b79342e93fd1">
   Dabi emerges from the back of Gigantomachia and greets Endeavor and Shoto as Endeavor calls him by his name. Dabi, however, requests to be called by his true name as he washes off the black coloration on his white hair. Dabi then reveals that his true identity is that of Toya Todoroki. His proclamation shocked everyone but not as much as Endeavor and Shoto, who are horrified to their very core.
  </p>
  <p key="78ed5bf8-35a6-4d57-a5bf-00a51cf61cd0">
   Endeavor refuses to believe that Dabi is his deceased firstborn, but Dabi assures him that it is the truth and that right now, with the help of Skeptic, he is broadcasting his pre-recorded history, revealing his relationship with Endeavor as well his abusive past on his family.
  </p>
  <p key="d9dab30f-6e20-464e-898c-28e44c793b00">
   Dabi confesses that he had always wanted revenge on him by making him suffer as much as possible. He originally thought about killing Shoto but a better opportunity presented itself when he became Japan's number 1 hero. He decided to hope he was at the top of his reputation, organized the attacks from Starservant and Ending to help him climb, and now that the hero society itself is reeling from that conflict, he has decided to wait until he is at the top of his reputation, organized the attacks by Starservant and Ending to help him climb, to crush him physically and morally when the opportunity presented itself, destroying his reputation in the face of society.

  <p key="6af5425a-34ea-46b5-9879-9b405029e8ba">
   And now that the hero society itself is reeling from that conflict, the perfect opportunity has come, and now he's revealing many of Endeavor's darkest secrets to give the last push. And to rub salt into the wound, his video also shows some of the Hawks' secrets and crimes, revealing that he is the son of a thief and a murderer, showing him killing Twice when he was trying to run away, and stating that he killed Best Jeanist while he was recuperating.
  </p>
  <p key="e94eddbc-8d24-4a51-a1c3-75400e8abf45">
   Dabi mockingly thanks Endeavor for going strong up until now as he jumped off Gigantomachia's back, ready to attack him with a Prominence Burn. Shoto tries to get his shocked father to protect Deku and the others and worry about the rest later while he and Nejire fight him off. As Dabi prepares to finish Endeavor off, Best Jeanist himself jumps from a plane with several carbon fibers wires containers, which he uses to tie up all of the Lieutenants of the Paranormal Liberation Front with his Quirk, including Gigantomachia and the unconscious Tomura.

  <p key="f9a6a04b-0d5f-4b19-90ed-0b5478ff3479">
   Dabi is in disbelief seeing him alive since he was positive Hawks brought him a dead body, but Best Jeanist declares that Dabi overreached with his ambitions and now he will come apart like inferior denim. Dabi, however, says that even if Best Jeanist is alive, that won't sweep under the rug the Todoroki Family's hard truth. Spinner is ensnarled with Tomura and realizes that Gigantomachia needs to have an order to do anything, so he desperately pleads Tomura to wake up. Nejire tries to strike them, but unfortunately she gets blasted by Dabi's flames, as he's burning through the wires. Tomura briefly wakes up and orders Gigantomachia to destroy, to which the latter agrees and begins to tear his restrains.

   Not far from there, three of the Nomu Near High-End who are fighting the heroes hear Gigantomachia's call and move towards Tomura's position. Burning tries to stop them, but one Near High-End tries to attack her only to be attacked by someone else.

  <p key="18da8bcb-be13-4fa0-bf66-7bcab8b69e98">
   Back in the main fight, while Jeanist's best tart from Gignatomachia, Shoto faces his brother. He reveals to Dabi that Ending way nearly killed Natsuo. Dabi, however, merely says it was a shame he didn't because that would have made their father suffer even more. An incredulous Shoto asks his brother if he is insane and Dabi confirms he doesn't feel anything anymore. He starts to push Shoto back, excited at the thought of finally being able to kill his little brother.

   The three Nomus arrive and prepare to attack Best Jeanist. Izuku tries to move to help him, but he can't due  his body is very badly hurt. All of a sudden, Mirio Togata arrives, using his Permeation Quirk to punch the Nomu away from Best Jeanist, leaving Izuku shocked,
   who asks him how did he get here. He replies that they received a message about the current situation in Jaku City from the Villa team, so he rushed there at once using his Permeation's special mode of travel.

  <p key="d54af9bf-0a01-44b7-9b20-1670b51a998b">
   The High-End quickly recover from the blows and return to attack Best Jeanist. Mirio realizes that he is unable to protect Best Jeanist alone and screams for help. Tenya, Nejire and Katsuki appear and engage them, saving the hero. At this moment, Katsuki yells at Best Jeanist that his hero name is "Great Explosion Murder God Dynamight". Everyone considers the name ridiculous, except Mirio, who thinks it's funny.

   Meanwhile, Dabi overcomes his youngest brother and traps him in his arms, ready to unleashes his blue flames to kill him.  Shoto warns him that in doing so, he would burn himself as well, but Dabi looks at Endeavor, who still has a look of horror on his face, and says that he is excited at the thought of Endeavor about to see his 'puppet masterpiece' gets incinerated. Suddenly, Izuku shoot a

However, Izuku’s words help Endeavor break out of his trance, and uses every bit of strength he has to fly up and knock the giant back, knocking himself out as a result. Gigantomachia starts losing strength, and Mirio explains that he got a word from the U.A. students from the backup team: It seems that the sedative they managed to make the Behemoth swallow several minutes ago is finally working.
  </p>
  <p key="242e6a19-10ff-4801-baee-5666ff9cc003">
   After this, both Izuku and Endeavor lose consciousness. With Gigantomachy out and the student facing the Nomu, Best Jeanist redirects his efforts to retain the League of Villains, a uses his super move Blackout Bind to choke the members of the League in his grasp to knock them unconscious. To his surprise, Mr. Compress uses his Quirk to gouge out a section of his own flesh, which allow his escape and compress Tomura and Spinner.

   Best Jeanist tries to take control of the fibers on his clothes to slow him down, saying that he has no hope of escaping with wounds that fatal, but Mr. Compress continues to use his Quirk to pop off parts of his body. He also compress Dabi and Skeptic. Mirio and Best Jeanist's cables charge toward Mr. Compress to stop him but he, after revealing he is descendant of

   Mr. Compress, after having hidden Dabi and Skeptic's marbles in Spinner's scarf, tries to buys some time to his lizard fellow to wake Tomura up, but Mirio easily defeats Mr. Compress, who regrets that he could not be of more useful. As Mirio is about to strike Spinner too, the villain remembers what his leader said before about the hands of his deceased family bringing him a sickening rage and puts one of those hands onto Tomura's face. This allows Tomura to reawaken, though All For One's consciousness is in control.

   "Tomura" uses the Radio Waves blow Mirio, the cables, and all the other fighting heroes away, while also calls all the Near High-Ends for help. Soon, a large group of these creatures arrive to take All For One and Tomura's allies from there. Best Jeanist attempts to restrain them with the cables, while Nejire, Tenya and Mirio also trying to stop them, but they fail, and "Tomura" manages to escape along with Spinner and a large number of Near High-End Nomu.

   Spinner reminds All For One of their allies still fighting, but the villain coldly states that since Tomura lost, it is only fair that he pays for that loss and subsequently abandons the remaining members. Just before they leave, Izuku attempts to stop All For One, but the villain easily blasts him away with an air cannon and tells the hero that they will meet again once Tomura's body is perfected.

   As "Tomura" and his allies escape the battlefield, the remaining Pro Heroes who survived in the front-line, along with the ones who finished with rescue and evacuation, promptly headed to the front to stop him, but All For One dispatches three Nomus to confront them. The Near High-End’s distraction tactics he, his allies, and seven other Nomu manage to escape while the other three confront the heroes until they are destroyed.
