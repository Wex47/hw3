   Midnight gives Class 1-A 15 minutes to decide on Hero names. After 15 minutes have passed, each student starts to reveal the hero name they chose. After most of the Class 1-A has revealed their Hero names, only Izuku and Tenya are left (besides Katsuki who needs to change his name). Tenya has struggled in deciding whether to use his older brother's hero name

   Izuku is the last student to reveal his hero name. He reveals it, and it causes some of his classmates to ask if he is okay with it, to which Izuku replies that up until now he didn't like it at all. Izuku says, however, that someone came along and changed the meaning of the name making him happy. Izuku reveals his hero name to be Deku, saying with confidence that Deku will be his Hero name. Katsuki looks on in anger while Ochaco smiles at Izuku's hero name.

   After Class 1-A has finished formulating their hero names, Shota tells his students that their field training will be one week long. He says that the students who received nominations will get a personalized list of work places to choose from. Shota gives the students who didn't receive nominations lists that have 40 work places to choose from. Shota tells his class to choose one work place from their respective lists, saying that they have until the end of the week to make their work place choices.

   After school that day, All Might appears in front of Izuku Midoriya as he is about to leave class. All Might and Izuku walk along the corridor. All Might says that Izuku received a nomination, much to Izuku's surprise. All Might tells Izuku that the person who nominated him was Gran Torino. All Might explains that Gran Torino was a Pro Hero who taught at U.A. for one year and that

   All Might says that Gran Torino knows about the One For All Quirk which is the reason why he must have nominated Izuku. Izuku notes that even All Might is nervous from talking about Gran Torino, wondering how scary the retired Pro Hero was. All Might tells Izuku that while it is his duty to train him, he should select Gran Torino as his work place of choice and go see what he can learn from him. Before leaving, All Might informs Izuku that his Hero costume has been repaired. Thus, Izuku chooses Gran Torino as his work place to train at.

   At the same time in the staff room, Shota is surprised that some of his students chose the work place that they want to train at already. He looks at Tenya Ida's work place choice which is the Hosu City Hero Office, noting that there were better nominations for him to choose from. The day of the work place field training arrives. Shota Aizawa is at the station with his class to escort them to their work places safely.

At Gran Torino's apartment, Izuku sneaks out and goes to an alley in order to test out his new discovery about One For All (thinking of One For All as a simple body function) to use it All more fluently by jumping from one wall to another, only to fail. Izuku continues this self-training until morning.
  </p>
  <p key="d3fdfbbb-68da-488c-addf-a17543580aa5">
   In the morning, Izuku tells Gran Torino that he was trying his new method but found it to be difficult. Gran Torino comments that it is difficult due to him only just discovering the proper method of using One For All and states that All Might was able to use One For All normally when he first obtained it thanks to his body which is why All Might’s guidance towards Izuku isn’t working.

  <p key="c0c5b4b8-941d-498d-bf4e-1d14bf20ab46">
   Gran Torino informs Izuku that All Might couldn’t handle One For All emotionally due to it being passed down by a late friend. Izuku is fascinated by All Might’s past and asks about All Might’s predecessor, much to Gran Torino’s surprise. A delivery arrives at the door which Izuku fetches. The delivery is a new microwave to replace the other one Gran Torino broke yesterday during their mock battle. Gran Torino decides they should have breakfast now, telling Izuku to set up the new microwave.

Annoyed, he goes to check the microwave, telling Izuku that he didn't put the microwave's plate in properly and as a result, it didn't turn and only a part of the taiyaki was heated. His comment causes Izuku to realize his next problem with One For All; that he has been using One For All on one body part and not on his whole body.

   Gran Torino tells Izuku that if he can move around while having One For All coursing through his body, then he will be drawing a clear line from how he was during the Sports Festival. Gran Torino says that their mock battle will be three minutes for starters. The mock battle begins and Gran Torino hits Izuku from behind, stopping the flow of One For All throughout Izuku's body.

Gran Torino heads towards the couch, but suddenly, Izuku punches the couch away, sending it flying and stopping Gran Torino's attack.

   Now that One For All is flowing throughout his body, Izuku leaps into the air and nearly manages to hit Gran Torino, however, the elderly hero manages to dodge in the nick of time. Gran Torino jumps forward and prepares to attack Izuku from behind, but Izuku dodges the elderly Hero's attempt by jumping into the air above him. Izuku, seeing that he is in a perfect position, sends a One For All enhanced punch at Gran Torino. However, the elderly hero manages to dodge Izuku's attempt. Izuku starts falling down while Gran Torino leaps from the wall and strikes Izuku in his stomach, smacking Izuku down onto the ground and causing One For All to stop its flow.

  <p key="befd2f23-bbe1-4c83-a607-dcf41789c80e">
   Gran Torino sees that three minutes are up and ends the mock battle for now. Izuku laments on his lack of ability to keep the activation of One For All throughout his body properly. However, Gran Torino compliments Izuku's intelligence. The elderly hero notes to himself that Izuku has dramatically changed in such a short space of time and compliments Izuku for being able to graze him (a cut is shown on Gran Torino's face) even though he was using his own power earnestly. Gran Torino states to Izuku that he must get used to using One For All throughout his body and informs him that they will continue training after breakfast. After breakfast, Izuku continues his training with Gran Torino.

   Unfortunately, Selkie and his men fall into a trap and he dispatches Sirius and Froppy to pursue the villains. Using her Quirk, Sirius hears Selkie tell her this boat was a decoy and they must pursue the real stowaways. Selkie and Tsuyu find the villain's ship docked between two large rocks. Sirius captures the lookout and with Tsuyu board the ship. They are immediately attacked by the criminal ringleader:

   Innsmouth wraps his tentacles around Sirius and threatens to crush her if Tsuyu doesn't tell her superiors to call off the search. Inspired by Sirius' words from earlier, Tsuyu gives away their location, angering Innsmouth. The villain attacks and Tsuyu jumps around to avoid his blows. She tries to use her tongue to secure Sirius, but Innsmouth grabs it and slams her into one of the rocks.

Afterwards, Tsuyu tells Sirius she's discovered whats important about being a hero. The criminals are all arrested and illegal drugs were taken. The Coast Guard thanks Selkie and he credits Froppy with being a great hero.

    Workplace Training Ends
   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="3aa93dc8-ee08-4d26-bbb9-1accd1bc379f">
   At the end of the week, workplace training comes to an end. Outside Gran Torino's apartment, Izuku thanks Gran Torino for looking after him and training him. Izuku praises Gran Torino for his training as it has allowed him to become stronger. Gran Torino advises Izuku to maintain his control and composure when using One For All and to not go over the 5% limit. Izuku says that he will comply. Izuku asks Gran Torino a question; why a strong hero like him isn't known by society. Gran Torino replies that he wasn't interested in the hero life and that the only reason he became a certified hero was for a certain goal and nothing else.
  </p>
  <p key="2142e0d9-18ca-4a50-89da-081c339feae9">
   Gran Torino tells Izuku to ask All Might about the whole story. As Izuku leaves, Gran Torino ponders that both All Might and Izuku are alike, having the same charisma. Gran Torino asks Izuku his name, Izuku thinks than Gran Torino went back to being senile, but realizes what he wants as an answer. Izuku tells Gran Torino that his name his Deku. Gran Torino smiles at the response, turns around and goes back into his apartment.

   With their internships concluded, Class 1-A returns to U.A. High and talk to one another about their experience. Denki notes that the people who improved the most are Izuku, Tenya and Shoto because of their encounter with the Hero Killer. Most of the class approaches them and asks what happened, but Shoto says that Endeavor saved them from the Hero Killer instead of the truth.
  </p>
  <p key="94a77ee4-9457-47a0-a7ce-d70bc127d668">
   Denki comments that Stain is kind of cool despite being a villain. Izuku scolds Denki for this, prompting the latter to apologize, but Tenya says its fine because he understands if people find the Hero Killer "cool" due to his convictions. However, Tenya says that does not justify his criminal acts. Inspired to walk the heroic path once again, Tenya returns to his old form and loudly asks the class to take their seats. Everyone is annoyed by Tenya's loud antics, but Izuku think's he's cool for returning to the path of heroism.
  </p>
  <p key="a5a3bf6e-4880-468b-aa00-86d472422dc9">
   Afterward, Class 1-A attends their next class: Foundational Hero Studies with All Might. All Might says that their lesson will be a rescue training race through Playing Ground Gamma (a construction site with many densely packed lanes which makes it look like a labyrinth). The class must race through the construction site and to the area in the middle to meet up with All Might. Class 1-A will split into four groups of five for the training lesson. Izuku, along with Ojiro, Tenya, Mina and Hanta are the first group that will partake in the rescue training race. The class comments on who will win; Momo and Kyoka note that Izuku is at a disadvantage due to his grievous Quirk with Katsuki saying that Izuku will lose, others think that Tenya, Ojiro, Sero and Mina all have an equal chance at winning.
  </p>
  <p key="5f1efe69-17dd-4d82-bb1f-b690b430eab9">
   The race begins, with Sero leading before Izuku activates One For All Full Cowl:5% and begins maneuvering through the construction site with ease; using his enhanced speed and agility to jump and move through the construction site while outpacing his classmates. All Might, Shoto and Ochaco take note of his extraordinary movements while the rest of the class are surprised by Izuku's improved skills and better control of his Quirk since they had previously counted him out. Katsuki is shocked that Izuku's movements in combat have become similar to his own, angry that Izuku has improved so much.
  </p>
  <p key="81542910-f2b6-41e4-8bdb-6ab7b62ebf9d">
   However, while moving towards the area, Izuku accidentally slips, causing him to lose his lead and arrive last while Hanta places first. After the race ends, All Might commends the group on improving their Quirks more broadly since entering U.A. He asks them to prepare for the end-of-term test. All Might then approaches Izuku, telling him that he is impressed with his improvement and gives him a thumbs up. All Might tells Izuku that after the lesson is finished, he should come to his place because he wants to talk to Izuku about the story of him and One For All.

  <p key="35edde9b-3f4f-4522-8c27-451513daf2ed">
   Foundational Hero Studies end and Izuku changes into his school uniform. Afterward, Izuku heads to the Break Room to meet with All Might. All Might tells Izuku to lock the door and then apologizes to Izuku for not being at his side during the Hosu incident, to which Izuku replies that he doesn't have to apologize. All Might says that Izuku's blood was ingested by the Hero Killer, reminding Izuku about One For All transfer and inheritance method, causing Izuku to panic, thinking that One For All is in Stain's possession.
  </p>
  <p key="f56e53f1-1347-4735-9ec4-2a5efccc2cea">
   However, All Might tells Izuku that he still has One For All because One For All won't be transferred to a new recipient unless the user wishes it, thus One For All cannot be forcibly stolen, although it can be forcibly passed on. All Might tells Izuku that One For All is a special Quirk and begins telling Izuku One For All's origin. All Might says that One For All is derived from a Quirk that has existed since the beginning.
  </p>
  <p key="77f65d77-bb9b-43c9-8e5e-b931ab8cf319">
   All Might says that long ago during the Quirk phenomenon, society had not adapted to the idea of having Quirks which caused an age of upheaval to arise; a man possessing a Quirk called All For One (a Quirk that can steal Quirks and grant them) stole many Quirks and used his new overwhelming power and influence to gather and unify people under his command. The man used the people he gathered as pawns for his plans which allowed to take over Japan and made himself its evil ruler. Izuku says that he has heard rumors but this story is not in any textbook, causing All Might to reply that underground dealings are never recorded in the textbooks.
  </p>
  <p key="32feb76a-a4d1-42ff-93b1-d8545c2ee11f">
   Izuku asks how this man is related to One For All. All Might says that All For One can grant Quirks but those who were not able to handle the strain became braindead like Nomu. All Might explains that there were cases for those who did survive the procedure where their Quirks mutated.
  </p>
  <p key="4e7bf912-8f47-4e99-ba65-6104836288a7">
   All Might tells Izuku another story; the man (who would eventually become Japan's evil ruler) had a Quirkless younger brother; the man used All For One and forcibly gave his younger brother a Quirk that stockpiles power. However, the younger brother already had a Quirk, a Quirk that can transfer itself to others. The younger brother's Quirks (one that stockpiles power and the other that can transfer itself) merged and became One For All.
  </p>
  <p key="56ad9f21-c03a-4ca8-ba04-a1c35b18dfaa">
   All Might notes the irony that justice was born in the bowels of evil. Izuku says that it is impossible for the man who ruled Japan in the distant past to be alive. All Might theorizes that the man stole a Quirk that stopped his aging or a Quirk that granted him immortality. All Might explains that the younger brother, whose Quirks became One For All, fought against his older evil brother but could not defeat him. The younger brother decided to pass on One For All to the next generation so that one day it will accumulate enough power to defeat the older brother's All For One; All Might says that he was finally the successor that defeated the older brother, or so he thought.
  </p>
  <p key="d53d1434-4ef1-4f5a-a78d-2497c4eab2e0">
   All Might tells Izuku that the man possessing All For One has returned and is leading the League of Villains. All Might finishes his story by saying that One For All is a power that is meant to stop All For One and that Izuku will also have to confront the older brother. All Might apologizes for giving Izuku so much information. Izuku says that whatever task All Might gives him he will accomplish no matter what as long as All Might is by his side. All Might isn't able to bring himself to tell Izuku the truth and thanks him instead; All Might isn't able to reveal that he probably won't be by Izuku's side when the time comes.

   Elsewhere, a man is surprised that the Hero Killer: Stain was captured but is still happy that things are going as he has foreseen. He exclaims that Tomura's position is to supervise and unify the new villains who have come to join the League of Villains. The man's doctor expresses doubt if Tomura can do his job and says that if the man stepped in things would be proceeding faster. The man asks the doctor to patch him up faster. The man reveals himself to be Tomura's sensei (the man who possesses All For One) and says that he will let Tomura do all the hard work so that he may become his successor as Tomura was born to do so. Sensei tells All Might to rejoice in the "transient" peace while he still can.
