He orders one of his bombers to self-destruct to seriously damage the building, forcing Captain Celebrity to hold it to prevent its collapse, but leaving him defenseless against the attack of the creatures.

  <p key="0bb8b607-0f8f-4f34-ad27-92e53b09eb52">
   In one of the rooms of the Sky Egg, the heroes and show staff discuss the situation. Best Jeanist deduces that everything that is happening is the result of a meticulous plan that seeks to seal them all in the building. He decides that the best option is for the show staff and a group of heroes to look after the civilians without telling them the truth about what is happening to avoid panic. Meanwhile, another group will go outside to face the creatures.
  </p>
  <p key="87e0cb63-3a22-4512-ac4c-6fabba7b7f21">
   Thanks to Koichi protecting Captain Celebrity, the heroes manage to arrive in time to help. With the help of Edgeshot, Best Jeanist manages to capture the last bomber with his Fiber Master Quirk. After this, he asks Ingenium if what he requested had arrived, and then he is informed of the arrival of a truck transporting carbon fiber cables made for suspension bridges. Best Jeanist descends to the ground and uses his Quirk to manipulate the cables and secure the structure, preventing the Tokyo Sky Egg dome from falling.

   In the distance, Number 6 sees that his plan is about to fail because of the heroes so, in retaliation, he orders the last Bomber to self-destruct. The Bomber frees itself form the fibers and explodes causing the building to begin to crumble.

   Best Jeanist and Edgeshot are surprised at Koichi's skills, and the former admits that they have underestimated Koichi's sheer resolve. Edgeshot follows up that capturing a desparate opponent will be a challenge, as this means they won't be able to prioritize their well being. Best Jeanist agrees, but clarifies that, as Pro Heroes, excuses are beneath them, so they set out to capture The Crawler.

   At Naruhata Station, the Heroes gather intel on how dire the situation is, learning that the blackout extends for kilometers and the roads and railways are suspended.

   Koichi walks in and thanks the heroes for their help before attempting an escape, but is restrained by Eraser Head, effectively putting him under arrest. Best Jeanist and Edgeshot ask why he didn't leave when he had the chance, to which Koichi says that he wanted to thank the heroes. Eraser Head offers to watch over Koichi while he head to the hospital to link up with Naomasa, which they agree to.

   During their fight, Number 6 absorbs the bomber cells of the remaining Anonymous, transforming into a gigantic flaming creature, causing great destruction through the streets of Naruhata in his obsession to destroy Koichi.
   Although he ends up seriously injured, the young vigilante survives long enough not only for Best Jeanits to recover and reunite with Eraser Head, Edgeshot, and Ingenium; but also for a newscopter to broadcast what is happening, which will warn the rest of the heroes of the city.
  </p>
  <p key="f0f00262-b2d5-441f-9032-99e880031c57">
   As they battle, the reporter in the newscopter uses a megaphone to inform the citizens to evacuate the area as soon as posible. Number 6 notices the copter and smack it, causing everyone to fall out of it. Koichi tries to jump for it, but realizes he won’t make it in time to save them.
  </p>
  <p key="42f1ca0a-8c5d-456f-a7a2-811d3456a25a">
   Just then, Best Jeanist arrives and immediately uses his Fiber Quirk to control the strands of the reporter's, cameraman's, and pilot's clothing to save their lives, while also grabbing ahold the megaphone with a thread. The Fiber Hero asks the citizens not to lose hope even in this terrible crisis, reminding them -with Edgeshot, Ingenium, and Eraser Head by his side- that the city still has its heroes.

  <p key="bb3896c0-4ea2-484b-bbcf-77559634c90b">
   Best Jeanist addresses the concerned Naruhata citizens, reassuring them that aid is on the way. Koichi and Eraser Head keep Number 6 busy while the others try to evacuate the civilians, who keep cheering for Koichi. Suddenly, Number 6 pauses for a few seconds, then lets out a scream of rage before splitting out into smaller versions of himself that begin to explode all throughout the city.

  <p key="af0e7bbb-3318-4295-81f0-8c38882c5bda">
   Little by little more heroes arrive to help both protect the citizens and to keep them safe from Number 6's mini bombers. One of the buildings was badly damaged by her suicide attacks and is about to crumble, but Best Jeanist uses the threads of her costume to stop a building from collapsing. People thank Best Jeanist for saving them only to be surprised to see him almost naked when using almost all the textile of his clothes.
  </p>
  <p key="721d27df-3ca4-445e-beed-acd9b0401d55">

Irritated, Katsuki replies that Best Jeanist was the one who sent the offer to him. Best Jeanist tells him that all of his other recruits were well behaved, unlike him.
   Although Best Jeanist admits that Katsuki has outstanding talent, he says the young man still needs to be taught how to display himself as a hero.

   The next day, Best Jeanist tries to teach Katsuki the value of maintaining an elegant outward appearance. He tries lecturing Katsuki about the importance of good behavior and altered Katsuki's appearance to make him look less intimidating by combing his hair into a neat side part, similar to his own. This lead Katsuki to believe that he chose the wrong Hero to intern under. Katsuki's hair returns to its usual messy form shortly after.

  <p key="91f19e0c-06d7-40fc-83af-5427a1b5641b">
   At some point during the internship, while Best Jeanist was combing his hair, he asked Katsuki about his hero name. He tells him that all the names he had chosen had been rejected. Best Jeanist tells him that an alias represents what he wants to be and what he ought to be, so he asks him, when he becomes a second-year student and received his

   Later on, Best Jeanist takes Katsuki on patrol. He tells Katsuki that Hero patrols dissuade Villains from committing crimes and says there is another reason. He asks Katsuki if he know what this other reason is, to which he answers that it is because they can beat up criminals on sight if they do commit a crime. Best Jeanist says this answer is wrong and that patrols help heroes maintain a strong public image and give civilians peace of mind. To emphasize his point, Best Jeanist waved at a group of school girls, who swooned seeing one of the Top 5 Heroes wave at them. Katsuki ends up getting into a spat with young children, making Best Jeanist comment about Katsuki having too much pride.

The hideout team is interrupted when a shadowy figure appears from the dark and Best Jeanist quickly restrains the man by tightening the fibers of his clothes. Mt.

   Best Jeanist realizes he was waiting to unveil all of this dirty information when the Heroes couldn't prevent mass destruction and the people's faith was starting to waiver.

After they save the Hero, Best Jeanist asks the falling Katsuki if he's experienced the world, calling him 'Bakugo', but Katsuki replies that that name was only temporary. He reveals that, starting today, his real hero name is "Great Explosion Murder God Dynamight". Best Jeanist thinks that it's a childish name.

   Best Jeanist continues to use all his might to hold Gigantomachia down, but because of his monstrous strength and Best Jeanist still hasn't fully recovered, Gigantomachia is about to break free from Best Jeanist's fibers, but fortunately Endeavor uses every bit of strength to knock the giant back, knocking himself out as a result. Gigantomachia starts losing strength, and Mirio explains that the sedative that the U.A. students force fed into the behemoth earlier is finally working.

Mirio easily defeats Mr. Compress, and between him and Best Jeanist they are about to catch Tomura and Spinner again. At that moment, All For One's consciousness takes possession of Tomura's body, and uses

   For the next two days, the hero society goes into a deep crisis like never seen before. Shortly after escaping the battlefield, All For One attacks several prisons, rescuing his original body from Tartarus and freeing numerous villains. With everything happening, many Heroes cannot withstand criticism and social pressure, so they decide to withdraw and close their agencies, leaving many places with little protection from the growing number of criminal acts.

  <p key="cb4ce737-b58d-40aa-9e5f-349cd3368c89">
   On the second day, Best Jeanist decides to accompany Hawks to his home, where his mother Tomie resides, taking him in her car. Hawks is still barely recovered from his injuries, needing a device to communicate with Best Jeanist. Along the way, they talk about how Best Jeanist managed to enter a state of apparent death to trick Dabi into allowing Hawks to enter the Paranormal Liberation Front.

  <p key="637392ab-af6a-42ad-a1be-ea840351631c">
   Suddenly, Best Jeanist spots a group of Villains called the Glutton God Gang causing trouble at a marketplace. Best Jeanist steers his car and quickly defeats them. One of the bystanders thank him for apprehending the villains, as Best Jeanist asks him why the police or a local hero hadn't shown up. The bystander explains that the police are too busy with the prison breaks and most of the Pro Heroes have shut down their agencies after all the criticism being lobbed at them.
  </p>
  <p key="050d20bb-9ed4-4bc3-bbe8-ef692b004d84">
   Best Jeanist ensures him that he will dispatch some of his sidekicks to protect the neighborhood, while he notices the civilians reactions. Among the crowd of civilians who congratulate him and thank him for his help, he sees several people seem upset, even hateful, towards the heroes. He even spots one of them wearing a support gear.

  <p key="c9e72c8e-5b6e-49b7-ba2f-696db56c1b86">
   Afterwards, Hawks brings Best Jeanist to his house, wanting to confirm something before showing his face to the public again. He looks for his mother Tomie, only to discover that she had fled, leaving a farewell note, in which she apologizes to him since, as Hawks feared, she was forced to reveal everything she knows about her son Keigo Takami. Best Jeanist tries to console him but he tells him that when he abandoned the name ‘Takami’, and admits he feels relieved all of this has come back to him, and now that the Safety Commission has shut down, there is no one else around to give him orders.
  </p>
  <p key="e3680a97-07bd-4fa2-885a-ade251e36bbd">
   He says to Best Jeanist that when people get backed into a corner or are truly free, that is when they show their true nature, and it is because of that he considered Twice to be such a good person due to his desire to help others, and how he wants to be just like that. He comments that even if what Dabi said about the Todoroki Family is true, he deeply believes things are different now. When Best Jeanist asks what he plans on doing next, Hawks answers that he is going to address his origins to help Endeavor, who he definitely knows is in trouble.
  </p>
  <p key="14244a04-527d-4ada-845f-ce637d33528f">
   Best Jeanist and Hawks go to Grand Central Hospital to talk to Enji Todoroki, waiting outside the room when he is with his family and listening to the conversation between him and his wife Rei about their son Toya, as well as the determination of the entire family to stop him.
  </p>
  <p key="2e7cecb3-a45f-405e-a601-917998246a79">
   Both heroes decide to enter the hospital room to speak with Endeavor, and apologizing for having eavesdropped on them, asking to help them in their proposed family outing. Rei kneels down and apologizes for what her son Toya did, which shocks both Best Jeanist and Hawks, who anxiously tells her not to worry about and apologize for eavesdropping them.

  <p key="ddfe1966-1056-4f87-b972-cefb37001033">
   Hawks proceeds to inform Endeavor about everything that's happened within the past two days, and the terrible crisis that hero society is going through after All For One/Tomura Shigaraki managed to escape. After telling him his only option is to fight, Hawks and Best Jeanist gleefully respond that they'll be assisting him as a team-up with the top three, so he and his family don't have to take on the burden alone. Endeavor tearfully accepts their proposal and this new resolve to move forward. But before getting down to business, they first have to clear up the whole One For All and Izuku Midoriya thing.

  <p key="1d4edfab-f1fa-4bc6-94be-70e29a3ee4e9">
   Best Jeanist and Hawks head to the room where Izuku is resting, still unconscious and wounded from his battle against Tomura.

As they prepare to enter Izuku's room, Tenya Iida explains that All Might is with him alone.

   Both heroes knock on the door of the room, and Hawks asks All Might to talk to them as they want to know about the connection between Izuku Midoriya and the mysterious "One For All" that Tomura was so desperately trying to take over. All Might accepts his request, and after taking them to a more private area of the hospital, he decides to tell them everything.

   Three days later, as people continue to feel uneasy, Endeavor, Hawks, and Best Jeanist put on a press conference to address the public. In addition to confirming and clarifying many of the accusations that Dabi made about Endeavor and Hawks, the three are aware of the lack of trust towards the heroes, especially after Tomura raided numerous prisons to free the villains held there after escaping from the battle.

  <p key="12b84070-77b9-4e4f-9aa8-39716c5c0465">
   Best Jeanist adds that due to the significant amount of heroes resigning, it's become harder to protect the public so they have started a plan for help protecting the civilians, in which many of the heroic institutions are going to be used as evacuation shelters for civilians in need.

   Afterwards, Best Jeanist forms a team with Endeavor, Hawks, All Might and Izuku Midoriya in order to track down Tomura, All For One, and the remnants of the Paranormal Liberation Front, coming up with a plan to use Izuku as bait to lure them out. While All Might and Deku are handling other villains, Best Jeanist goes with Endeavor and Hawks to cover more ground and deal with rampant criminals.
  </p>
  <p key="4ffef82e-0e10-4ae0-8f12-636b63b08695">
   Some time later, Endeavor defeats and captures some robbers. After turning them over to the police, he meets with Hawks and Best Jeanist, with the latter assuming that the captured villains are escaped convicts but not affiliated with All For One, which Endeavor confirms.
  </p>
  <p key="7b5e8f9e-5e47-4969-9218-ad9b7a05c48d">
   The three are then approached by a mob of protesters, who insult them and accuse them of being responsible for the current situation for letting Tomura get away and releasing the prisoners. Best Jeanist has to use his Fiber Master Quirk to protect himself and his teammates from the objects that are thrown at them with contempt. The protesters continue to deride them as fakes as they drive away.

   While driving, Hawks receives a call from Edgeshot informing them that he hasn't made much progress in his investigation investigating the Paranormal Liberation Front. The three agree to give Izuku more space to prevent the press from finding out that he is the one the villains are looking for.

  <p key="1a0f9399-d738-40b2-a0b3-9f85aabe6158">
   The Heroes proceed to discuss what the villains' have planned next, assuming the Tartarus escapees had received some orders from All For One to capture Izuku. Best Jeanist says that with the heroes falling apart, if he was All For One, he would go on the offensive, but Endeavor doubts All For One is going to do that at the moment, as his main priority is to hijack Tomura's body once the maturation process is complete, so he can take the One For All from Izuku.
  </p>
  <p key="25dc1828-de05-4379-88ff-335483bd613b">
   Then Hawks admits he doesn't understand the reason of why Tomura's rage is so important to All For One in this process. Best Jeanist says that it takes a strong will to steal a Quirk bearing the will of eight other people, but Hawks replies that after hunting down OFA's successors for decades, All For One should have enough hatred. Best Jeanist believes maybe he doesn't have enough, but Hawks suggests he has none at all, since he is always seen smiling. Endeavor concludes that there may be something's missing in All For One's soul.
  </p>
  <p key="e5ab19cf-566c-4d72-b990-f7473df13ae9">
   Nevertheless, since the villains they have rounded up have no useful intel, they decide they may have to take the fight to the enemy and increase their search, even if it means reducing the number of people keeping peace on the street. Suddenly, Best Jeanist hears a notification that Izuku's GPS signal is gone.

Thankfully, Hawks flies in on the scene and catches Lady Nagant,
   while Endeavor follows behind. Before she passed out, Lady Nagant managed to reveal the location of All For One's supposed hideout in

   Some time later, Best Jeanist, Endeavor, Hawks, and the Lurkers meet privately in a warehouse, where they discuss how the search for All For One, Tomura, and their allies becomes more complicated as more heroes quit due to of not being able to withstand the pressure and criticism. Best Jeanist emphasizes that it has reached a point where any hero could snap anytime and it would not come as a shock.
  </p>
  <p key="84ab8526-08a9-4968-9edf-74d230f272ff">
   Endeavor adds that the retired heroes are leaking information regarding One For All, and the public are getting close to uncovering the truth about Izuku. At that moment they receive a message that Izuku has defeated another of the All For One agents, but later they discover that he has decided to continue the search alone.

   After several days wandering alone, defeating villains and helping civilians, Izuku is found by his classmates and convinced to return to the U.A. High School, but when he gets there there is a large group of people protesting, refugees who know that he is the rumored boy Tomura is looking for and reject his entry into the fortified U.A., as they fear that his presence will endanger them all.
   Best Jeanist tries to calm everyone down, saying it was him who proposed his return, which causes complaints from several protesters, since they are there because they trusted him.
  </p>
  <p key="6dddb107-b3a9-41a1-8093-3525642967fc">
   Best Jeanist explains that they wanted to take the fight to the enemy directly so they used Izuku to try and lure them out. Sadly, their search came up dry because they didn't have enough people. He admits Izuku is the villain's target, but he also considers him their best resource in battle and allowing him to grow even more tired will lead to more lives lost, which is why they are relying on this back up plan. He then pleads with the people to let Izuku stay so he can rejoin the battle in peak condition. The refugees, however, refuse to accept, protesting and complaining with even greater hostility towards the heroes and Izuku.
  </p>
  <p key="0d15487d-79ad-46fb-bb5a-144b2f27d353">
   At that moment, Ochaco takes a megaphone to address everyone.
   Best Jeanist, along with the rest of the heroes and students, listen to Ochaco's speech to the civilians, appealing to everyone to understand Izuku and let him rest in the U.A., reminding them that Izuku has been fighting all by himself for their sake, and now he, as well as the remaining heroes that are still fighting to protect them, needs their support. It works, as the people calm down and allow Izuku to go in.

   The next day, while Izuku rests, Best Jeanist goes out with Hawks again, while Endeavor flies close to them. While he is driving, the wing hero tells him tells him that thanks to the information obtained from Garaki's interrogation, the confessions of the captured All For One agents, and the research of the Nomus in Central Hospital, they still have at least a month to make their move and take the fight to All For One.

   With the death of Star and Stripe, the rest of the nations preferred not to send help to Japan to keep their homelands protected. The only positive thing about the battle is that, thanks to the data and records obtained by the pilots about "Tomura", he ended so badly injured that he will need another week to recover and complete his body.

   Despite this, the heroes devise a plan to use Yuga and his parents against All For One,
   in order to ambush him and separate him from Tomura Shigaraki so they can defeat them separately without being able to help each other.
   When everything is ready, like the rest of the heroes, Best Jeanist is informed of the plan with which to definitively defeat the villains.

   to trick All For One, the heroes manage to lure the villain into an abandoned city outside, falling for their trap. All For One uses his Warping Quirk to bring Tomura, the remaining Nomus and a lot of villains to the area, but then dozens of heroes appear through several Warp Gates, created by

   After a brief skirmish, the heroes activate a cages hidden beneath the battlefield, holding the villains long enough for Neito to summon several more Warp Gates around the cages,
   allowing the heroes to shove them all in, splitting up the villains into different parts of the country, separated from each other by hundreds of kilometres.

   As planned, the heroes send All For One, along with a few villains, to the ruins of the Gunga Mountain Villa, where he has to face Endeavor and a squad of Heroes. "Tomura", on the other hand, is warped alone to a now floating and enclosed U.A. High, where Best Jeanist and another hero team, consisting of Edgeshot, Mirko,

   However, an unforeseen event occurred during the struggle, and it was expected that Izuku would also be sent there to help in the fight, but Katsuki reports to Best Jeanist that Himiko managed to catch Izuku with one of her cables, causing him to be unintentionally warped to another place.
   Best Jeanist and other heroes are dismayed by this unforeseen event, but Mirko doesn't seem to care, saying that the only thing they have to do is going toe-to-toe with "Tomura".

  <p key="1bdb4f0e-7b8f-4b2d-b668-cdf7e0ed985f">
   Realizing that they are on some kind of floating island, "Tomura" decides to use his Decay on the ground to destroy it, but as soon as he does, a self-defense system activates, detaching the affected area and launching him into the electromagnetic barrier above. Not giving him time to recover, Best Jeanist causes several carbon fiber cables to wrap around Tomura's body to toss him back onto the battlefield, while telling Tomura that even with his modified body he can be momentarily stunned by such an electric shock.
  </p>
  <p key="bedc7054-a7c3-406b-b342-a7c05c8a654f">
   "Tomura" breaks free of the bonds, and mocks the heroe saying that even with such a defense system, sooner or later they will run out of ground. Best Jeanist points out that the detached area has already been replaced, assuring him that they have plenty of material to spare. Best Jeanist claims that the arena was specifically designed to defeat him and that they are there to end the threat he poses.
  </p>
  <p key="5ea9a6f0-779b-49b6-bdc1-ff3b52bf769c">
   "Tomura" then decides to destroy the barrier with a shockwave blast, but realizes that he cannot use any of his Quirks, as Monoma and Eraser Head are constantly using

   on him from a floating platform outside. Believing they have the upper hand, Best Jeanist's teammates pounce on "Tomura", but he takes them off-guard them by transforming his left arm into a monstrous blob of fingers.
   The heroes are shocked to see the grotesque swarm of fingers spreading further and further throughout the arena, destroying a part of it, and that the Erasure does not affect it at all. Best Jeanist tells his teammates to stay focused.
  </p>
  <p key="4038520e-468e-4edf-a8fb-16bfd25dde18">
   Izuku manages to communicate with them telling them that he was teleported to
   Okuto Island
   , and requests to be warped to where they are. However, Best Jeanist, as well as Edgeshot and Eraser Head, understand that this is not possible. Neito is unable to use two Quirks at once, and if he disables Erasure to use warp for even a few seconds, “Tomura” will be able to use Decay through each of his endlessly growing wave of fingers, finishing them all. With no other choice, they ask Izuku to get where they are on his own. Until then, Best Jeanist claims that they will strive to defeat “Tomura”, even without One For All.
