However, Chitose has taken countermeasures and used her Quirk to turn her subordinates' blood into explosives. This takes Himiko off guard, leaving her bloody and injured. Chitose demands to know why Himiko threw away a normal life after interviewing her old family and friends. Despite her injuries, Himiko responds with a bloody smile and says her life is perfectly normal as it is.

   Fascinated, Chitose affirms her belief that Himiko's life is the manifestation of a negligent society. Himiko collapses and Chitose goes over to comfort her, telling her that society pushed her into becoming a villain because Himiko's Quirk meant she could never be normal. Curious hopes to publish the tale of Himiko's story so she can be a martyr for Quirk liberation.

   All of the warriors in the area swarm together to destroy Tomura.

   Dabi decides it's time for him to seriously fight as well when suddenly a hooded warrior nearly crushes him using giant fists made of ice.
   Dabi is impressed that his assailant was able to sneak up on him and admits that growing stronger has helped him pick out tough opponents. The warrior clad in snow gear asks why the League's only wide-range attack has held back so far. He implies that perhaps something is wrong with Dabi's meta-ability. Dabi dispels this theory with a wave of flames that melts the warrior's footing.

Skeptic plans to draft Twice into the army so his Quirk can be put to great use for the Grand Commander.

   Twice doesn't understand why people looking like him are trying to kill Himiko. Skeptic draws out Twice's trauma thanks to information stolen from Giran. Twice frantically tries to save Himiko and the League he belongs to. Skeptic's puppets subdue him and snap his arms. Despite being in great pain, Twice is elated that he hasn't disappeared, proving once and for all he's not a Double.

Dabi refuses and tells Compress to seek aid from the Sad Man's Parade. Twice plans to double both his friends over and over to create a nation of villains. Compress warns him not to because they need fodder to weaken Gigantomachia when he arrives. The ice warrior annihilates a large chunk of Twice's army despite Dabi's fire.

   Confused, Dabi questions where this ice appeared from. Geten reveals he's been hiding the true power of his Quirk and froze nearby water to extend his powers. Geten believes a liberated future is one where one's social status is dictated by the strength of their Meta Ability. Irritated, Dabi believes that existence is pitiful and asks his opponent to die.

   Tomura and Spinner get closer to the tower, but there's even more resistance in that area. Warriors ambush both villains from all angles until the Sad Man's Parade reaches them.

Re-Destro makes the first move, destroying one of Twice's doubles with a single finger. He claims he'll kill Giran if he uses his Meta Ability again, but the doubles of Dabi and Compress attack.

   Re-Destro activates his Meta Ability and enlarges his arm. A single enhanced swing is enough to obliterate the lineup of doubles. Twice clones himself again before disappearing and goes to check on Giran. Re-Destro claims the League is foolish for opposing them and says they will crumble in the face of our will. Tomura's double survived the skirmish and saves the double of Twice. Re-Destro is excited to see Tomura face to face and tells him the story of the mother of Quirks.

Even with the reformation of Quirk laws and the rise of heroes, the suppression of someone's Meta Ability has gotten even more severe. Destro set out to create a world where this woman's child could express their power freely. Re-Destro asks how a petty gang of thugs who do nothing but destroy could ever match up to the history of liberation.

   Tomura only replies by asking Twice to cushion Giran's fall. He saw his true self outside, and he knows he's going to touch the tower. Tomura destroys the entire tower with a single touch. He faces off with Re-Destro in a hulking form and surmises he's the boss. The Detnerat CEO laments Tomura missing his question from earlier.

   The message doesn't come through clearly to the Grand Commander and he's distracted by Tomura's defensive instincts. Tomura managed to block his burden attack and the young man admits all he's capable of is destruction. Re-Destro says there can be no future in a destroyed world and prepares to end their fight.

   Even at 100% Stress, Tomura destroys Re-Destro's burden attacks with ease. Tomura starts comparing his desire for destruction to his enemy, causing the older man's powers to recede due to his stress suddenly reducing. Re-Destro can't come to terms with his feelings toward the newly crowned angel of death. He clads himself in his Claustro armor to revamp the power of his Meta Ability to 150%.

   With Deika reduced to ash, Gigantomachia watches in amazement. The decaying effect got to the Grand Commander's legs, so he was forced to cut both of them off. Tomura taunts him for starting this war and Trumpet's van arrives for reinforcements. Seeing that Tomura is the one truly worthy of Destro's legacy, Re-Destro calls off his forces and concedes the Meta Liberation Army to Tomura Shigaraki. Impressed, Gigantomachia finally accepts Tomura and admits he's a true successor.
