   . Crime rates were on the rise because citizens had no hero to believe in. This inspired the boy to become a powerful hero who could provide hope for innocents and defeat evil.

   During his teenage years, Toshinori met a pro-Hero named

   and explained his ideals to her. He told Nana that he wanted to create a world where everyone can smile and live happily together. For that to happen, the world needed a "Symbol of Peace" to inspire a new age of harmony. Toshinori believed he could become the pillar that inspires people everywhere.
   Nana believed the Quirkless boy and took him as her apprentice. She trained Toshinori and passed

   , served as his homeroom teacher and trained him. Toshinori's body was strong enough to utilize One For All at 100% from the start of training, so Gran Torino mainly focused on teaching Toshinori how to properly fight, although his training methods were so harsh that he accidentally instilling an innate fear within him.

   Inheriting One For All comes with the danger of facing All For One. Eventually,
   Toshinori, Nana and Gran Torino faced All For One
   , but the villain was too powerful. Nana sacrificed herself so that Toshinori could live on, entrusting his safety to Gran Torino. Toshinori could only watch as his master gave her life against All For One's supreme evil.

  <p key="b1c1cf30-83d4-456f-a343-28acca825689">
   As a promise to his close friend Nana, Gran Torino continued training Toshinori in her place. However, Toshinori was distraught after the death of his master and was unable to train to his potential. Thoughts of revenge plagued Toshinori's mind and he wished to avenge Nana, who he saw as a true hero. Gran Torino reminded Toshinori that his enemy is a man who's walked the earth for over a hundred years. Toshinori cried while saying his master gave up everything to raise One For All's next torchbearer and admits he thought of her as his own mother.
  </p>
  <p key="bc6ac63c-bc5f-4388-835c-ac36bc4d9969">
   Gran Torino recommended him to train in the United States after he graduated so All For One could not reach him and to gain experience as a hero. He reminded Toshinori why Nana sacrificed herself and restored his resolve. That spring, Toshinori graduated from U.A. and prepared to cross the ocean. Before he departed, Toshinori reminded himself of his master's trademark smile. He shaped his hair and donned what would become his own signature smile for the first time as All Might.

After thanking the reporters and journalists gathered there for their encouragement and congratulations, All Might retired behind the Might Gate to rest.

Just then, they received an emergency dispatch from Osaka after the Might Signal was activated.

The Symbol of Peace became the first torchbearer to defeat All For One, completely crushing his head and severely damaging the rest of his body. This was at the cost of critical injuries, as All Might's stomach was lost and his respiratory system was damaged beyond repair. This created a limit on how long All Might could use One For All, reducing his ability to be the Symbol of Peace.

Sir Nighteye threatened to stop helping should All Might continue his reign as the No. 1 Hero. He even uses his Foresight Quirk to warn All Might of his impending death. He told him that in six to seven years, he will confront a villain and head towards a gruesome death. All Might ignored Nighteye's warning and they dissolved their partnership completely.

   All Might prepares to leave, but the young fanboy holds on to All Might after he leaps high into the air. At first, All Might tries to shake him off but stops after agreeing that Izuku would die if he dropped him in mid-air. He is forced to land and tries to leave again, but Izuku questions him on whether he can become a hero without a Quirk. Before answering, All Might's time in his muscle form comes to an end and he reverts to his true form, shocking Izuku.

   All Might reveals to the surprised young man that he was injured in battle five years ago and can only stay in his hero form for a short time. He goes on to tell Izuku that professionals must always put their lives at stake to save the day and thus cannot openly say whether it is possible to be a Hero without a Quirk as it may not be possible. All Might says that if Izuku cares about saving people, he can always go on to become a policeman, as in that way he can be responsible for putting the villains in jail (even though it is often ridiculed). He tells Izuku that it is not bad to dream, but warns him not to obscure the facts and then leaves.

   Later on that same day, All Might appears before Izuku, thanking him and giving him a proposal. All Might tells Izuku that he was touched by his bravery for trying to save someone, despite not having a Quirk, and tells him that he too can become a hero.

   All Might reveals to Izuku that his Quirk can be passed down and that he has chosen Izuku to be the next one to inherit his Quirk. Izuku is shocked and asks why he would give someone like him his Quirk, to which All Might responds that he has been searching for a successor for a long time and now has found someone to whom he does not mind giving his Quirk, saying that despite not having a Quirk, Izuku tried to save Katsuki while other people and heroes stood idly by. Izuku accepts All Might's proposal and they begin training for the next ten months, explaining to him that in order for him to inherit his Quirk, Izuku's body (vessel) must be strengthened to the point of being able to handle the One For All's power.

   After taking the decision to train Izuku to be the new One For All's successor, Toshinori phones Nighteye to tell him this, but Nighteye is vehemently against the idea of a Quirkless middle schooler becoming his successor. Toshinori and Nighteye argue over the phone regarding Izuku; Toshinori argues that Izuku was intent on saving others while Nighteye argues that intentions alone were not good enough since there are far more capable candidates with the same good will as Izuku. However, Toshinori states that being Quirkless is what made Izuku a befitting candidate over the others. This argument would result in All Might and Sir Nighteye falling out and no longer being on speaking terms as a result.

   All Might trains Izuku at the
   Takoba Municipal Beach Park
   , a coastline that has been filled with trash. He has Izuku clean up all the trash as part of training his body to become strong enough to withstand the power of his Quirk, otherwise, it can result in Izuku losing limbs. After 10 months have passed, Izuku surprises All Might by cleaning the whole beach and becomes a genuine vessel. Amazed by his feat, All Might rewards Izuku for his hard work by having Izuku consume a piece of his hair, enough DNA to transfer One For All to Izuku.

   All Might approaches Shota, calling him a liar and says that he saw that he once expelled an entire new class of first-graders last year. All Might knows that he kicks students out with zero chances, finding it weird that he did not expel Izuku on the spot and concludes to him that even he felt Izuku's raw potential.

He explains that in the Battle Trial, the villains will guard a nuclear weapon they intend on deploying and the heroes must stop them. He goes on to further say that the heroes can win by capturing the villains or reach the nuclear bomb before time runs out and the villains can win by capturing the heroes or keeping the core away from the heroes before time runs out.

   All Might then decides that the teammates and pairs will be chosen by lottery. After the lottery, All Might draws from the boxes and says that the pairs that will do battle are the

He tells them to go all out as it is a practical exercise, although he says that he will stop the Battle Trial if things get out of hand.

   After the lunch break begins, All Might in his hero form greets Enji, saying it's been a while and asks him to have tea with him.
   All Might says that they have not spoken to each other in ten years and that he wanted to give him a shout out, Enji replies that he can take his tea offer to some other place and tells him to go away. As Enji leaves, All Might stops him, saying that his son Shoto was able to show a great performance even without using half of his power. All Might then asks Enji for advice on how to raise the next generation. Enji comments on All Might's attitude, finding it to be annoying and then says that he will make Shoto a hero that surpasses All Might, then angrily walks away.

   All Might goes to see Izuku before the beginning of his match. After Izuku says that he can raise his strength only a little with One For All, All Might says that originally, on a scale of one to a hundred, the amount of strength Izuku's body could tolerate it was zero, but now it is a five. When Izuku starts frowning, All Might cheered him up; telling him to do his best and encourages him to smile when he is full of fear and anxiety. All Might then concludes that he is always watching Izuku.

All Might theorizes that the people he saw were imprints of those who have used One For All but not the sort who have a will on their own and concludes that Izuku broke Hitoshi's spell, not because of the predecessors of One For All but because his unwilling of willpower caused the vision to appear that broke Hitoshi's brainwash.

   The tournament continues until it is Izuku's turn again. During the match between Izuku and Shoto, All Might watches on, worried about his student's health. After Izuku states to Shoto that becoming Number One without his full strength as well as to disown someone is a joke, All Might remembers Endeavor's words of making his son surpass him. Soon after remembering, All Might theorizes to himself that Shoto won't use his firepower due to the discord between him and his father. He then tries to figure out what Izuku is trying to do. After Shoto activates his firepower, All Might concludes that Izuku is trying to save Shoto from his cruel fate, despite wanting to win. All Might notes that Izuku is going out of his way to help his opponent, causing him to wonder which of them is the joke.

   After school that day, All Might appears in front of Izuku as he is about to leave class. All Might and Izuku walk along the corridor. All Might says that Izuku received a nomination, much to Izuku's surprise. All Might tells Izuku that the person who nominated him was Gran Torino. All Might explains that Gran Torino was a Pro Hero who taught at U.A. for one year and that Gran Torino was his homeroom teacher. All Might says that Gran Torino was a close friend of his predecessor, but now he is in retirement. All Might says that Gran Torino knows about the One For All Quirk which is the reason why he must have nominated Izuku.

Naomasa explains that the DNA analysis also revealed that Nomu has the DNA of at least four different humans mixed with his own. Naomasa concludes that Nomu is an artificial human-made to measure up to multiple Quirks and that having all the DNA in his body as well as his body modified caused Nomu's brain activity to stop.

Naomasa comes to the conclusion that someone with a Quirk that can grant Quirks is behind Nomu's acquisition of multiple Quirks. All Might becomes concerned as he fears that All For One has returned.

Gran Torino says that if Stain's backstory is revealed to the public through the use of media, villainy will rise and the League of Villains will take credit as a group following Stain's ideology due to the connection between them, which will cause delinquents to join the League of Villains.

   All Might meets with Izuku in the Break Room.

All Might says that Izuku's blood was ingested by the Hero Killer, reminding Izuku about One For All transfer and inheritance method, causing Izuku to panic (thinking that One For All is in Stain's possession). However, All Might tells Izuku that he still has One For All because One For All will not be transferred to a new recipient unless the user wishes it, thus One For All cannot be forcibly stolen, although it can be forcibly passed on. All Might tells Izuku that One For All is a special Quirk and begins telling Izuku One For All's origin. All Might says that One For All is derived from a Quirk that has existed since the beginning.

   All Might says that long ago during the Quirk phenomenon, society had not adapted to the idea of having Quirks which caused an age of upheaval to arise; a man possessing a Quirk called

   (a Quirk that can steal Quirks and grant them) stole many Quirks and used his new overwhelming power and influence to gather and unify people under his command. The man used the people he gathered as pawns for his plans which allowed to take over Japan and made himself its evil ruler. Izuku says that he has heard rumors but this story is not in any textbook causing All Might to reply that underground dealings are never recorded in the textbooks.
  </p>
  <p key="e9414d6d-c49b-4a08-af00-9ee034fe40be">
   Izuku asks how this man is related to One For All. All Might says that All For One can grant Quirks, but those who were not able to handle the strain became brain-dead like Nomu. All Might explains that there were cases for those who did survive the procedure where their Quirks mutated. All Might tells Izuku another story; the man (who would eventually become Japan's evil ruler) had a younger brother; the man used All For One and forcibly gave his younger brother a Quirk that stockpiles power. However, the younger brother already had a Quirk, a Quirk that can transfer itself to others. The younger brother's Quirks (one that stockpiles power and the other that can transfer itself) merged and became One For All.

  <p key="099d8f33-133d-45c5-ba90-6f9984849d9b">
   All Might notes the irony that justice was born in the bowels of evil. Izuku says that it is impossible for the man who ruled Japan in the distant past to be alive. All Might theorizes that the man stole a Quirk that stopped his aging or a Quirk that granted him immortality. All Might explains that the younger brother, whose Quirks became One For All, fought against his older evil brother but could not defeat him.

  <p key="fa495475-5632-4346-9c3b-954403cf2d6c">
   The younger brother decided to pass on One For All to the next generation so that one day it will accumulate enough power to defeat the older brother's All For One; All Might says that he was finally the successor that defeated the older brother, or so he thought. All Might tells Izuku that the man possessing All For One has returned and is leading the League of Villains. All Might finishes his story by saying that One For All is a power that is meant to stop All For One and that Izuku will also have to confront the man.

  <p key="094842cf-4cf7-4585-bc15-618f8e48533c">

   Weeks go by, and shortly after winter begins, Class 1-A is sent to Nabu Island, a remote place in southern Japan. As the Class 1-A members are helping around the island, at U.A. High School All Might worries about whether they will be okay. Shota assures Toshinori that he should not be concerned, as Nabu Island is a quiet place where there have been no incidents involving villains in the past thirty years, and the students should be relatively safe from any significant threats.
  </p>
  <p key="71a37511-2758-4944-b1fc-4dd737c67b6a">
   Unfortunately, the island is attacked by the villain Nine and his gang, although the students managed to defeat them and send a S.O.S. Shortly after Class-1-A emerged victorious over the threat, a field force of professional heroes and the military arrived on Nabu Island. Toshinori helps the wounded Izuku and Katsuki, who had barely managed to defeat Nine. A barely conscious Izuku tearfully apologizes to Toshinori for giving One For All to Katsuki because he had no other choice if he wanted to protect the people on the island before losing consciousness.

   Toshinori forgives Izuku, but is left surprised when he sees One For All still retained inside of Izuku. At first, he theorized that Katsuki must've lost consciousness before the transfer could be completed, but then theorized that One For All must've kept itself inside of Izuku for his willingness to risk himself to protect the innocent even if it means losing One For All. Tearfully, Toshinori thanks the previous users of One For All and his master, Nana Shimura.

   At the end of December, Toshinori appears more skeletal than usual because he hasn't slept in a few days, collecting all the information he could find about the previous One For All inheritors and their Quirks to help Izuku. Nezu visits him to inform him that the next round of work studies will begin soon.
  </p>
  <p key="8ae4bda6-e86b-4f1d-a923-ac91e256905f">
   A few days later, Nezu talks to All Might and detective Naomasa through a video call. They talk about the fact that since all the students moved into Heights Alliance four months ago, they have been being watched to discover the League's spy, but in all that time no one has shown signs of being the spy, so it seems that the traitor is not one of them. All Might tells Nezu that all students of the Hero course are true heroes and none of them is the traitor, to which Nezu replies he knows that. Then, Nezu asks All Might if he will return to the U.A. that day. All Might tells him that it is unlikely since he is very busy unless something happens to Izuku. Nezu reassures him by telling him that he apparently has forgotten that it is Christmas.

   with Endeavor. Toshinori thinks it's an excellent idea. When Izuku asks him about his training with the One For All, he replies that there should be no problems because as long he has mastered the image of "locking" and "unlocking", All Might he doesn't expect that he will experience more outbursts. As for Katsuki, All Might tells him that it will benefit him to work with Endeavor since both are very similar.

   All Might and the WHA Director organize a worldwide operation with heroes from all over the world to attack the 25 headquarters that Humarise has in different countries. Since the nature of the entire operation is strictly off-books clandestine, they must refrain from asking for help from local law enforcement.
  </p>
  <p key="72210e6f-8a6f-4b9e-9de1-a6ce6ff6ce38">
   Once the operation begins, the heroes around the globe successfully raid the Humarise branches in each of the countries, but they fail to locate the Trigger Bombs or apprehend the leader. All Might theorizes that Humarise has another base of operations that they missed, tellings his suspicions to the WHA Director, who orders the heroes deployed to the branches to be on standby.

  <p key="ce0d3885-ce3b-48fd-a9e4-f036cdfb113e">
   Some time later, while he continues to help by advising them to coordinate the operation, the World Heroes Association receives an emergency call from Otheon task force, informing them of a shocking event: Izuku Midoriya has been accused of a mass murder of twelve people by the Otheon government, placing him on the most wanted list. Toshinori is totally appalled of the accusations against his pupil and successor, being unable to believe them, and distraught at being unable to do anything about it.
  </p>
  <p key="4a661798-98f2-4136-a0da-1f53055d6ad6">
   A few days later, the operation is compromised when Flect Turn hacked into every communications network and broadcast to the world that they have planted Trigger Bombs in the major cities of the twenty-five countries and they will detonate them in two hours. One of the WHA workers wonders if this might be a trap, and Toshinori replies that even if it is, they still have to do something about it, as Humarise's ultimatum results in widespread panic and hysteria throughout the countries. The WHA greenlights the heroes being deployed to each sector and fights in defense to quell the chaos and locate the Trigger Bombs.
  </p>
  <p key="663211f0-25c6-4dc4-b826-13d66d984a8c">
   When there's only less than 30 minutes left before the detonations, the WHA receives a message from Shoto Todoroki, who tells them that he, Izuku, and Katsuki had obtained a disarming key for the Trigger Bombs, and that they are now heading to Humarise's secret base, where the main system of the deadly weapons is. Since at that moment all the heroes are busy facing Humarise's soldiers, none can be sent to support them, so the only thing Toshinori can do is wish the three students luck in their mission.

  <p key="b7ce1fc0-14e3-43fc-a9f6-d696211bb5b9">
   For several intense minutes, all he can do is watch the heroes fighting relentlessly to remove the Trigger Bombs, while the countdown continues. Fortunately, when the count reaches the deadline, none of the Trigger Bombs blow up, indicating that Izuku's group succeeded in disarming the bombs worldwide. The workers in the WHA control room celebrate that the tragedy has been averted, and Toshinori congratulates everyone for it. With the crisis over, Toshinori returns to U.A. High School, congratulating Izuku for his valiant job to accomplish the mission.

   Winter break ends and students return to the U.A. High School. Class 1-A head to Ground Alpha to show how much they have improved with their skills and Quirks during the Hero Work-Studies. Because Shota Aizawa has to attend an emergency, Toshinori replaces him. He welcomes Class 1-A students at Ground Alpha, making cotton candy to make a joke on his catchphrase, which doesn't win over the students.

   Class 1-A begins the training, battling Villain bots to showcasing their newfound abilities. Finally, it's Katsuki and Izuku's turn to show off what they learned working for Endeavor at his agency. Toshinori is especially glad about Izuku showing his improved control over Blackwhip. All Might recalls some of his interactions with him, holding back tears, but proudly looking on as he realizes that Izuku no longer needs his approval, as he's outgrown the need for it. All Might concludes the class, revealing that everything was recorded for Shota Aizawa to watch later, and encourages the students to keep working hard at their work studies.

   Later, in the Teachers Lounge, All Might meets with Izuku and Katsuki, congratulating the two on their improvements, much to Izuku's delight and Katsuki's annoyance. All Might then places a notebook on the table that contains his research into the Quirks of the past successors of One For All.
   He reveals he couldn't find anything on the 2nd and 3rd users due to the era they existed in and the multifaceted nature of the Quirk. All Might asks Izuku if he made contact with the other users, to which he says no.

   During the conversation about the previous heirs, Toshinori reveals that they were heroes who did not have particularly powerful Quirks, as All For One hunted down the strongest. Also, the concept of a "One for All successor" was not implemented until Nana Shimura chose him. Until then, the heirs fought All For One and got themselves killed for it at relatively young ages, and they simply entrusted One for All to their closest ally to keep fighting, until one day the Quirk grow powerful enough to defeat All for One. Katsuki then asks what the next Quirk Izuku will get, to which Toshinori says it'll be Nana's Quirk, which is called Float.

   At night, he is sitting outside Heights Alliance, when Shota approaches him and asking him what he's doing, to which All Might says he isn't doing much. He asks about Eri to which Shota tells him she's asleep and he'll start training her this week. All Might offers his help, to which Shota appreciates. He then asks what's bothering All Might, to which he says that while he has decided to live, he can't help but feel powerless when he sees how much they've developed.

  <p key="0bff2dc2-e8e1-4e90-ae7e-f5305ee6982d">
   Shota tells him that because he bore the title of Symbol of Peace for so long, it's hard for him to accept that there are so many other things he can do for the students, such as being there for them, and to keep being the person he knows he is. All Might accepts the advice while asking what Shota wanted, to which he tells him that Naomasa sent a message to him asking for him to delay his meeting with Stain.

   Toshinori continues to take care of Deku until Hawks and Best Jeanist arrive and ask to speak to him.

Hawks surmises he is worried about putting anyone else's lives in danger, adding that while they could potentially keep him completely isolated to prepare for what is to come, knowing the capacity of power the ones who attacked Tartarus possess, it will be all over if they come well prepared.

Now, they all will fight for what they love together. He relays the new information that Stain has given him to the Heroes and Naomasa about Tomura and AFO.

   All Might meet with Naomasa who reveals that since Tartarus’ systems are cut off from the outside world, they would’ve had no way of getting this data normally, and that it contains the cause of the system shutdown, which was “Tomura” and All For One’s constant blasts of
   Radio Waves
   inside and out.

  <p key="4c454194-9e8c-4d25-9079-f11c0fbdd4aa">
   Sansa suggests that this is because All For One was synchronized with the vestige within Tomura, however All Might reveals that the communication isn’t a two-way channel. Just like with his vestige within OFA, while the vestige has access to all his current thoughts, All Might himself has no connection to the vestige itself, at least until he was able to make contact with Izuku back at the Hospital. Because of this, All Might believes that even All For One wouldn’t be able to have such direct control over the vestige from so far away.

   Central Hospital
   ’s research stated it was 2 months till he was completed, but All Might says it’s possible he rigged the results as a bluff, and that if they are to take their conversation as the truth, Tomura will be complete in 3 days.

Although All Might was currently at U.A, it wasn't until the American jet fighter pilots returned to tell him her death. He was lamented with sadness about wanting to see her again. However, the pilots tell him their fighter jets have a record of the battle, and were able to measure all of Tomura's bio-signatures, as well as every Quirk during the fight, providing the data to them to use, alongside the ones already being studied at

   He reminds them of their current targets: Tomura, All For One in his original body, Dabi, Himiko Toga, the remaining six Near High-End Nomu, the remnants of the Paranormal Liberation Front, and the remaining escaped convicts, also including that they’ll be likely to amass more allies too. All Might continues that while less than half of their heroes remain, it is thanks to Star’s sacrifice that they have a chance to use this time for everyone to grow even a little bit stronger.

   , they’ve continued their training with the Wild, Wild Pussycats, all with the intention to fight alongside Izuku until Tomura is defeated. The rest of the class each respond with enthusiasm as they all prepare to go out and train. All Might watches on, thinking about how the “zygotes” from the first day of class have hatched brilliantly into fledgling heroes. He thinks about how All For One has made a foolish mistake underestimating them, and that Class 1-A is a mighty force to behold.

  <p key="752bfb08-f548-4188-8c6f-74160724876f">
   After interrogating them on information regarding All For One, Izuku speaks up as he recognized Yuga's troublesome situation and had no malicious intentions in his actions, so wants him to help them and prove he can still be a hero. The rest of the class believes this as meaning they can use Yuga to deceive All For One, but Naomasa reminds them that it is still very unlikely that could work. Just then, Shota Aizawa, listening in on a tablet, informs everyone that he has an idea, which they all listen to after covering the Aoyama Family's ears. Nezu says that it seems possible, and All Might adds that it'll be up to how well "he" can handle it, as Naomasa escorts the Aoyama Family back to their HQ, telling everyone not to say a word to anyone else about the plan.

   All Might demonstrates their scenario by placing tiny refrigerator buttons of the villains on a whiteboard, stating that whether they’re going for Plan A or B, what they must do no matter what is to split them up. He further elaborates that the only way they can hope to achieve total victory is by isolating all of the villains that are deemed a major threat: separating each of the League's major operatives, luring them out individually, and defeating them one by one.

   Several men say it’s easier said than done, with All Might responding they need to have a strategy to make it happen, which Naomasa figures is Yuga. He adds that while he does sympathize with his situation, considering he still turned his back on society, from his position he still has to proceed with caution. All Might chooses to believe in Yuga, and he already believes in his teacher, Shota.

   After the conclusion of the meeting, All Might, Naomasa, and Nezu visit Class 1-A to explain the plans to deceive All For One. They remind them how unlikely it is they’ll be able to track them down in their search, however, this works to their benefit as it allows them to draw him out by getting him to loosen up. Naomasa explains how they assume that All For One is using Search to monitor everyone, and everything they’ve done since Izuku returned will make him believe that they’re being exhausted, which will allow them to catch him off guard, and utilize Shota's plan of having Yuga choose the location to lure him out.

   Theorizing that All For One has a way of determining whether people are lying or not, in order for the plan to take effect, All Might has recruited Hitoshi Shinso, to the class’ excitement. Hitoshi explains that he had to train hard to keep up with everyone, so managed to push through the limits of his Quirk to allow him to get his brainwashed targets to talk, so their plan is to make Yuga and his parents talk so that their motives and emotions won’t come into play at all.

   Sometime later, he watches as Hitoshi brainwashes the Aoyama Family as they are in contact with All For One, giving him Yuga's number, followed by a brainwashed Yuga giving All For One their meet-up location, a parking lot on the outskirts of the U.A. "Troy" dormitory.

   When the day finally arrives, All Might and the Counter-Force observe from Central Hospital, waiting patiently for Izuku to make contact with Yuga who was recently released from his "lawyers", anticipating All For One to finally reveal himself after months of hiding without a single trace. With One For All in his reach, All For One summons an army of villains, intending to end it all here so he can get One For All, using Search to confirm none of the Heroes are anywhere near.

   However, it turns out the other part of their plan to catch him off guard was to utilize Neito Monoma to Copy Kurogiri's Warp Gate, allowing them to teleport the heroes immediately onto the battlefield. Now that all the villains have been summoned in one place, All Might activates the Troy system, trapping all the villains in cages emerging from beneath the battlefield. All Might and Naomasa declare that even though they tried to bring him down once before and All Might's stomach was destroyed, they're still alive, and this time for sure they’ll take him down. Neito summons several more Warp Gates around the cages, as the Heroes prepare to shove them all in, to split up the villains.
