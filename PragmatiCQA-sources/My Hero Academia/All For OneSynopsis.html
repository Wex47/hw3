The older brother read only to Volume 3 of the series, but stopped because he didn't like the cliched ending between "Hero" and "Villain". Since then, he dreamt of being a demon king and creating the world just like the comics.

Using his incredible might, the man gathered and unified thousands of people under his command. He then manipulated the people he gathered like pawns to further his plans and eventually became Japan's ruler.

   He also started grooming other powerful individuals who he deemed to have a lot of potential, such as

   All For One was accused of atrocity for his actions by his younger brother, Yoichi. All For One claimed that he was only helping people by taking away undesirable Quirks and giving power to the weak; thus contributing to restore humanity in a chaotic era. However, Yoichi criticised his brother for using subtle schemes to gather followers and disposing them after they had become worthless.

   When All For One visited his captive brother, he saw how emaciated he had become. He tells Yoichi about how a group who refused to join him were killed, simply because his followers interpreted his desires as instructions to kill them. Yoichi was disgusted and voiced his defiance against his brother. Insulted, All For One then used his Quirk to foist a power stockpiling Quirk on Yoichi in order to make him submit to him as well as to make him more powerful.
   What no one knew at the time is that Yoichi already had an innate Quirk which could only be transferred to others. The two Quirks merged to form a new Quirk:

   ", according to which someday Quirks will become so powerful that they will be uncontrollable, but society scoffed at this theory, so he disappeared from the public eye.
   However, possibly due to the nature of his own Quirk, All For One believed his theory and lent Kyudai his aid.
   Since then, Kyudai has been working for All For One. As a gift of loyalty and appreciation, Kyudai duplicated his

   Kyudai questioned whether All For One should modify Tenko. All For One replied no, and that he would teach him how to take his feelings and frustrations, and give them purpose.
   All For One told Tenko that he had an impulse to destroy that couldn't be controlled. He assured him that the impulse didn't have to be controlled, nor was it necessarily a bad thing.

  <p key="2be4aae2-a277-4fcf-a6d7-6a2ee0ae3b50">
   One day, Tenko got into a fight with two punks. He was going to fight back and uses the Decay on them but backed down. Later, he threw a tantrum while All For One tried to console the young Tenko, telling him that he should act as his heart commands, otherwise he would suffer for it. He explained that conscience, morals, and ethics were all fabrications, intended to restrain people like them. He asked Tenko one more time what he would like to do. Tenko replied that he wanted to kill the two street thugs, noting that he couldn't hold back his feelings anymore. He disintegrated one of the hands, and All For One smiled, and told him to try his best.

   On a rooftop nearby, All For One and Kyudai watched Tenko murdering the street punks. Garaki expressed surprise at the events, saying he thought that Tenko had lost his memories. All For One corrected him, noting that the memories were still there, just shut away. He noted that his family's hands would serve to restrain him, keeping all but his negative emotions suppressed. He saw that Tenko is subconsciously keeping his Quirk in check. Smiling, All For One expressed pride in seeing Tenko's first step down the path to becoming the Symbol of Fear, and said that he will cultivate and encourage him on the journey.

   Later, All For One awarded Tomura five new dissected hands. Four belong to the two thugs he killed, and he explains that the fifth hand is a small bonus to make up for the one he destroyed earlier. He asked Tenko to put on all the new hands, and rechristened him "Tomura Shigaraki" as Tomura means "to mourn" and Shigaraki is his own surname. After this, All For One began grooming Tomura as his successor and as the new Symbol of Fear, knowing that this growing raw hatred of his could be used to finally steal One For All. All For One was also aware that Tomura was suppressing his memories and his Quirk.

However, the unexpected intervention of Rumi, who returned to help fight the Hooded Man, spoiling the plan, Which leaves him frustrated and displeased. With All Might closing in, Kurogiri uses his Quirk to quickly retrieve the Hooded Man.

  </p>
  <p key="f95fd444-1926-4abd-b72a-51b3b356e276">
   Number 6 is temporarily restrained by the Police, but he uses his transformative abilities to slip out of his cuffs. "O'Clock" warns him about watching out for Soga, and then once Koichi starts blasting at him with rapid spots, "O'Clock" points out how annoying they are to deal with, so recommends retreating so he doesn't out of breath, which Number 6 reluctantly does. Reconvening outside, Number 6 spots Koichi blasting off into the sky, causing "O'Clock" to realize he is leaving to summon All Might, warning him that they'll only have about 60 seconds until he arrives.
  </p>
  <p key="57969bb9-9c6b-4e9c-93e7-84e1919f5ba3">
   Despite this, "O'Clock" is confident in Number 6's abilities, since in that time he can easily sneak into the hospital, eliminate Kazuho, and escape, embracing his anonymity. Number 6, however, disagrees with this notion, as doing so would only leave him as "nameless" and "faceless" as ever, so decides to indulge himself and massacre everyone, just as Koichi returns right behind him.
  </p>
  <p key="2cf3be0a-7ffb-40fb-b0dd-0e5a45d9bf4e">
   After talking between each other, the two begin to fight, with Number 6 catching Koichi off guard and seemingly destroying him with a
   Knuckle Bomb
   punch. However to his surprise, Koichi emerges from the explosion relatively fine, with "O'Clock" reminding Number 6 there must be an unknown factor at play and to observe in detail rather than using back in to attack. They realize that Koichi had been using his

    Slide and Glide
   </a>
   Quirk to repel the explosions, and recognizing his speed, maneuverability, and flight, "O'Clock" suggests a hasty retreat. Number 6 irritatingly refuses this warning and begins to give chase with the vigilante.
  </p>
  <p key="69200c80-7237-4534-9756-35ab175659af">
   As Koichi continues to dodge each of Number 6's attacks, "O'Clock" surmises that he had managed to lure Number 6 away from the hopsital, and still intends on seeking All Might's help, with Number 6 taking the bait, something he is painfully aware of already.
   Number 6 confronts Koichi about how he is able to match his every movement, which he is unable to properly answer, causing "O'Clock" to note how he isn’t playing dumb, meaning that he must be handling the Overclock attacks subconsciously.
  </p>
  <p key="4dba3588-ec73-49fb-a179-0aca1a72ec08">
   Equating Koichi’s luckiness to “button-mashing”, Number 6 decides to go in for a rush attack, blasting Koichi with a flurry of punches, which he attempts to reflect. “O’Clock” informs him that his “quantity over quality” tactic is ill-advised, as the essence of Overclock is acceleration of one’s thought process, which allows them to deliberately choose the optimal action every time, but without strength akin to All Might, a head-on approach won’t be effective.
  </p>
  <p key="0d3b6a7a-4bdf-482d-8e3a-de84d8decd3c">
   Number 6 ignores this advice and continues the assault, but Koichi is unable to block and deflect every single attack. Bewildered by how he's managed to match Overclock’s speed, “O’Clock” figures out what is going on. He talks about how the human body will often take action without waiting for a conscious decision to be made, and that Koichi’s subconscious actions follow this line of thought. He continues that while Number 6’s brain can process thoughts faster than anyone, Koichi’s body can act even faster than his thoughts.
  </p>
  <p key="b7aff979-4662-484d-9687-8c31a453df76">
   “O’Clock” suggests Number 6 abandon the mission and retreat, while also stressing not to encounter Koichi again. He states that with his superior Quirk, which grants him high-speed movement, ranged attacks, and defensive force fields, as well as the subconscious reflexes to trigger them all when needed, while he may only be able to flee and dodge currently, in the days to come if he perfects his abilities, he will become the perfect foil, a foe like All Might to be avoided. Number 6, however, angrily rejects this statement, declaring executing Koichi to now be the only thing that matters to him, transforming into a giant spider-like creature known as the
   Hi-Crawler
   .
  </p>
  <p key="18f294e4-e636-4a15-aabe-54590bbd4fc6">
   Thanks to the modifications on his body, the Hi-Crawler form allows Number 6 to utilize Overclock indefinitely, allowing him finally the opportunity to overwhelm Koichi. Yet despite this, "O'Clock" advises him against his tactics, as thanks to Koichi's years as a vigilante, unlike most Pros, he has always been on the defensive side, meaning that he has developed a “flight or fight” response to any fight: a “variant fighter”, trained to counter any attack.
  </p>
  <p key="6982ea76-ac3e-463e-b445-49a0f4b7dfe8">
   "O'Clock" tells him he's too focused on mimicking O'Clock's fighting style and needs to come up with another plan to catch Koichi off guard. Their plan is to distract Koichi for long enough to be harassed by the mob of remaining Anonymous, using his control with Overclock to overwhelm him on all sides. All For One then starts to think to himself that changing targets has come at a considerable cost, and while he considers the mission a failure, the experiment has taken an intriguing turn, gleefully telling Number 6 to follow his twisted path, seek his culmination, and surpass his every limit.
  </p>
  <p key="e0069619-3e23-4811-9a93-dcf37842aa79">
   He attempts to

   at Koichi from afar, but is attacked by Knuckleduster, the real O'Clock, and through their skirmish, Koichi ends up blasting him and Number 6 in the sky, before the villain once again changes tactics.
   Combusting the Bomber cells within his body into plasma energy, Number 6 transforms into his
   Lightning Style
   form, granting him the power of flight.
  </p>
  <p key="dcf0823f-f1a0-4083-aeb2-489e9a03ec3c">
   Finally shedding his O'Clock disguise, All For One is surprised by Number 6's action, praising how his admiration for heroes has set him on his path, and his rage has allowed him to maximize his potential, no longer operating to his whims, but taking flight on his own free will; the greatest guinea pig he could ask for.
  </p>
  <p key="5095ec43-8ffd-4416-ab5c-711ffb3fbaee">
   With how much the fight has escalated, All For One criticizes Number 6 for how bombastic it has gotten, calling Operation Anonymous a total failure, and telling him to move on to the retrieval phase. However, Number 6 disagrees, as all he wants and needs to do is kill Koichi with all the strength he can muster: his sole desire left.
  </p>
  <p key="1abb16a1-69fb-4594-b81b-4604ca0e03bd">
   All For One gleefully lets Number 6 show him how brightly his existence can burn. All For One gleefully watches on Number 6 proceeds to fuse together himself with all the remaining Bomber cells of the Anonymous, witnessing his final shining act, the powerful incarnation he’s long desired.
  </p>
  <p key="b5228393-ab18-444c-92c0-6e355af8ec40">
   Transforming into the form known as
   Destruction Style
   , All For One looks on at the “portrait of hell” as he witnesses the Anonymous and their Bomber cells combusting, transferring all their power to Number 6, as All For One asks if this is his concept of a “true hero.” Transformed into a gigantic flaming humanoid, Number 6 violently attacks Koichi, managing to seriously injure him, forcing the young vigilante to escape.
  </p>
  <p key="81512765-f64d-41a0-92e2-ffe611ae28ff">
   After Koichi escapes into a building to hide from the now giant Number 6, All For One reminds him that his target is a “master of hide-and-seek” and he’ll be trickier to hit underneath the building, asking what his next move is. Seeing his decision to destroy the building into nothing, All For One gleefully states that he’s reached the conclusion just like his "old chum", smashing everything to dust with overwhelming violence.
  </p>
  <p key="6efa7467-ed9d-4414-8901-dd9df07c2dbc">
   All For One gleefully watches as an enraged Number 6 endlessly bangs on the rubble of the building Koichi was hiding in, all to ensure that he is dead, when there is a sudden explosion and Koichi emerges from the debris, apparently without too major wounds and ready to face Number 6 one more time.
  </p>
  <p key="2ce3efb9-7bc3-43f2-b7b6-9a646d56ee6c">
   As soon as he sees that he is still alive, Number 6 attacks Koichi, who dodges his blows until he can finally fight back with the new technique he has developed:
   Knuckle Style
   , piercing Number 6's body.
   The villain regenerates his wound, but Koichi continues to use his new technique to constantly attack him, ripping his body apart each time. Although Number 6 regenerates or reattaches the missing parts, Koichi keeps the villain at bay until help can arrive.
  </p>
  <p key="7fbe9506-af9e-4094-9101-950488876aa7">
   Seeing such skill, All For One begins to observe Koichi, examining how his Slide and Glide Quirk is a simple one with force fields that can repulse or absorb in someway, remarking on his relative mastery of the Quirk, while also noting the Quirk itself is the “height of mediocrity”. He notes that the occasional high-output bursts are fleeting, that he runs out of steam shortly afterward, and that it’s simply just polished use of a Quirk that lacks any decisive power... at least that’s what he thought.
  </p>
  <p key="aad63363-7fd6-4bd4-a720-830ccd42c993">
   Noticing the extremely powerful punches Koichi has started to execute with his Quirk, All For One reflects on how it is far more than should be possible, likely drawing from a source of passion which he’s imbuing his fists with. He thinks about how his Quirk has begun to reveal its true potential, wondering if he was disguising it as a weak Quirk the whole time, or if his trial has triggered explosive growth, asking him what drives him and what obsession spurred him to evolve.
  </p>
  <p key="c8a4711d-5401-46f8-b8e4-32f5b2871a0c">
   Number 6 seemingly manages to put an end to Koichi, with All For One congratulating him, while lamenting no body means no sample to retrieve. Despite that, he considers it as a whole to be a worthwhile experiment, discovering Koichi’s latent potential, even though it couldn’t best Number 6’s tenacity. He congratulates him on his victory, and even though he’ll soon lose control of the combustion process and burn away to nothing, he’s shone a glorious light on his future. However, they are both further shocked to discover Koichi still alive and kicking, as their battle resumes.
  </p>
  <p key="c332051a-5228-4fbf-b4b5-7e0d3d3f07fa">
   All For One observes their fighting, calling it akin to “frolicking” within their exchange of passionate blows. He wonders where all their energy is coming from and what their Quirks are tapping into, as it’s nothing he can comprehend. He is desperate to know how to reach this domain “beyond the singularity”, when he hears “Knuckleduster” behind him, telling that a collector such as him would never understand. All For One turns around to see who spoke to him, but he doesn't see anyone.
  </p>
  <p key="e6ccf11e-c700-44c3-833a-cf0d941510d2">
   Despite one last ditch attempt to finish everything off by exploding into several mini bombers, Number 6 is done in by the arrival of all the Pro Heroes, specifically All Might and Endeavor. Despite this, his main body is able to escape, with All For One confronting the skeletal remains. He notes another crisis has been averted by All Might's meddling, but still commends Number 6's creativity, how even he was able to outmaneuver All Might at the last minute, stating that now no one can stop him, and the world is his oyster.
  </p>
  <p key="6082d1b3-d89c-4adc-b45b-8da4142dede4">
   Number 6 slowly begins to rebuild his body, stumbling between the crowds of civilians using his Overclock speed to keep himself out-of-sight, all the while All For One reflects on his current burnt up display, stating that without enough Bomber cells, his combustion ended before completion, but still should be capable of achieving his final goal. He reminds Number 6 that his specialty lies with "Operation Anonymous", and with the Heroes believing to have defeated the threat, he is once again the "invisible man" and able to finish The Crawler with no one the wiser.
  </p>
  <p key="ffd07180-af4e-4914-a06a-cdee8d28096a">
   They manage to locate Koichi on a nearby rooftop, with All For One telling him to do one quick strike to kill him, also telling him to collect his body for him to study. He gleefully states to kill Koichi for him, but instead, Number 6 ignores his request, transforming into his "Rokuro Nomura" face to speak with Koichi and brushing All For One's visage away. After their conversation, Number 6 scratches Koichi, as a way of leaving a mark on the world before he leaves it, exploding in one final detonation.
  </p>
  <p key="1edd37a9-438d-4925-b473-2eba0e969e2d">
   Due to these events, All For One decides to do some research on Koichi's history, but finds nothing extraordinary about him. He is just a utterly average guy, born from ordinary parents and with a monotonous upbringing, and yet he managed to capitalize a powerful Quirk and abnormal battle prowess. The idea that circumstance, experience, and sheer force of will could turn a man into "superman", invalidates his methodology behind Operation Anonymous.
  </p>
  <p key="d576d756-84ca-4139-b89f-8893401578e3">
   Coming to this conclusion, All For One wonders how he will be able to respond when civilians start taking heroic action. If extraordinary potential is available to everyone, it may be a path to chaos, but it also introduces uncertainty into his machinations.
  </p>
  <p key="d9e53832-45c7-4739-a23f-db0a8d892d4f">
   Despite this, All For One tells to Kyudai and Kurogiri that they have to pour their efforts into their next plan. Should society reach the point where Heroes can appear from anywhere, he'll command an entity that can face any hero head-on through its own individual might. In a status tube, he looks upon their bio-engineered

   , saying that he was led to this culmination by Number 6 himself.
  </p>
  <p key="4fcbc47e-9114-4787-be65-de2806d6cfbf">
   All For One continued to groom Tomura as his successor, well aware that Tomura was really the grandson of Nana Shimura and wanted to use this to his advantage. He also assigned Kurogiri with serving and overseeing Tomura’s development,
   warning Kurogiri to use Gigantomachia once he believes to no longer be capable of ensuring Tomura's safety.
   Sometime prior to the start of the school year, he created the
   <a href="League of Villains.html" key="230e8c00-503f-4440-ae4c-8738da9655d9" title="League of Villains">
    League of Villains
   </a>
   , an organization for Tomura to run and enlist villains to aide in his cause, while acting as a front for his true goals. Shortly before the start of the school year, he learned a rumor that All Might would become a teacher at U.A., so called upon the Aoyamas, informing Yuga to apply there, intending to use him as his mole.

All For One decides to make a hypothesis then: with All Might's retirement, Endeavor has become the new number one Hero, however, it does not seem that it will be enough to contain the anxiety and concern of society, and sensing the growing insecurity in the world, the villains will rise up, believing it to be their chance to change society.

All For One wonders if All Might came here to tell him that. As he leaves, All Might tells All For One he will smash his plans as many times as it takes, and he will pass the rest of his life in prison.

   As it turns out, All For One had been monitoring the battle from an unknown location, and anticipating Lady Nagant's possible failure, had secretly transferred a self-destruct Quirk, which he had detonated upon sensing her change of heart. He mocks Lady Nagant for being a woeful and pitiful woman, remarking that she was nothing but a tool to achieve ends from everyone, and she should blame her Quirk for her tragedy.

In the message, he taunts Izuku for knowing that someone like him couldn't abandon someone like Lady Nagant, adding in that he didn't force her to join him and that it was her choice. He continues on about how those in society who fall are labeled as "villains", and even if one takes pride in their Quirk, if you can't fit into the controlled society, you'll be excluded, citing it as human nature. He concludes stating the more Izuku fights the more his soul will wear down, and reveals that while in prison, he was the one he never stopped thinking about, no longer having any interest in All Might, telling him it's "his turn" as the mansion explodes.

   After abandoning the Haibori Woods Mansion, All For One and the remnants of the League hide out in a secret cave alcove. While sitting on his own makeshift throne, surrounded by the remaining Nomu, All For One talks to Spinner about how thanks to the escaped inmates, the Heroes and Police have been too busy to put their full focus on them, allowing them to “win” their game of hide-and-seek. Spinner asks why they didn’t just leave the country, but All For One says evading everyone was just his first goal, and that he has more planned.
  </p>
  <p key="eab3dd62-cef3-4504-ac43-f199e219bc5b">
   After Tomura’s completion, and acquiring One For All, All For One’s next main goal is to get his hands on
   <a href="New Order.html" key="a384273a-d46c-4d50-ae46-fc26c9c2f6a0" title="New Order">

   , the number 1 Hero of America. He believes that with that power, alongside his own and One For All, he would finally have everything to make the entire world bend to his every whim. However, he is also aware that if Star and Stripe were to collaborate with the Japanese Heroes, especially One For All, then it would be trouble for him.
  </p>
  <p key="ae242dcc-0f74-4281-aaaa-50dd9bb56987">
   So, using his connections to the criminal underworld all over the world, he got them to stir up enough trouble so that the nations would have to prioritize their own safety, delaying their arrival to Japan. However, he learns that Star and Stripe will be making her way over to the country soon, and while that would be trouble, he also reiterates that if he can get his hands on her Quirk, nothing will be a problem anymore.
  </p>
  <p key="165218e9-5aa3-4796-b1be-24726fcecfad">
   He then turns to Spinner and tells him that after spending his time guarding him, he will be the one to support Tomura in his crusade, referring to him as “one who spins this tale,” reminding him of his status as a heteromorph. All For One then proceeds to send the still slightly incomplete Tomura out to battle to face down Star and Stripe.
  </p>
  <p key="835f1ad7-09e1-45e7-ae37-5415ffa029ad">
   Meanwhile, within Tomura Shigaraki, the vestige of All For One continues to exert control over Tomura, with the two starting to fuse together into one new being. As a result, “Tomura” now begins to recognize himself as both Tomura AND All For One, with the latter as the more dominant personality.
  </p>
  <p key="e46cf7df-8726-42b4-8be8-3b08a55485ec">
   “Tomura” goes after Star and Stripe and her army of fighter jets using a combination of Radio Waves, Air Cannon, and
   Heavy Payload
   , releasing an enormous wave of electric energy toward them. Star uses New Order, which can impose a new rule over whatever she touches and names, to remove the air from 100 metres in front of her, forcing “Tomura” to hold his breath, while All For One thinks about how it’s a horrifying Quirk that he really wants.
  </p>
  <p key="e594e9a5-7eff-41d0-83ad-ac2760b25a92">
   The jets shoot lasers at “Tomura” from every angle, which he simply uses
   Reflect
   and
   Scatter
   to shoot back, while his body regenerates. “Tomura” notices the air vacuum has come undone right after Star had used a new rule to catch the laser, wondering if that is the limit of New Order. He stretches his body and blasts his way forward toward her, but she simply jumps forward as well, punching him in the face.
  </p>
  <p key="b5a37f6d-3c9f-4043-845b-192447901da7">
   Star talks about when she was originally saved by All Might as a kid and that he inspired her to be a Hero, something that greatly irritates him as no matter where he goes it’s always about All Might. Now that she’s touched him, Star uses New Order to declare that if “Tomura Shigaraki” were to move even an inch, his heart will stop.
  </p>
  <p key="1fccfed6-52ef-4204-9f99-1bd1084c2471">
   However, “Tomura” thinks about how she fell for his trap, while All For One continues to push his dominance over Tomura, telling him how thanks to his hatred, the process that should’ve taken 2 months is now at 97-98% in just over one. He gleefully tells Tomura to let his hatred flow to deliver them to their glorious future, while the resistances permeate to the outside, with “Tomura” suddenly growing long hair and exploding.
  </p>
  <p key="6272344b-e4bd-4824-90d4-a571494b190d">
   Regaining back some control, All For One through Tomura deduces exactly how New Order works. He was able to notice some of her limitations, like how while there’s no limit to incapacitating someone, it can only power up a body to a certain amount. He also figures the rule can’t arbitrarily involve things she hasn’t touched.
  </p>
  <p key="43f93bfc-fd42-4635-bc71-a1f76e55554e">
   He realizes the true utility behind the Quirk is it has the most freedom of control with nonliving things, as when it comes to naming a living thing, both targets have to have the same sense of understanding. The reason Star’s declaration didn’t work on him was because “Tomura” isn’t sure of his true identity, whether he’s “Tomura Shigaraki”, “All For One”, or even “Tenko Shimura”, however for inanimate objects with no sense of self, Star’s one-sided understanding is enough to enforce the rule. Thinking about all the potential tests for it just makes the Quirk even more irresistible to All For One and want it even more.
  </p>
  <p key="da26ee53-4ac7-4774-bd3d-483803702b68">
   After being jostled off the plane he was just standing on, “Tomura” lands back on the flying Nomu, when the two are suddenly blown far away by a giant air visage of Star and Stripe, and proceed to be pinned downwards into the ocean with a giant laser sword.
  </p>
  <p key="6b7ec210-6921-4da1-b098-a7ee642e63d3">
   “Tomura” realizes that something big is coming, and that Star is only using the laser sword to stall, so as the dangerous
   Tiamat
   missiles arrive to finally put an end to “Tomura”, he uses the Nomu to distract the pilots, while he uses Decay to dig underground, avoiding most of the brunt of the missiles and barely surviving.
  </p>
  <p key="eb4bf716-e478-47fc-b7f1-fd232ab702a0">
   He emerges from the cracked hole, stating to them all that he was only just playing along with their game, and if it was anyone other than him they would’ve been done for. He proceeds to Burst his way forward from jet to jet, gloating how “me and myself” will make better use of her resources. One of the pilots tells Star to try and end them quickly while he’s on top of the jets, but Star is unable to do so, allowing “Tomura” to jump and grab her face.
  </p>
  <p key="b2c2b7b0-e62f-4cd8-b822-1efa3195e9f4">
   All For One within Tomura thinks about how he knew facing Star and Stripe with the incomplete body and without One For All was a gamble, but thankfully has finally paid off as he begins to steal New Order, while simultaneously Decaying Star. The Hero uses the Quirk to try and halt the Decay, but only succeeds in delaying it due to reaching the cap of her strength. Successfully obtaining New Order, All For One calls Star an idiot for trying to protect herself, and thinks back to Yoichi, and when they used to read comics, with now gaining the Quirk being just one step closer to his dream.
  </p>
  <p key="261b8985-1594-4ea4-959c-e973b1708d7b">
   However, before he can make use of it, the vestiges of Tomura and All For One are faced against a vestige of Star and Stripe, who’s presence causes “Tomura” to internally explode in the real world. As it turns out, Star had used New Order in order to declare that the Quirk would revolt against other Quirks. A gigantic Star and Stripe begins to pound away at all the vestiges, including the ones of the stolen Quirks, causing All For One to curse Star’s name.
  </p>
  <p key="16720369-6345-4cdf-91e8-eae8eed97266">
   All For One as Tomura laments to himself that he can only steal or bestow Quirks, but not dispose of them, and desperately tries to find someone he can force New Order onto to stop the Quirks from rebelling. Instead, the pilots continue to fire at “Tomura” with their laser barrage, while inside the Star vestige destroys the Reflect Quirk. All For One once again angrily curses Star and Stripe as “the spectre of All Might.”
  </p>
  <p key="45ed5a91-686a-4c02-8cd0-98b9ce711eea">
   "Tomura" takes the
   Wing
   Quirk from the remains of the Nomu and desperately escapes the battlefield, intending to find someone to pass on New Order too, once again cursing All Might's existence, taking off into the sky. He crashes in on the hideout of prison escapee,
   Kashiko Kashi
   , touching his face planning to take his Quirk to make him Quirkless, so he can safely transfer New Order without it revolting, allowing him to preserve it.
  </p>
  <p key="d508103c-02cc-43f2-8092-fa164c1652b8">
   However, as he's about to, the Star and Stripe vestige mocks him, stating that thanks to all the Quirks she revolted against, it has resulted in the destruction of the Quirk itself. As she starts to fade away, she declares even though she wasn't able to kill him, as long as people are willing to stand up to save each other, the will of heroism shall be passed on, and will put an end to him. All For One angrily balks that the winner is the one who lives the longest, as the ghost finally vanishes.

   “Tomura” returns back to the League’s secret base, screaming over in pain. All For One tells him to calm down, since their Quirk Factors are damaged and need to heal. However, “Tomura” just keeps yelling obscenities, and that as long as people remember All Might, he’ll never know peace. All For One notes how, since their minds have fused, he shares “Tomura”’s hatred, telling him even though they couldn’t steal New Order, now that they've removed their greatest obstacle, they just need to take it easy for now.
  </p>
  <p key="e15f1262-26ba-4e39-a4a7-35507df8864e">
   He tells the League to remain on standby for a bit longer, but Dabi responds against this idea, saying how he can’t stand the sight of still seeing his dad flying around. All For One tells him that while they are very alike, they have one crucial difference. While Dabi may have only one goal firmly in his mind, he's planned out many different routes over the decades, all to eventually reach his final goal. He tells him while they must wait for Tomura's body to be perfected again, now that Izuku has returned to the fortified U.A., he mentions the other thing that Dabi lacks: "
   <a href="Yuga Aoyama.html" key="fd48d1d9-e9dc-4244-b057-b4a85bdcc39a" title="Yuga Aoyama">

  <p key="75153701-3e37-4654-aa99-91bda41719eb">
   He promptly goes to contact the Aoyamas once again, with the order for Yuga to isolate Izuku somewhere so they can get him. Dabi asks All For One whether it’ll be a problem if his “friends” get caught, but he simply says it won’t be at all. If his friends succeed, he’ll be rejoiceful, but if they fail, it’s a just a brief disappointment before moving on to the next plan: his “friends” are merely just “disposable tools” that he wants to gleam the most amount of excitement as they can.
  </p>
  <p key="327929dc-d890-4971-91fe-a37c153e0d28">
   Sometime later, All For One sees Spinner checking in on Tomura's progress, which has turned him into a monstrous mutated body, before transforming back into "Tomura" himself. All For One tells Spinner not to worry as his recovery is progressing smoothly, gradually overcoming the Quirk Singularity. Spinner asks if he's "still Tomura", which he claims he is. All For One and Skeptic proceed to convince Spinner to take on the role as the commander of the Paranormal Liberation Front, to liberate the heteromorphic villains to their cause. Reluctantly taking on the role, All For One confidently states to him that "everyone can be somebody's hero".

   For the next several days, All For One continues to watch over Class 1-A using the Search Quirk, seeing their fruitless efforts in attempting to track him down. Believing that the time is right, he prepares the next part of his plan and contacts the Aoyamas. He thinks about how lies don’t work on him thanks to a Quirk that he stole back during the first era of Quirks, which has grown stronger due to his mix of his other Quirks. He recalls the original owner being a disappointment, however

   He calls up the Aoyama Family, asking for a “40 year Macallan” which they respond will be “aged 16 years” that their “son will deliver”. He asks for their son’s contact info, which they agree too. All For One senses no ill will, lies, or deception in them, meaning they’re telling the truth through their coded conversation, and all prepared, is ready to meet up tomorrow. He then calls up Yuga, who also through no deception in his voice, informs All For One of the meeting place and where he will lure Izuku to.
  </p>
  <p key="edbdecb2-6029-43e4-b9f5-539210340f07">
   In an abandoned parking lot outside U.A., All For One finally re-emerges in front of Izuku after Yuga deliberately lured him out in the opening successfully. He thanks Yuga for delivering Izuku as promised, asking how terrifying it was for betraying his friend, and congratulating him on his big speech about his goals, having also promised his family a blessed existence in his new world.

  <p key="818c49b7-c42d-4782-a7ff-d5dd0cf1321d">
   Unfortunately for him, Yuga overcomes his fear against him and turns against All For One, attacking him with his Navel Laser. All For One is caught off guard by the attack while Yuga hides in Izuku’s

   , with the two noting how he completely fell for their trap, and Yuga declaring for his mom, dad, and everyone’s sake that he’ll fight him. All For One is disappointed and confused, having not sensed any lies or ill-intent in their conversations, unsure of how they deceived him.
  </p>
  <p key="457f4887-1e97-43cf-9647-e1636bb10d8f">
   Annoyed, All For One states that even if it was a setup, he doesn't care because his prize is within reach. One For All is so close to him, and using Search, he knows all the Heroes Tomura fought in the War are miles away, so uses his Warping Quirk to summon the Paranormal Liberation Front to overwhelm One For All and finally seize his prize.

  <p key="b77b4db0-36c6-46b4-b66c-0be17be20f14">
   However, All For One is once again taken aback when he spots Kurogiri’s Warp Gate starting to appear behind them, wondering how they activated him. He thinks this saves him the trouble of getting him back, only to spot

  <p key="08da4acd-fa45-45ae-a7cb-63010a33e087">
   The second War has began, and the heroes and villains rush to attack each other. All For One wonders if they plan on fighting in an all-out brawl, when All Might activates the Troy defense system, as cages emerge from beneath the battlefield, capturing all the villains in individual metal containers. All For One knows they’re aware they could break through them all easily, until he realizes what their plan is.
   Just as they're all able to bust out after  a few seconds, that gave the Heroes just enough time for Neito to summon several more Warp Gates around the cages, allowing the Heroes to shove them all in, separating the villains.

   All For One mocks the heroes’ plan to split them up, pointing out that dividing their forces due to the decline in heroes was necessary, while also noting the supposed ill-fated decision to pit “One For All” against Tomura, and worst of all to have Shoto face off against Dabi, with All For One criticizing Endeavor for having his youngest son clean up his mess, and continuing his abuse toward the oldest.

   As the fighting continues, Endeavor and the Heroes receive word that Dabi has been defeated by Shoto, causing him to react. In response, All For One comments on Endeavor's face, taunting him that he allowed his youngest son to take the burden of defeating his eldest sibling. Hawks tells Endeavor not to listen, expecting his upcoming verbal assault, while All For One continues, berating him for not even looking at Toya and letting Shoto handle everything, confidently stating that is why he'll never win, as he prepares to attack with his arsenal of Quirks.
