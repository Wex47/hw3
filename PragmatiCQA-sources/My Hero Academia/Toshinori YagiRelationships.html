   . Nana was the one that told All Might that a true hero should smile no matter what, to reassure the people and to not only protect their lives but also their hearts. All Might greatly respected Nana as a mentor, friend and hero, to the point he even considered her as his own mother.
   In the final moments of her battle with All For One, she instructed Gran Torino to get Toshinori to safety, despite his protests. He was absolutely crushed when he witnessed her being killed.

   All Might became enraged when All For One badmouthed her and was distraught when it was revealed that Tomura is Nana's grandson. All Might wanted to save Tomura after, but Gran Torino convinced him otherwise, as he wouldn't be able to look at him as a villain.
   Gran Torino also mentioned that Tomura's existence brought Toshinori a lot of pain.

   At their first meeting, All Might merely thought of Izuku as just a fan. He came to his aid when a villain attacked him and signed his notebook, appearing to be impressed at his thorough notes on heroes. However, as Izuku insisted on talking to him, All Might's could no long keep his true form in his presence, and ended up revealing his injured state much to the boy's shock. Being upfront to him, he explained that becoming a hero without a Quirk simply wasn't possible, and suggested that Izuku could pursue a career as a policeman instead.

  <p key="83c11039-b101-4013-8d06-e8dddd4eaf86">
   Though he somewhat broke Izuku's spirits when he told him being powerless wouldn't help him be a hero, his opinion changed, and he was inspired by the way he jumped to save Katsuki from the

   Throughout the series, All Might continues to be impressed by Izuku. He commends him for the excellent work cleaning the beach during his training, and calls him cool when Izuku concentrated One For All's on his finger in his very first class, after being threatened with expulsion.
   He was also impressed at Izuku's performance at the sport's festival race, and, despite being told not to encourage Izuku's self destructive behavior, admired the way he sought to save

   However, the more his own power decreased, the more concerned he grew towards Izuku. During his fight with All For One, he admitted he has failed as a teacher, and had to admonish Izuku for recklessly endangering himself. After his retirement he also expressed his deep relief that he didn't injure himself, hugging him and promising he'd do his best for him.

   After meeting Izuku's mother, he has accepted that Izuku is no longer walking in his shadow, and promised her he would dedicate himself to her son, and help pave a different path for Izuku than the bloody one he walked through.
   No longer using up his time on hero duties, All Might also grew more dedicated to his teaching career and advised Izuku to stop trying to emulate him and find what suited him best.
  </p>
  <p key="93a4cd8b-d92d-4778-a5d0-1aaad81e1727">
   However, he remained a private person. Only after being confronted by Izuku about his relationship with Sir Nighteye did All Might let him know of the future that awaited him. He explained that Izuku's will and growth, and constant surpassing of his expectations gave him the desire to fight fate, and live long to see his successor become the hero he wishes to be.
  </p>
  <p key="0dcb5608-22db-456f-9472-ee9109a0148b">
   His relationship with Izuku goes so far as to border on the familial. Much like how All Might came to see his own predecessor, Nana Shimura, as his own mother, he often treats Izuku like the son he never had, attempting to shape him into not only an admirable hero, but also an admirable person. He is even prone to showing Izuku open affection in many ways, such as hugging him and reminding him that their bond is much deeper than blood as bearers of One For All. This familial bond has even caused members of U.A.'s faculty to question whether or not All Might has been in Izuku's corner from the start.
  </p>
  <p key="d7d84982-c7e9-4f74-8516-a6eeca14baf2">
   He has also helped Izuku train with One For All, significantly improving as a mentor and anticipating new quirk developments so that Izuku would be well prepared.
   Still, he starts to feel powerless the more Izuku progresses, feeling as though he can't do anything for him.

  <p key="2c85a834-a9bf-4bff-a27e-37fc1c91c26c">
   Within One For All, All Might's vestige was shown to be moved to the point of tears by the high regard with which Izuku held him, as well as by his selfless, kind character.

   's message to Izuku that "it's his turn", Izuku starts keeping his distance from All Might as a result of the overwhelming pressure to keep his family and friends safe, and ultimately leaves him behind to go off on his own against All Might's objections.
   This causes All Might to become despondent over how powerless he is to help his pupil and even insult himself for how he's "in the way."
   However, after Izuku's classmates manage to snap him back to his senses and bring him back to U.A., All Might and Izuku's relationship mostly reverts back to normal.

However, as the series continues, Toshinori and Katsuki's standing improves with Katsuki continuing to look up to All Might and All Might continuing to support Katsuki's development as a hero.

Katsuki is then entrusted with the secret of One For All and his taking Izuku under his wing, becoming an important part of his life.

   . When All Might fought All for One, Gran Torino joined All Might in his final battle, acting not only as an ally in combat, but as an emotional rock, keeping All Might focused in the face of All For One's provocations and taunts. Gran Torino also expressed his pride in his pupil for defeating All For One a second time while being the Symbol of Peace one last time. After All Might discovered Tomura Shigaraki was Nana Shimura's grandson, Gran Torino stopped him from going after him as it would be fruitless to try in reasoning with a criminal and All Might accepted his teacher's words.

   Ten years before the start of the series, All Might once had a talk with Endeavor and since then, they have not spoken to each other. All Might appears to respect Endeavor, wanting to get advice from him on how to raise the next generation. It seems that their rivalry is mainly one-sided (on Endeavor's) as All Might is usually friendly with him.

   After All Might's retirement and Endeavor's subsequent promotion to No. 1 hero, the two appear to be on better terms: The shock of seeing All Might in his weakened state made him question the things he sacrificed in his search for power, with Endeavor approaching the former hero on how to fill the void left by All Might. Endeavor even thanked All Might for bringing his son back to him, which All Might stated wasn't a problem. Later on, he sincerely asked him what it truly is to be the Symbol of Peace.

   Sir Nighteye was once All Might's sidekick before their eventual falling out when their values conflicted in regards to All Might's injuries. Nighteye pleaded with All Might to retire and find a successor. Nighteye believed that by retiring, All Might's legend would live on and that he would only damage the citizens and other heroes who look up to him if he pushed himself. All Might refused his partner's advice for fear of another villain as powerful as All For One rising to power in his absence.
  </p>
  <p key="523ab687-46af-475e-a049-607381150ae9">
   During their argument, Nighteye brought up a future he saw of All Might via his Quirk, where All Might would clash with a villain and meet a gruesome demise. As his foresight was never wrong, he did not want to see All Might's death. From there, they had a fight and separated.
  </p>
  <p key="d11ee2ce-4f90-47ea-ab91-346922dc54b4">
   Despite this, Nighteye doesn't hold any resentment against All Might, and still admires him and cares for him despite their disagreements. However, All Might was reluctant with the idea of meeting his old sidekick again due to becoming something Nighteye warned him about. This is also one of the reasons why he refuses to help Izuku to getting an introduction to Nighteye. Equally, in spite of all the admiration that he professes to him, Sir Nighteye thinks that All Might's decision to choose to Izuku as his successor was a mistake.

   Very soon, Nighteye was critically
   injured in a battle
   and All Might made the choice to see his old friend one last time. He was sad as Nighteye laid in pain as he begged the latter to hang on so he can properly make amends, but Nighteye he had already forgiven All Might and was happy he just came to see him. Nighteye stated he saw the potential of Izuku that All Might saw and deemed him worthy of being the latter's successor. When Nighteye died, All Might shed tears at the loss of his old friend.

   Naomasa and All Might met while the latter (in base form) was posing as All Might's contact, in recommendation of Naomasa's partner. While they were having a conversation in a café, All Might constantly made excuses and run to perform quick deeds as All Might. When he accidentally returns with the uniform still visible (revealing his dual identity as All Might), Naomasa calls him out on not filing reports on all of his heroic activities (as customary of a Pro Hero). Taking pity on the number 1 Hero, Naomasa offered to file the reports himself, letting All Might act without any worries apart from telling Naomasa what he was doing.

All Might fought All For One five years ago and defeated him, which furthered All For One's hatred for All Might. All For One is an incredibly powerful villain and gave All Might his critical wounds that limit his ability to perform his duties as a hero. All Might is very cautious about All For One, going as far as to warn Izuku of the dangers that he poses. He seems to also place his hand on the wound All For One dealt him when talking about him. Toshinori also unconsciously grips his old wound during Endeavor's fight with High-End as the circumstances were parallel to Toshinori's fight with All For One as both were cataclysmic battles where the hero and villain were grievously injuring each other. In their final battle, All For One continually taunted All Might, knowing where to strike to enrage and wound All Might, bringing up his former master and her grandson.

He showed a penchant for manipulation, enjoying playing mind games with All Might in an attempt to provoke him into leaking information from the outside world. He also mentioned that the life-threatening injuries that left him blinded and scarred are why he worked so hard to cultivate a plan for empowering Tomura. In turn, All Might simply turned away and promised that he would still do everything he could to interfere with All For One's ambitions, showing that their enmity had only fermented and grown in potency.

   . Chizome's respect and admiration for All Might runs so deep that before finally falling unconscious, Chizome declared that only All Might is allowed to defeat him.
   In a discussion with Gran Torino, Toshinori voiced how it was surprising that the latter scared his mentor. He also noted new villains would be inspired by Stain's speech and how it would be for society.

   Following the Paranormal Liberation War, All Might meets Stain face-to-face in Kamino, surprised by their meeting after his retirement. Stain initially did not believe he was All Might and calls him a fake desecrating All Might's sacred grounds. Even when All Might showed his muscle form, Stain refused to believe he was actually talking to him, calling All Might a man who helped people regardless of the power he held, showing that his respect for him runs deeper than expected. However, he did imply to Toshinori that he was already aware of his current state, telling him that if he is a true hero, to make use of his information from Tartarus, throwing a knife containing the data disk, as well as a personalized letter to All Might attached, toward him.

   All Might meets Izuku's mother for the first time when he goes to their apartment to talk to her about the dorm system. Inko is amazed that the former pro-hero decided to visit her home and is nervous by his arrival. She reveals that she's against it and wants to pull her son out of U.A. High School, because she does not trust that they can protect her son. Inko wishes to support her son in his dream, but his mounting injuries as well as the school being attacked multiple times has caused her to lose confidence. Also, she knows that Izuku looks up to All Might so much that she is worried this will lead him down the same blood filled path.

   Izuku is shocked by his mother's revelation, but he understands her and told her there would be no problem as long as he managed to become a hero in another school. All Might transforms into his muscular form and bows before Inko and Izuku. All Might apologizes to Inko for his negligence as Izuku's teacher and understands that she is worried about the bloody path of a Hero, but reveals that he believes Izuku should become the new symbol of peace. All Might returns to his weak form and expresses his desire to raise Izuku to prevent him from walking down a blood-stained path to heroism. He asks that Inko look beyond the current U.A. and look to a future U.A. that's trying to change for its students. Finally, All Might asks that she allow him to pour his all into Izuku, and even promises to protect and raise Izuku, even at the cost of his own life.

   Inko is shocked at All Might's resolve. She states that all she wants is Izuku to be happy and tells All Might that he should never trade his life away for someone else's sake. She asks All Might to live properly and raise her son. If All Might promises her that, she will allow Izuku to attend U.A. High again. All Might promises to do so and Inko asks that he take good care of her son. Izuku promises to not make his mother worry any longer.

   Outside, after Izuku and All Might manage to convince her to let Izuku stay at U.A., All Might compliments Inko for being a wonderful parent, telling Izuku that she reminds him of his master Nana.

   All Might met Melissa when she was still a child, during the years he was working as a hero in the United States, with her father as an ally. He tells her that, despite her being Quirkless, she can be a hero to other people in other ways, just as her father is to him as he is the only one capable of producing to him the right equipment. Hearing how her father was a hero to All Might inspired her to follow her dad's footsteps and become a support engineer.

   Later on, she becomes familiar with All Might enough to refer to him as "Uncle Might" when she invites him over to I-Island in email.
