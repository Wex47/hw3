   Although the Safety Commission had been trusted by society to keep the peace, in actuality, the organization had an underlying corruptness in its acts to protect society's image of heroes in order to maintain the status quo. The original President of the Commission always treated their workers as disposable assets, primarily using people from the underside of society to do their dirty work. However, when Pro Heroes committing crimes increased and became more organized, the Commission was no longer able to deal with them, and so, turned to recruiting and using Pro Heroes so that they could freely move when going against other Heroes in public.

   , also known as Lady Nagant, to become an assassin, secretly killing corrupt heroes and villains under the people's eyes, to preserve their peace. Lady Nagant's mental health began to worsen as a result of also having to keep up the public façade, and when she questioned about the morality of these actions and suggested being transparent, the previous President threatened to silence her, resulting in his death, which was then covered up.
  </p>
  <p key="3991fa86-cc22-44d0-b0d3-d967972ef57f">
   Rather than executing Lady Nagant, the current President chose to instead lock her up in

   . She had disagreed with the previous President's methods, and ordered her imprisonment so as there was no fear of information leaks, as well as prevent her from being executed, and using her as an example to discourage disputes between Heroes, claiming Lady Nagant's arrest was due to her killing a Hero in an argument.
  </p>
  <p key="347564f6-9b52-4841-8ec5-5a4eff8f646c">
   In order to prevent failures from Lady Nagant's incident from happening again, she focused in on Keigo Takami as her successor, intending to educate and train him from an even younger age, to have him fulfill his duty his whole life. He is implied to have taken part in some of these immoral actions for the sake of the organization that raised him, though not to the same level as Lady Nagant, which he remained conflicted about.
