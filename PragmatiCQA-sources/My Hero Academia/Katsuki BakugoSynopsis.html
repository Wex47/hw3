   Katsuki Bakugo grew up in the same neighborhood as

   since they were young children. Izuku and Katsuki's other childhood friends gave him the nickname "Kacchan". Izuku and the other boys always looked up to Katsuki because of his energy, confidence, and natural-born talents (shown by his ability to juggle a football, read as well as making a stone skip seven times on water as a four year old; he was the type who could do anything he tried his hand at). Because of this praise, Katsuki developed a rather arrogant and self-inflated view of himself and would often pick on Izuku and gave him the nickname "Deku". Despite this, Izuku continued to follow him around.
  </p>
  <p key="a972944d-7e51-4e04-94db-9fe845bb3f8e">
   Katsuki always admired All Might when he was young because the number one hero would always win against the odds. While watching a video of him at the electronics store, Katsuki tells his friends that All Might is the greatest hero because of his ability to achieve victory. Sometime later, Katsuki defeated a few fourth graders, as a first-grader, who bumped into him. With Izuku looking on, Katsuki says that the most amazing hero always wins no matter what.

   and other talents. As a result of this, he developed a twisted superiority complex as a young child. Believing himself to be better than everyone else, Katsuki looked down on Izuku especially because he lacked a Quirk altogether.
  </p>
  <p key="f453b0ba-0427-4b83-a10b-c7cb6a06fa44">
   Despite this, Izuku still considered the two of them to be friends at the time, but things escalated when Izuku tried to help Katsuki after he fell off a small bridge into a stream. Izuku offered a helping hand, but Katsuki's pride caused him to take this an insult. He believed that Izuku made him appear as if he needed aid from someone who is much beneath him. This would strain the relationship between the two for years to come.

   At the end of Aldera's academic year, Katsuki and Izuku are praised by their teacher for being the only two students in school history to get accepted into U.A. Katsuki angrily confronted Izuku and demanded to know what trick Izuku used to pass the exam. Katsuki wanted to be the only one from their school to attend U.A. and threatens for Izuku to change schools. However, Izuku stands up to Katsuki for the first time by refusing to withdraw, claiming that he now has someone who believes in him and he won't let them down.

   Shota uses Katsuki as an example to explain the test. Throughout middle school, physical tests were always given without Quirks in mind. This led to Katsuki only throwing about sixty-five meters on his original ball toss. This time, Katsuki uses his Quirk to throw the ball and his explosive toss sends the ball over seven hundred meters.

   The class goes through several different physical tests, including a fifty-meter dash and a standing long jump. Katsuki uses his Quirk to excel in both and claims that his Quirk is the most versatile in the class.

   When Izuku takes the pitching test, Katsuki mocks him for being powerless but is shocked when Izuku uses a Quirk to toss the ball as far as he did. Katsuki is as angry as he is perplexed. He is not only confused about Izuku's new abilities, but enraged at the thought that Izuku had been lying about beign Quirkless all their lives. He angrily tried to attack Izuku for an explanation, but Shota stops him from doing so using his Quirk and capture weapon.

  <p key="61f0dade-d256-4257-99dd-afad666e85bf">
   As combat training begins, Katsuki still ponders over Izuku's Quirk and started to get angry as he believed Izuku was intentionally hiding his abilities from him for years and was playing him. He goes off his own and attempts to ambush Izuku and Ochaco. Izuku evades and saves Ochaco even though Katsuki manages to burn off his mask.

   Katsuki tries to attack Izuku again, but he is countered and slammed to the ground by the latter. Izuku reveals to the surprised Katsuki that the same notebook Katsuki previously burned and threw out had notes about Katsuki's moves along with other heroes, which he memorized and knew ways to counter them. Finally standing his ground to Katsuki, Izuku tells him that he is no longer the same kid Katsuki used to bully and the name "Deku" would be a hero name, as Katsuki is angered at his declaration.
  </p>

   but breaks free. Then Izuku retreats, forcing Katsuki to search the building alone, giving Ochaco a chance to escape and find Tenya. Tenya tries to contact Katsuki, but he is too focused on attacking Izuku that he ignores him.
  </p>
  <p key="b83f8c0b-3967-4323-add1-468edda59282">
   Katsuki eventually finds Izuku, demanding he use his Quirk while revealing information about his own. He explains that his Explosion Quirk works by detonating the nitroglycerin he sweats. The gauntlets on his costume store this "nitro-sweat", and once they're full Katsuki can fire off a huge blast.
  </p>
  <p key="6bca68fc-f684-49b4-ae07-74dd7f9820af">
   All Might cautions him not to use the attack, but Katsuki does so anyway though he minimizes the damage. Izuku narrowly evades and the blast destroys a large portion of the building. All Might warns Katsuki should he use that attack again, his team will be disqualified.
  </p>
  <p key="69fc79c6-83e8-4e64-bd3b-8e51fa0f6700">
   Katsuki takes the duel into close quarters, where he easily dominates Izuku in combat while berating him. He uses his explosions charging forward where he gets in the air using his explosions which leads him to changing his trajectory in a blast that doubles as a smokescreen which finally causes him to blasting Izuku from behind. Then he grabs onto Izuku's arm and slams him into the ground after using explosions from his free hand to build up momentum. Firstly, Katsuki's fighting style garners him much commendation amongst his classmates but secondly his peers and All Might note his tendency to go too far as well as act like a villain.
  </p>
  <p key="0c09423b-9c0c-4ab7-96c7-bb5aa3f916cd">
   Katsuki again demands that Izuku use his Quirk and questions whether Izuku feels he is too good for him now. This irritates Izuku, who expresses that he has always felt Katsuki was better, and that's why he wants to beat him.
  </p>
  <p key="4fbb3357-e7a9-46b6-b1fc-be4d3622d73f">
   Filled with emotion, both fighters rush each other for a final clash as Izuku uses his Quirk which delights Katsuki as he moves to attack. Knowing he cannot defeat Katsuki at close range, Izuku alerts Ochaco and uses his Quirk to smash the ceilings from every building story above him. The shockwave creates enough debris for Ochaco to use on the floor above. She uses her Quirk to float the debris and sends them flying at Tenya, then uses the opening to grab the weapon and secure the victory for Team A.

  <p key="649975e0-4da3-4dc8-8d73-0a4c60b4ba70">
   In disbelief at his loss, Katsuki begins to panic and hyperventilate at the idea of losing to Izuku for once. He is soon calmed and consoled by All Might, who tells Katsuki that it does not matter whether he won or lost, but that he takes a look back to reflect on his experience and learn from it. All Might leads Katsuki back to the monitoring room with the rest of the class where they critique the match.

   After all the Battle Trial's are completed and the school day is done, Katsuki storms out of the school but is closely followed by Izuku. Once he catches up, Katsuki asks if he will gloat but Izuku reveals that he hasn't been deceiving Katsuki about his Quirk. Izuku goes on to reveal that he got his Quirk from someone else and can't yet control it, but Katsuki refuses to believe that as the whole thing sounded ridiculous.
  </p>
  <p key="d37555a7-5319-4078-a7d0-f5b649b3d4d5">
   In response, Katsuki admits his failure and inferiority to others even admitting to agreeing with Momo and acknowledges he can't defeat Shoto in a head to head fight. His pride has been damaged, but Katsuki declares that he will never lose again and will follow his dreams to become the best. All Might arrives and tries to console Katsuki again, but this time Katsuki tells him off and promises to surpass the number one hero without his help.

   Together, Katsuki and Eijiro easily defeat the villains trying to ambush them in the Ruins Zone. While discussing what to do next, they disagree on their next course of action. Katsuki wants to defeat Kurogiri and cut off the villains' escape route while Eijiro desires to save his classmates.

   A villain tries to take Katsuki by surprise, but he swiftly counters and routs the villain. He reassures Eijiro that their peers can handle themselves against the weak criminals. Eijiro is impressed by Katsuki's calm demeanor, but this only angers Katsuki who claims he's always that way. Eijiro continues by stating that perhaps Katsuki is saying to have faith in their peers, and decides to accompany Katsuki's search for Kurogiri.

   They arrive at the central plaza just in time to save the day. Kurogiri almost warps Izuku away, but Katsuki swoops in and blasts the villain while yelling for Izuku to get out of his way. Katsuki pins Kurogiri down by his neck armor and explains that he's already discovered the villain's weakness. Kurogiri's body is not fully intangible, he hides his physical form under the black smoke from his Quirk.

Tomura Shigaraki orders Nomu to free Kurogiri, and Katsuki is not fast enough to react to Nomu. He is saved when All Might takes the brunt of Nomu's attack, but Kurogiri is freed as a result. Katsuki watches the ensuing battle in awe, where All Might uses his incredible power to defeat Nomu.

   Katsuki comments on how intense the situation is and decides to remove himself from the rest of the fight. However, Izuku rushes to All Might's side. Katsuki notices the incredible speed Izuku uses to confront the villains. Izuku and All Might are saved when Tenya returns to the U.S.J. with Pro Heroes as reinforcements.
   Katsuki is then instructed to leave with the rest of the class and they meet outside the facility. Katsuki continues to wonder about Izuku's Quirk, but is abruptly told by Eijiro to return with the class to school.

Another student, this time from Class 1-B of the Hero Course Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu, yells at Katsuki for being arrogant but Katsuki ignores him and walks away. Eijiro says Katsuki can't leave after making everyone hate Class 1-A. Katsuki does so anyway, saying that the people don't matter and the only thing that's important is that he defeats them all.

   For the next two weeks before the festival, Katsuki trains at the Replica City District. When the day of the U.A. Sports Festival arrives, Katsuki changes into his P.E. clothes and prepares with his class in their designated waiting room. Like the rest of his peers, Katsuki overheard Shoto Todoroki challenging Izuku. Katsuki takes exception to this because he feels as if Shoto is declaring war on the wrong person.

   Before the festival begins, First Year Chief Referee: Midnight calls Katsuki to the stage to lead the pledge. Instead, he simply announces that he will win the games, angering his fellow competitors and generates boos from the crowd. Midnight announces the preliminaries will be an Obstacle Race four kilometers around the stadium, which immediately begins after the rules are explained. Shoto gets out to an early lead by freezing the stadium's exit, but Katsuki avoids the ice by using his explosions to propel himself past them.

Katsuki reaches the next obstacle soon after: The Fall, a canyon laced with tightropes. Katsuki avoids using the tightropes all together by flying over the canyon completely. After Shoto reaches the final leg of the race: the Mine Field and is forced to slow down, Katsuki finally catches up to him.
  </p>
  <p key="75f27c4a-83b0-4b11-bacb-83d19b641d71">
   Katsuki yells at Shoto for declaring war on the wrong rival, and the two engage in combat as they run for first place. Then suddenly, a giant explosion goes off, propelling Izuku past both of them.
   Although Katsuki and Shoto momentarily catch back up, Izuku uses a second explosion to stop them for just enough time to cross the finish line first. Katsuki crosses the finish line after Shoto, placing him in third. Katsuki is enraged after losing to Izuku again, but he qualifies for the second round: The Cavalry Battle.
  </p>
  <p key="e0ba103f-58e9-48ea-b083-0fd000dcfbf0">
   While Midnight explains the rules of the Cavalry Battle, she notes that anyone who knocks other teams down will be disqualified, irritating Katsuki. Having placed third in the Obstacle Race, Katsuki is worth two hundred points for the Cavalry Battle.

   Soon after, Katsuki's headband is stolen by Neito Monoma from Class 1-B. Neito takes a moment to explain that Class 1-B purposely placed low in the Obstacle Race to scout their Class 1-A Rivals, calling them fools for obsessing for winning over the preliminaries. He continues to taunt Katsuki by recognizing him as the victim from the sludge villain incident. Now absolutely livid, Katsuki explains that his team has a new agenda: to annihilate Team Monoma before they go after Izuku.
  </p>
  <p key="5825d750-8838-4037-93df-b2b7a4b1e3b2">
   Katsuki attacks Neito, but the latter evades and then counters using an explosion of his own. When Katsuki tries to blast him again, Neito uses Eijiro's hardening power to block it. This forces Katsuki to realize that Neito's Quirk is the ability to copy other Quirks. When Katsuki tries to attack again, his team is immobilized by Neito's classmate: Kojiro Bonto. As Team Monoma runs away, Neito takes a moment to taunt Katsuki over his address at the opening ceremony for the festival. This infuriates Katsuki, but his determination to win remains steadfast.

  <p key="4edc0164-0536-422a-91ea-674035b0fced">
   Mina uses her Quirk to free the team and Katsuki uses an explosion to propel himself at Team Monoma. One of their members: Kosei Tsuburaba uses his Solid Air Quirk to repel Katsuki, but only for a few moments. Katsuki punches through the air shield and grabs two of the headbands around Neito's neck as he tries to flee, then Hanta recovers Katsuki using his Tape Quirk. Undeterred by his team's elevation into second place, Katsuki orders his team to continue pursuing Neito. Katsuki claims that he will go after Izuku's ten million points after they recover the headband Neito stole from them.

   Katsuki strategically uses his teammates Quirk's to close the distance between the two teams. Kosei tries to stop him, but Katsuki blasts through the air shield and takes Neito's last headband. All Might is impressed that Katsuki understands a truth that no one needed to teach him: "there's a difference between those who aim for the top and those who settle, and that difference matters". Shota comments that although Class 1-B had a good strategy, they failed to take Katsuki's "overwhelming tenacity" into account. Even after securing more than enough points to advance, Katsuki urges his team to go after the Izuku's team.

   With only seconds remaining, Katsuki's team joins the fray already brewing between Team Midoriya and Team Todoroki. Katsuki notices that Team Todoroki has secured the ten million points, and damns Shoto for it. Katsuki tries to go after Shoto, but time runs out. Despite placing second in the event and moving onto the finals, Katsuki is extremely frustrated after failing to be the undeniable champion of the round.

  <p key="d5f9ad50-5501-4a2b-962c-ddf8345d3ed3">
   During the lunch break, Katsuki secretly eavesdrops on Shoto's conversation with Izuku in the student entrance corridor. Shoto explains that his father created him to usurp All Might, and he plans to win the festival without using his father's power. Katsuki leaves after Izuku replies that he will do his best to defeat Shoto.

   Midnight reveals that the finals will be a one on one fighting tournament and everyone draws lots for their matchups. Katsuki is set to face Ochaco, but he fails to recognize her name and questions who she might be.

   Katsuki watches the first match between Izuku and Hitoshi Shinso. He becomes nostalgic when Izuku wins using the same shoulder throw he used during the Battle Trial. Denki reminds him of this, Katsuki tells "Sparky" to shut his mouth.

   Seven matches later, Katsuki takes to the ring to face his opponent: Ochaco. He warns "pink cheeks" to withdraw from the match because he isn't going to hold anything back. She refuses and starts the engagement by rushing Katsuki. He immediately blows her away with an explosion and repeats that she should've dropped out of the tournament. He blasts her again, only to realize he's exploded only her jacket. She threw it through the smoke as a distraction and nearly gets the drop on Katsuki. Thanks to his incredible reaction time, he's able to blast Ochaco away before she can touch him and use her Quirk to send him out of bounds.
  </p>
  <p key="100f726d-a57e-4a8e-a0fd-1054632008f7">
   Ochaco continues to rush Katsuki over and over again, and although Katsuki continues to blast her repeatedly, she continues her assault without resting between attacks. The crowd starts to boo Katsuki for being too rough, but Shota calls out the man who starts the uproar. He explains that Katsuki's fierceness is an acknowledgement of his opponent's strength, and he's simply doing everything he can to keep Ochaco at bay so he can come out on top.
  </p>
  <p key="a5c64c38-5678-4081-8069-64349ccd9cb9">
   As the smoke clears from all the explosions, Ochaco remains undeterred, still standing from Katsuki's barrage. Katsuki keeps his guard up, uneasy that Ochaco "isn't dead yet". This time, rather than dash at him, Ochaco thanks Katsuki for keeping his focus on her. Confused, Katsuki glances up to see a great amount of debris floating high above them. Ochaco kept low to the ground as she moved so that Katsuki's explosions tore up the floor of the ring, creating weapons for her. Then she kept him focused on her by attacking relentlessly, rendering Katsuki oblivious to the impending
   Meteor Storm

  <p key="3effbb97-ed16-43ee-a9b4-406dbab4570e">
   As she releases her Quirk, causing all the debris to fall down towards Katsuki, Ochaco rushes at him to try and capitalize on an opening. Without any other choice, Katsuki unleashes a large, powerful explosion that repels all the debris, horrifying his opponent as she gets blown away as well.
  </p>
  <p key="84a8b595-3336-42f6-92f7-c1254925077c">
   Katsuki figured Ochaco would have some sort of plan since he now remembered her as being friends with Izuku, and quietly states to himself that this was a close call. Katsuki rushes Ochaco, claiming it is time to get serious. She tries to stand up and fight, but ends up collapsing. He keeps his guard up even as she crawls towards him, but Ochaco ultimately falls unconscious and Katsuki is declared the winner.
  </p>
  <p key="909f1ed3-6859-4837-91b3-79c84773cb22">
   On his way to the student section, Katsuki happens upon Izuku in the hallway and is immediately irritated by his presence. He accuses Izuku of providing Ochaco with her "annoying" strategy, but Izuku angrily denies it and says that if the battle was harder than Katsuki had anticipated, then it is because of Ochaco's own plan and not his. Katsuki eventually makes his way back to the stands with his classmates, who tease him for playing the villain in his fight. He angrily tells them to shut up, and Denki comments in disbelief that Katsuki would aim a powerful explosion at a fragile girl. Katsuki sits down and replies that he most definitely would not label Ochaco as frail.

  <p key="b55df8f6-4d4b-401e-8a15-eaa81968c4ec">
   As the match between Izuku and Shoto begins, Eijiro returns from his victory to sit down with his class. Eijiro tells Katsuki that they will fight next, to which Katsuki replies that he'll kill him. Eijiro laughs it off and then sarcastically says it must be nice that Katsuki and Shoto can use attacks that blast the entire stadium. Hanta adds that they also do not need to pause between attacks.

  <p key="e7c06fd5-487d-4573-a2bf-e7b6717b7380">
   Katsuki calls them morons and explains that just like sprinting drains your breath, Quirks can be worn out because they are physical abilities too. Then Katsuki thinks to himself about his own limits and muses over that he designed his costume so that he could fire off stronger blasts than his body normally allows him to.

  <p key="b09e7ccb-2f47-4b9a-969b-2284be2820e4">
   Continuing to watch the battle between Izuku and Shoto closely, Katsuki notes that Shoto's movements have become sloppy and assumes the reason behind it is because all the frost forming on his body. Katsuki compares Shoto's Quirk to that of a video game's MP meter.

   As the second round proceeds, Katsuki faces Eijiro in his next match. Katsuki and Eijiro trade blows, but Eijiro's hardened body dampens Katsuki's Explosions while Katsuki's cheek is cut open by Eijiro's hardened punch. Katsuki is forced on the defensive because of Eijiro's defensive abilities, but is eventually able to injure Eijiro after landing a few more explosions.

  <p key="16fa57fb-9920-4d3c-be4f-1e69c7b49827">
   Katsuki realizes that Eijiro's Hardening weakens through continuous strikes and takes advantage of that by barraging him with a series of explosions. Eijiro's defense eventually gives way and he is knocked unconscious by Katsuki's final blast.

   In his semi-final match up, Katsuki duels with Fumikage. He comments that Fumikage's Dark Shadow is annoying and continues to brutalize it using his explosions. Fumikage is forced completely on the defensive as Katsuki's attacks continue to get faster, not giving his opponent any room to counter attack.

   After striking Dark Shadow with an explosion in mid-air, Fumikage orders it to grab Katsuki, but he evades and jumps behind them. Then Katsuki uses his stun grenade technique to flood the arena with light and pins down Fumikage by exploiting their weakness of light. Fumikage asks if Katsuki knew his weakness all along, to which Katsuki replies he learned by attacking over and over again. Katsuki admits it was an unfair match up for Fumikage and tells him that he's finished. Fumikage surrenders and Katsuki proceeds to the finals to face Shoto Todoroki.

   Katsuki accidentally barges into the wrong waiting room and finds Shoto there. He yells at Shoto for being in the waiting room until he realizes that he's actually entered the wrong room. Shoto doesn't pay Katsuki any mind, much to his irritation. He uses a small explosion to try and intimidate Shoto, saying that he better bring his best to their upcoming bout. Shoto replies that Izuku told him the same thing, and then asks if he was so helpful during their childhood. This greatly annoys Katsuki, who kicks over the table and yells for Shoto to ignore Izuku and his family issues so that he can use his fire during their battle. Katsuki angrily exits the room and states he wants everyone to know he can beat Shoto at full strength. While walking through the hallway Katsuki muses over the thought of bombing the entire stadium in the finals.

   The U.A. Sports Festival's finale between Katsuki and Shoto begins soon after.
   Shoto opens the fight with a large scale ice attack. At first it appears that Katsuki is frozen inside the icy prison, but he endures it by blasting through the ice with his explosions. After freeing himself from the frozen prison, Katsuki says Shoto has powerful attacks, but he also has bad aim and needs to try harder. He rushes Shoto, who attempts to touch him with his right side, but Katsuki uses a small explosion in mid-air to avoid being frozen. Katsuki grabs on to Shoto's left side and throws him away. Shoto recovers by creating a wave of ice that he surfs and sends towards his opponent.

  <p key="aa4703e7-8dff-4f46-a3c8-bb24d6f81559">
   Katsuki tries to blast Shoto, but he avoids and grabs onto Katsuki's arm using his left hand. Instead of burning Katsuki, Shoto simply tosses him away. This only annoys Katsuki, who questions if Shoto feels he's unworthy of his flames. He continues, threatening to kill Shoto and berates him for not giving their match his best. Katsuki demands Shoto use his fire so that he can defeat him at his best and prove that beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is the strongest student at the festival.

   Shoto mulls over his words until suddenly Izuku starts cheering for him from the crowd. Katsuki notices and comments that Izuku is a stupid nerd before propelling himself in the air. Encouraged by Izuku, Shoto ignites his flames, exciting Katsuki. To counter, Katsuki decides to use his special move: Howitzer Impact. He begins his attack by using small explosions to propel himself in a circular motion and create a twister that surrounds him. However, just as the two superpowers are about to clash, Shoto extinguishes his flames and exposes himself to Katsuki's large scale explosion.

  <p key="37a0e945-2e04-440d-b601-bdff541b9384">
   When the smoke clears, Katsuki realizes Shoto did not actually use his fire and has been blasted outside the ring. Unsatisfied, Katsuki runs over to Shoto even though he's unconscious and furiously demands that he get back up because a victory in this manner is meaningless to him. Midnight uses her Quirk to knock Katsuki out and declares him the victor of the battle and first year champion of the U.A. Sports Festival.

   When Katsuki awakens he goes ballistic with fury, still angry with Shoto for basically throwing their match. He has to be restrained, muzzled and chained to the champions podium during the closing ceremony for the festival. All Might removes the restraint mask on his face before congratulating him on foreshadowing his victory during the opening ceremony. He notices Katsuki's face is scary thanks to his undeniable rage and tries to give him the gold medal. Katsuki refuses and tells All Might to get that "garbage" away from him because he still hasn't proved he's the best. All Might tries to encourage Katsuki to accept the medal even if it's just as a scar. Katsuki still refuses, so All Might forces it in his mouth.

Katsuki remains fuming even until the next day, where he wakes up at noon and angrily brushes his teeth, yelling for his mouth germs to die as his mother shouts at him to stop being loud.

Katsuki received 3,556 offers from Pro Heroes, second highest in the class behind only Shoto. Denki comments that this is because Pros may have been reluctant to send nominations to a student who needed to be chained up at the end of the festival. Katsuki angrily replies that if a Pro was scared away, than they are just weak.

   The next day, Best Jeanist scolds Katsuki on the importance of a hero maintaining an elegant appearance. He styles Katsuki's wild spiky hair into a neat side part similar to his own. While Best Jeanist's sidekicks believe that the interns new hairstyle is an improvement, Katsuki starts to regret choosing the agency.

   Sometime during the internship, Katsuki goes out on patrol with Best Jeanist. He tells Katsuki that patrolling helps to dissuade villains from committing crimes and asks the boy the if he knows the other important reason for patrolling, to which he answers that if any villains do strike, they can find and beat them up faster and more easily. Best Jeanist says this answer is wrong and corrects him, telling him that the patrols are to show the public who heroes are and give them peace of mind. To emphasize his point, he waves at a group of school girls who recognized him and started to swoon over the No. 4 Hero. Then, a few small children recognize Katsuki from what he believes to be the Sports Festival. However, they actually recall him from the
   Sludge Villain Incident

   The internship concludes at the end of the Week and Katsuki returns to U.A. High. His first day back, he is immediately met by Eijiro and Hanta hysterically laughing and making fun of his new haircut. Embarrassed, Katsuki demands that they stop, telling them that his hair had gotten used to its new style and he couldn’t get it to return to its previous style. Katsuki threatens them, but they just continue laughing, telling them that they'd like to see him try and calling him "pretty boy". This nickname causes Katsuki to lash out at them in anger and his hair returns to normal.

   One week prior to Final Exams, Eijiro notes that Momo is being virtuous in her studies and suggests that he may join her. Katsuki who came in third in mid-term grades, angrily asks if Eijiro wants him to beat the lessons into his head, as Eijiro states he's counting on it. After lunch, Katsuki overhears Denki and Mina talking about how the practical portion of the finals consists of fighting robotic villains. Katsuki believes they're far too excited and yells at them both, telling them he'd destroy whatever was in the way and they needed to learn to control their Quirks as the scared duo note he is right.

  <p key="21d75723-88c5-4b2a-9054-ffd75298cc72">
   Katsuki turns his attention to Izuku and states that the way the latter is using his Quirk now is pissing him off. Ochaco figures that Katsuki is referring to Izuku's movements, during the rescue training race and how they matched Katsuki's own. Katsuki claims that he doesn't want an empty victory like the U.A. Sports Festival, and says that their personal grades in the upcoming finals will determine their status. Katsuki declares he will the best as he threatens to defeat Shoto as well before he storms out of class. Eijiro notes that Katsuki hasn't been so intense in a while, and Fumikage replies that impatience and hatred have gotten the better of him. As Katsuki walks through the school corridors, Shota notes that Katsuki is getting worse.

  <p key="f2eca097-eeb5-4c47-a8a4-2f274fe33426">
   In the days leading up to final exams, Katsuki helps Eijiro study. After completing the written portion of the exams, Katsuki and his class meet at the training grounds in their costumes for the practical portion. There, Class 1-A meets with the teachers and Principal Nezu explains that the practical has been changed from fighting robotic villains to being paired together and facing off with one of the teachers. Katsuki is shocked to find out that he and Izuku have been paired together against All Might in the tenth and final match.
  </p>
  <p key="d203edad-6d56-42df-81bc-a4a9a4ff5300">
   Principal Nezu goes on to explain that students can either escape or handcuff their teacher to pass the exam within thirty minutes. All Might adds that the teachers will wear high-density weights to give the students a handicap. Katsuki claims that the teachers are underestimating the students but All Might replies that they will see during their battle. Shota dismisses the students, and Katsuki shuns Izuku to wait for their battle alone.
  </p>
  <p key="e1565ddb-69a6-408a-878c-08265d85e7a6">
   When the time arrives for their match, Katsuki tries to ignore Izuku while walking through the replica city. Izuku pleads with Katsuki to consider escaping rather than fighting All Might. Katsuki refutes him and says that he will beat All Might himself. Izuku replies that it isn't possible, angering Katsuki enough for him to hit Izuku and demand he stops speaking. Izuku says he's trying to communicate so they can pass, but Katsuki replies that Izuku's power isn't needed in this battle. They begin yelling at each other but are interrupted when a shockwave sent by All Might decimates the city street.
  </p>
  <p key="a7c379e7-222b-4ff4-82f0-4635add7b0c4">
   Katsuki notices All Might's malicious presence and notes how intimidating it is. Izuku wishes to run, but despite this Katsuki decides to stand his ground. He uses Stun Grenade to blind All Might but the hero resists and grabs Katsuki's face. Katsuki counterattacks with small consecutive explosions that don't appear to harm All Might and he slams Katsuki into the ground. When he recovers, Katsuki tries to rush All Might but ends up crashing into a fleeing Izuku. After the recoil, Izuku tells Katsuki they need to retreat and Katsuki replies that he will win because that's what heroes do. This prompts Izuku to remember their childhood and how Katsuki admired All Might as a hero because he always won in the end regardless of the situation.
  </p>
  <p key="bb5bec58-c653-4ae1-9537-4674deac588e">
   Izuku continues his pleas to no avail and then suddenly All Might pins down Izuku using a guardrail before sending Katsuki flying with a punch powerful enough to make him vomit. All Might approaches Katsuki and says he understands Katsuki's anger is because of Izuku's sudden growth. He continues, saying that Katsuki is stifling his own potential but Katsuki interrupts and says that if he has to work with Izuku, then he'd rather lose. Disappointed with his students reply, All Might prepares to finish him off. Izuku swiftly comes to the rescue and punches Katsuki away, telling him not to say he'd rather lose. Izuku carries Katsuki away down an alleyway until Katsuki makes him stop. He tells Katsuki to at least try working together because saying he'd rather lose is against Katsuki's nature.

  <p key="64b7f64c-2ed2-4b4e-adc3-9c9736cc719e">
   Angered, Katsuki blasts the piece of wall next to Izuku's head and says that they can't avoid fighting All Might. Katsuki believes their only chance is to blast him at point blank range with all the firepower they have and then run as fast as they possibly can.
   When All Might passes by their alleyway, Katsuki makes himself known and blasts All Might from behind. All while struggling to come to terms with his decision to work with Izuku. Once Katsuki gets All Might's attention, he calls for Izuku to appear behind the number one hero, having given him a grenadier bracer beforehand. Izuku pulls the pin from the gauntlet and blasts All Might. He questions how Katsuki has been using such a powerful weapon and Katsuki orders them to run for the escape gate together.
  </p>
  <p key="78640cef-c979-479e-90bc-3ffd1fcaaf92">
   While fleeing, Katsuki notices that All Might destroyed the entire area from their initial entrance to the escape gate earlier. Izuku comments that All Might isn't chasing them and perhaps got knocked out by the explosion. Katsuki tells him that he's an idiot for believing that and gets taken by surprise when All Might suddenly catches up to them with his blistering speed and breaks both of the grenadier bracers. All Might knees Katsuki into a building and grabs Izuku. Katsuki quickly recovers and rushes All Might again, only for him to slam Izuku into him and subsequently pin them both down.
   While immobilized, Katsuki mulls over All Might's overwhelming power and admits he is the worlds greatest hero.
  </p>
  <p key="cb8db2b5-e5f7-4491-beb4-8e2271a78365">
   All Might dissects their earlier plan and states that the fight is over because he's destroyed the grenadier bracers. Katsuki demands he stops talking and blasts All Might with a super explosion similar to the one he used against Ochaco in their Sports Festival fight. Then he grabs Izuku and warns him he's going flying. He throws Izuku towards the escape gate only for All Might to smash him into a nearby bus.
  </p>
  <p key="59811c42-9c03-401b-b554-f340f436681e">
   Katsuki rushes over to distract All Might and admits to himself that it was foolish to believe he could best All Might without taking any risks, and uses a second super explosion against him. Izuku moves slowly towards the gate and Katsuki yells for him to hurry. Katsuki continues to blast All Might with super explosions so that Izuku can make for the escape point which would force All Might to stop him. All Might does just that, giving Katsuki the opening they were looking for. However, All Might avoids Katsuki's attack and slams him into the ground. Falling out of consciousness, Katsuki bites All Might's hand and says he refuses to believe that he can't win even if he's up against All Might.
  </p>
  <p key="41d6d88f-45ee-4e5c-bcc1-1c233faf4191">
   Surprisingly, Izuku does not escape; instead, he rushes back to help Katsuki. Izuku smiles and punches All Might in the face, asking his mentor to move aside. While All Might is suffering from slight recoil, Izuku grabs Katsuki's unconscious body and gets through the escape gate.

  <p key="07c82757-2aea-43c2-a4fd-f372e0fcd960">
   Katsuki and Izuku pass the exam and are taken to Recovery Girl's office to receive treatment. Recovery Girl scolds All Might for not restraining himself during the fight. Recovery Girl says that Katsuki likely won't wake up for a while and they should both rest with her. All Might muses over Katsuki's ability to smile in the face of adversity and says that he cannot wait to see how much stronger Katsuki will become much stronger in the future.

Katsuki uses Stun Grenade to blind it, but he notices something wrong and stops attacking. Izuku arrives shortly afterward and sees the praying mantis attacking Katsuki, but it phases through him. Katsuki generates a huge explosion that makes

   An infuriated Katsuki shouts to the girl if she is mocking him, and says that he is aiming to be the next Number 1 hero, so he doesn't have time for pranks. Izuku restrains Katsuki out of fear that he may hurt the kids, and Mahoro and Katsuma scurry out of there while Katsuki struggles to get Izuku off him. The next morning, Katsuki overhears Katsuma apologizing to Izuku, and learns that Mahoro thinks that hero work is dangerous, so she wants to discourage him from becoming one. He also listens to how Mahoro and Katsuma's mother passed away when they were young and that their father is always working, which is why Mahoro is overprotective of her brother.

   Later in the day, Katsuki picked up the phone in Class 1-A's hero office, and hears Mahoro trying to warn them that villains have arrived. Katsuki doesn't believe her and tries to hang up, but Izuku takes the phone to listen, only for the phone service to be cut off. After word spreads that villains have indeed invaded Nabu Island, Katsuki, Eijiro, and Denki head over to the shopping district to intercept the villain. The three rescue Yuga and Minoru just in time, and engage against

He is healed by Recovery Girl, and stays with his class to repair the damage done on the island until the Public Safety Commission suspends the program and orders them to be sent home. With the island being repaired by the military and the heroes, Class 1-A boards a ferry to leave. As they leave, they see Katsuma and Mahoro, who are reunited with their father, saying their goodbyes to Class 1-A.

   On the occasion of an important mission organized by the

The test is that in a time limit of three minutes, they must all land an attack to Endeavor, so they can participate in the mission of global scale. Katsuki loves the idea of having the chance to fight Japan's Number 1 hero.

   As soon as the test begins, Katsuki is the first to attack him, trying to go for an attack from above because of Endeavor's blindspot, but Endeavor just blasts him away, with Katsuki noting his incredible reflexes. After neither Shoto nor Izuku manage to hit him, the three students attack him at once, but Endeavor use his Hellflame Quirk to blast them away. The examiners ask the hero to go easy on them as they don't expect them to be a match for him, but Endeavor replies to them not to underestimate his trainees.
  </p>
  <p key="6d581e38-f7cd-432f-8fb7-e61b0edba4e1">
   The three students get up, more determined than ever not to fail again. Using his explosions to move faster, Katsuki gets behind Endeavor and attempts to hit him, which he just barely dodges. Shoto shoots fire directly at him which is enough for Izuku to land an attack on him before the time limit expires. Although they've passed the test, Katsuki is frustrated because he didn't get the chance to defeat Endeavor, declaring he would've got him if it went on for longer.

   Due to the nature of the mission they are going to participate in, they are taken to a special room to create stealth-oriented suits.

Shoto reminds Katsuki to hold back as most of the members are Quirkless, as Katsuki utilizes his Stun Grenade to blind the members and Shoto freezing them to immobilize their movement, with Katsuki annoyed by Shoto's word of caution. After a few minutes of fighting, all cultists are defeated with no hero casualties, however Flect Turn is missing and the Trigger Bombs are nowhere. The situation is the same in the branches of other countries, so the Association director orders all the teams to be placed on standby.

   Quirk, but Katsuki dodges the blast and counters with his own explosive Quirk, defeating the robber. Shoto also defeats the other robber, but they lose track of Izuku when he chases a third one.

  <p key="aec594c4-ebb9-4d3d-b39c-716ddb0dc9d3">
   After the robbery fiasco, Katsuki returns to the hotel, with Endeavor reprimanding him and Shoto for disobeying direct orders to standby and instead chase after a petty robbery. Katsuki sarcastically comments in response that they never learned to assign importance to jobs during their Work Studies, a comment that annoys Endeavor.
  </p>
  <p key="c65a9ef1-4e1a-4cea-b8e8-164fcea6d547">
   At that moment, Izuku contacts Shoto, and as he's about to tell him what had happened to him,
   Clair Voyance
   brings them to the television where the news agency publicly announces to the world that Izuku is accused of a mass murder of twelve people, much to Katsuki's, Shoto's, and Endeavor's shock. Shoto tells Izuku what he just saw on the news, and advises him to stay hidden while they try to clarify what happened.
  </p>
  <p key="3154b9d4-9cf4-43cb-9443-fe8971dfd867">
   Shoto later receives a hard coded message from Izuku telling him that he is heading to the neighboring country of Klayd. Clair also reports that near the place where Izuku was chasing the thief, there was a car accident caused, driven by a Humarise deserter who was attacked, and that the briefcase with the stolen jewels was also found nearby. Realizing what is happening, Shoto takes Katsuki with him. As soon as they leave the hotel, several policemen attempt to trail them, but both manage to give him the slip.

  <p key="ccf1e951-72e5-4a66-94c7-9891c789c8bf">
   The two board the train to the Otheon-Klayd border, and during the trip they recap the whole situation, coming to the conclusion that during the chase, Izuku and the thief he was chasing, mistakenly took a briefcase related to Humarise, thinking it was the one with the jewels, and that the reason why the police persecute them is because several of its members are allied with the criminal organization.
  </p>
  <p key="171c9052-0e55-4e08-9f89-9e48860ce264">
   Katsuki and Shoto arrive at the border, which is guarded by a large police force. Suddenly they see a battle in the mountains near the border, and when they go there, they see that Izuku and the person accompanying him are being attacked from a helicopter by two Humarise agents,

However, before allowing herself to be captured, Beros jumps off a cliff before the helicopter crashes, an action that leaves everyone present stunned.

  <p key="1a9b02c4-1717-413c-a98f-6be3f7466a15">
   Once the battle is over, Izuku meets with Shoto and Katsuki, introducing the two to Rody, as they all catch up on the situation. Izuku realizes that the battle caused a secret compartment in the briefcase to open. After getting far enough away from the battlefield, they find the compartment concealed a small puzzle-box.
  </p>
  <p key="dfc6674f-958a-4de2-a6fe-3dce7020a5c3">
   The three students try to solve it without success, and Katsuki ops to destroy the box to know what is inside, but Rody remembers that it is exactly like one

   The four decide to cross the border to Klayd and investigate the information it contains. Izuku is shocked at how many files he doesn't know what to do, but Katsuki looks for the newest file, finding in it an audio of
   Alan Kay
   , a Humarise deserter. Alan reveals that Flect Turn had prepared a trap in order to eliminate the world's top Heroes, using the Trigger Bombs. Fortunately, he reveals that the device is a key that defuses all the bombs, created by his colleague, Eddie Soul, at the cost of his life.
  </p>
  <p key="c2b7f15c-4d4f-4d1b-91b8-f5f5a56c350a">
   However, the situation becomes desperate as Humarise broadcasts to the entire world that they have planted over twenty-five countries with the Trigger bombs and plan to detonate all of them in two hours, creating massive panic and hysteria in the major cities being targeted.
  </p>
  <p key="ffb76d49-a14d-402a-9adb-8bab3d4de13d">
   With no backup and running out of time, the four of them decide to take the disarming device to disable the bombs. Katsuki is able to figure out the exact location of Humarise's true home base in the SD card, and with Rody flying them there on a plane, they head out to shut down the bombs. The three heroes gear up in their original costumes and launch a direct assault on Humarise's base.
  </p>
  <p key="f5db28d5-c4ee-4192-ae7b-bf4b55731e9b">
   Dozens of Humarise's followers start shooting at them once they see them, but Katsuki retaliates with his Quirk blasts, defeating several of them. Once they land, Katsuki takes care of the rest of the soldiers while Izuku and Shoto enter the base to stop the countdown. Once he defeats the last of the defenders, Katsuki faces a new threat, the
   Serpenters Twins
   .
  </p>
  <p key="18e7c56c-3d15-409a-939b-b9dba6dbfeff">
   Katsuki questions why they are following Humarise given that they are Quirk users. The Serpenters claim that they will be spared in the upcoming Quirk cull, so Katsuki replies that it just means they are opportunistic cowards, and starts attacking them.
  </p>
  <p key="16370ddd-0ee4-44f0-bda0-7448662de9c9">
   The Twins prove to be very dangerous opponents, as they are not only fast and agile, but also their
   Sword Kill
   Quirks allow them to cut through even the biggest explosions. Katsuki is wounded and slashed several times, but continues to attack them, until he manages to outsmart them, causing them to become trapped under the rubble of a column he knocks down.
  </p>
  <p key="0fd8b0a3-2378-48ef-b94b-d79e86919c03">
   Unfortunately, the Serpenters inject themselves with Trigger to break out of the rubble, becoming even more powerful than before. They easily overwhelm Katsuki, slashing and slicing him mercilessly, while he student is barely able to fight back. He is about to die from his injuries, yet he refuses to give up and in the end he finds a way to defeat them.
  </p>
  <p key="543eaa8e-9225-46a0-9182-e3f011c7a4e8">
   After being slashed several times, Katsuki manages to grab their bladed whips and slams the twins against the wall, attacking them with his Grenadier Bracers to make sure they are well embedded, and defeats them definitively with his Super Move: Howitzer Impact. Having achieved victory, Katsuki stands tall, right arm in the air with thumbs down, before collapsing because of the extenuation and blood loss, losing consciousness.

   During the time he is unconscious, his other teammates achieved their goals, with Izuku defeating Flect Turn and Rody managing to deactivates the Trigger Bombs Control System just in time, saving the lives of millions of people in the world. Humarise is dismantled and all of its members are sent to prison.

   Katsuki, Izuku, Rody, and Shoto are rescued and taken to a hospital, where they remain until they recover from their injuries. Recovery Girl herself goes to the hospital to heal them using her Quirk, much to Katsuki's chagrin. After their mission was successfully completed, the Otheon team leaves the country, as they notice Izuku saying his goodbyes to Rody.

   Upon returning to class, Class 1-A heads to Ground Alpha to demonstrate what they learned from their work study experiences. In the locker room, Katsuki hits Izuku in the head with his mask out of disgust, as Izuku's control over Blackwhip was praised by his classmates. Outside, the class is surprised to see that All Might will be teaching the class, as Shota has been urgently called to

   The Endeavor Agency trio demonstrate at last, with Katsuki showing off his improved abilities, Shoto his enhanced speed, and Izuku his improved control over Blackwhip. Later in the Teachers Lounge, All Might meets with Katsuki and Izuku. He congratulates the two on their improvements, and places a notebook on the table, which contains All Might's research into the past One For All users.

At first, Katsuki looks down on the original users and their Quirks as being weak, but All Might tells him that All For One killed them as soon as he could since they defied his will, leaving them with no choice but to pass on their Quirks. Katsuki asks Izuku what Quirk he will unlock next, and Izuku answers with

   As Izuku trains with his classmates to prepare his Quirks, Katsuki assists him with a training exercise called "Catch Kacchan With Blackwhip" to catch him with Blackwhip, only for Izuku to lose every time with Katsuki's explosions leaving an afro on his head. Later, Katsuki tells All Might that he can't keep his secrets forever, and All Might tells him that great power puts others at risk and it isn't just the wicked who seek power. Katsuki questions All Might about leaving out some of the information in the notebook, and dodging the subject when he asked him previously.
  </p>
  <p key="00801f36-753d-45a4-bc20-9559cbf2dd7e">
   All Might reasons that they're both worried for Izuku due to his own insecurities, and Katsuki replies that he ignored his own weaknesses so he bullied him in the past. All Might asks if Katsuki is doing this to atone and he says Izuku won't see it that way, but All Might soothes him by comparing his relationship with Izuku to his own relationship with Endeavor, saying he'll get a chance to talk eventually.

   During Endeavor's battle with Tomura, he and Deku both overhear Endeavor mention "One For All" over the comms, realizing that Tomura will now be directly targeting Deku. Seeing Deku starting to worry, Katsuki tells him that everyone will want to look out for him, since being a Hero means protecting everyone, and he understands the safety of the people is their top priority, so they need to leave. The two make up an excuse to their fellow students about forgetting something, as they contact Endeavor to tell him Tomura is going after Deku, with Katsuki yelling that he'll crush him.

   As the two continue moving forward toward an abandoned area of the city, Deku suddenly asks why Katsuki is with him, causing him to snap back that in a situation like this, he's the only one who understands quickly enough to act fast enough. Deku thanks for his help, but Katsuki retorts he isn't doing it for him, having a score to settle with Tomura from getting kidnapped and leading to All Might's retirement; One For All is just the bait. He then starts to think about how much Deku has grown through their internship as well as All Might's training, noting that no matter how much he continues to climb, he'll make sure to always work to stay ahead.

   Tomura finally catches up to Deku and Katsuki, nearly touching the former to steal One For All, but they are saved at the last minute by Gran Torino, who takes them to a safe spot.
   Deku tries to introduce Katsuki to Gran Torino, who reveals All Might already told him that he knows about One For All. Katsuki asks why he dropped them off so far away, as he explains that not only is Tomura's Decay so dangerous that touching debris could disintegrate you, but that he also possesses incredible power and speed, on top of All For One's Quirk and additional Quirks, telling them to let the Pro Heroes handle the mess, especially now that they have Eraser Head using his Erasure to weaken him. He also reminds Deku that him losing One For All would be the "worst case scenario".

   Suddenly, to all three of their shock, a hoard of Nomu, dubbed the "Near High-Ends", suddenly emerge from the wreckage and begin to attack the incoming Heroes arriving to backup the team currently fighting Tomura. Gran Torino leaves to assist Endeavor and Ryukyu, but seeing the Heroes undermanned, and seeing Eraser Head in danger, Deku and Katsuki blast their way back to the battlefield, with Deku stopping Tomura and Katsuki declaring it's their turn to save him.

   After Deku tells them they need all the help they can get, and that losing their teacher is the real "worst case scenario", Katsuki unleashes an AP Shot: Auto-Cannon on Tomura, but he disregards them as mere fireworks as they hit him. Deku tries using Blackwhip to hold him back but Tomura pulls him closer while telling Katsuki face-to-face that he isn't interested in him at the moment. Endeavor returns and blasts Tomura away from the two students, asking them where Shoto is, and answering it's just them present.

   Endeavor tells Deku and Katsuki that they can act without his direction in this situation, but he wants them to support Eraser Head and protect each other. After being attacked by both Endeavor and Gran Torino, Tomura manages to make a straight dash towards Deku but is surprised by Katsuki appearing above him as he yells out that Deku was baiting him out so he could unleash a huge explosion from his gauntlets, distracting him long enough for Endeavor to go at him with  a punch to the gut.
  </p>
  <p key="6821e20b-b0ef-4be9-b9cf-92c6ec81252f">
   Even after all the punishment brought toward him, Tomura still stands and continues to resist. During their scuffle, Gran Torino is severely injured by Tomura, while Deku and Ryukyu manage to restrain him from going after Eraser Head.
   However, unknowingly to everyone, Tomura was in possession of two

Katsuki manages to destroy one of them, but fails to stop the other as it hits his leg, but Eraser Head manages to cut it off before the effect could take place. Shoto then arrives to help them keep him at bay, but he manages to reach Eraser Head and injure him enough for him to blink, giving Tomura all his Quirks back.

   Katsuki gets increasingly irritated at being unable to do anything to help, and just as Tomura has the chance to Decay all the Heroes in his vicinity, Deku suddenly activates Float while using Blackwhip to carry all of the Heroes out of range.
   Katsuki worriedly yells to Deku to keep his distance, but the latter tells him that he is the only one who can stop Tomura from reaching the ground. As the two clash, Katsuki worries that Deku has a high risk of dying whether by Tomura's hand or expanding his body with his own Quirks. He comes up with a plan using both Shoto and Endeavor, flying the two up to help Deku, with Katsuki thinking about how he used to believe that One For All was a cursed power until seeing how useful it was when All Might and Deku used it for their heroic deeds, while also witnessing the intense self-harm the full power of the Quirk is doing to him right now. He throws Endeavor to Tomura, unleashing a Prominence Burn that nearly defeats him, until All For One surprisingly possesses Tomura's body, with the villain unleashing tendrils in order to attack Deku and steal One For All. Without thinking, Katsuki intercepts the attack and saves Deku's life, just like he did for him so long ago.

   Katsuki tells the shocked Deku not to play hero all by himself, and his falling self is caught by Shoto. Enraged by Tomura hurting his allies and friends, Deku snaps and breaks his way through to Tomura, accidentally giving him the chance to steal One For All.
   Tomura, however, is unable to steal One For All, and the action stuns both him and Deku.

  <p key="8d36365d-ca83-4a63-b112-4fc1c61d075f">
   Dynamight taunts Deku's current appearance, how he now looks completely different, also mentioning how he heard he's unlocked the Quirks from the 4th and 6th users now. Deku thanks everyone for coming, before using

   to make an escape. Uravity recognizes it as the Quirk of the 6th user, as Dynamight uses his
   Land Mine Blast
   to blast away the smoke, asking if Deku believes that now h'es one of the big-shots, if they're all just a bunch of "NPCs" to him.

  <p key="da47c62e-6758-4d27-9867-4e12957aeb15">
   Deku continues trying to make his escape, being tossed from building to building as each of the Class 1-A members attempt to restrain and reason with him, as he refuses to listen. With him about to make a getaway using
   Faux 100 Percent
   to blast into the sky, Class 1-A unveil their final plan: combining Pinky's
   Acidman
   and Shoto's Flashfreeze Heatwave to launch Dynamight off Shoto's ice ramp-up to Deku, pushing further with Uravity's Zero Gravity. Dynamight blows through the air and admits to himself there is so much he needs to say to Deku, but right now the only one who can withstand such intense speed is Ingneium, whom he launches straight at Deku using his
   Blasting Speed Turbo Cluster
   .
  </p>
  <p key="00c60905-3e1c-4f0e-a378-a2066ce69b9e">
   Ingenium manages to grab ahold of Deku's hand, who finally gives in as they are released from the air and are caught by Red Riot on the ground. As the rest of the class catches up, Deku still continues to resist and insist it is too dangerous for him to be around everyone. Dynamight approaches him and asks if he remembers what he said when he got stabbed by Tomura during the War. When Deku says he doesn’t, Dynamight reminds him that he said “stop trying to win this on your own”, and after he said that, he felt he had to tell him that his body moved on his own when he got stabbed.
  </p>
  <p key="49e1474e-a0ba-4767-9dfc-590d7329724a">
   Dynamight admits he looked down on Deku because he was Quirkless, and therefore he felt he should be far behind him, but the truth was, he always felt he was above him. He says he couldn't accept the way he was, which led to him bullying him over the years and trying to prove his superiority, but after entering U.A., he kept losing, so started trying to understand Deku's strengths and his weaknesses. He proceeds to tell Deku that even if it doesn’t change anything, he has to speak his current truth: He apologizes to him for everything he had done to him up until now, even calling him "Izuku" for the first time.
  </p>
  <p key="9cdde2e6-42db-4697-ad94-abd65e5c9503">
   Dynamight’s words snap Deku to his senses as he continues that his choices weren’t misguided, but he can’t handle it by himself anymore, that if he encounters a hurdle, he can rely on his friends to help him, and the only way to surpass All Might is for everyone to protect U.A. and the civilians together. Deku weakly collapses and apologizes for what he said about everyone not being able to keep up with him, which Dynamight accepts as he catches him.
  </p>
  <p key="f269540d-121e-4a81-a55a-d5c87179e9a0">
   Class 1-A return to U.A. with Izuku, now equipped with the "U.A. Barrier", where they find the front of the school filled with a crowd of civilians protesting Izuku's entry, knowing that he is being targeted by Tomura and believing it will endanger them. The Heroes are unable to get through to the crowd until Ochaco makes an impassioned speech toward the civilians to let Izuku stay, which everyone becomes affected by. During the speech, Katsuki turns to Izuku and reminds him that he and the others will step up for him if he can't handle something on his own.
  </p>
  <p key="c23f6fbb-75ce-4b14-a661-c1097d4b661d">
   By the conclusion of Ochaco's pleas, Izuku breaks down in exhaustion and relief, with the crowd agreeing to let him stay and help, as Katsuki, Class 1-A, and the civilians escort Izuku inside.
   The boys immediately rush Izuku to the bath, stripping and washing him down before getting in themselves. Katsuki yells at everyone to scrub Izuku first before throwing him into the bath straight away, hopping in himself, as Fumikage takes note that even after his heartfelt apology, he still hasn't changed. Katsuki, however, reminds everyone that his goal to become number one hasn't changed, which makes everyone his rivals still, including Izuku, who he tries to refrain from calling him "Deku." Izuku, however, tells Katsuki that he doesn't have to force himself and can still call him Deku.
  </p>
  <p key="d4126330-ec73-46b2-a06e-4a9721a39c28">
   After getting out of the bath, Class 1-A is visited by All Might, where he and Izuku apologize and make up before he heads back out. Izuku proceeds to fall asleep, while the class discuss what to do about the situation with the civilians. Kyoka thinks about Shoto's words about the evacuees not having a full change of heart yet, dragging Denki, Fumikage, Katsuki, and Momo closer to her, stating that just like the last time there were other people that regarded them with apprehension, they need to do something to reassure them and bring smiles to their faces, just like they did at the Culture Festival. Class 1-A comes back together, as they declare they won’t just bring the world back to how it was, but to make it a better place than before, and do it all together.

   Two days later, Class 1-A learn that during this time, Tomura had fought American No. 1 Hero,

   , thanks to her actions, the Quirk acted like a virus within his body, destroying several of his Quirks and delaying his procedure by about a week. All Might informs all this to the class, telling them that this is now their perfect time to prepare for the inevitable all-out war.
  </p>
  <p key="ac8c23e0-d9b9-486c-9691-d17edde4afb2">
   Katsuki immediately yells at All Might that they've already been preparing, with the rest of the class revealing that since the War, they've continued their training with the Wild, Wild Pussycats, all with the intention to fight alongside Izuku until Tomura is defeated. Izuku says that Katsuki and the others agreed to practice with him to help master One For All, but Katsuki just barks back at him, like he usually does, claiming he only wants to test out his new Cluster moves on him, to Izuku's shock. The rest of the class each respond with enthusiasm as they all prepare to go out and train, with All Might looking on proud and satisfied.
  </p>
  <p key="3f4c5fdb-0964-4638-ac56-38d345079a5e">
   Out in the courtyard, the class trains their Quirks, with Katsuki and Izuku sparring between each other. Katsuki talks about how he's learnt to “build up and release” from their internship, but now he’s focused on saving up a bunch of sweat. So rather than one big Explosion, he can create a barrage of explosions at once to power his new Cluster technique. Izuku also realizes that's why he stays in his winter suit, so he can sweat faster.
  </p>
  <p key="424f5bd7-a2ca-4b34-b903-2c490ccf86c5">
   Denki discusses with Minoru about how with Tomura and All For One currently weakened and Gigantomachia still sedated, the fight should be easier for them, but Katsuki tells them three reasons why they’re wrong. First is that even after being able to locate the research facilities and hideouts, the Heroes were never able to track down All For One himself, calling "Ol' Nutsack Face" a champ at “hide-and-seek”, so they are unlikely to find him again.
  </p>
  <p key="b321ee9a-4efe-4b74-bae9-ea2ec8d834f3">
   Momo adds the second thing, which is that Tomura was incomplete in the previous battle, and now they’re only working with half of their Heroes, which Katsuki agrees with. He says the last point is that the villains will be the ones to decide when the battle starts, as even if the Search Quirk was destroyed, they’re the ones with the edge to start the battle, which is why they're all focusing on calling up everybody possible to help.
  </p>
  <p key="ae89143e-8f6a-4dbd-b305-b1ab90a39d65">
   Shortly afterwards, he and the rest of the class receive the devastating news that Izuku had just captured the Aoyama Family, learning that they have been spies for All For One, and Yuga was the traitor who isolated the class at the U.S.J. and revealed the location of their training camp. Restraining them in the AV room, he and the other class members refuse to back down from the news despite Nezu's request, all in stunned and tears of Yuga's betrayal. Among everyone's intense reactions, Katsuki calmly replies how it's a "small world" another one of them started out Quirkless, referring to Izuku. He listens to Yuga's desperation that drove him to despair, followed by Izuku's pleading to let Yuga still help them, figuring Izuku's plan.
  </p>
  <p key="e09ca34f-fd8e-4302-a097-518e97fa574f">
   The rest of the class quickly realize that they could have Yuga help deceive All For One and "steer the villains" into the fight, and when questioned considering his betrayal, say they want him to help them so they can more easily move on and forgive him. For his part, Katsuki quips that due to all the things he went through because of him, five good Howitzer blasts will be enough to make them even, which Hanta awkwardly responds to.
  </p>
  <p key="467d08e6-18f2-4613-b3f3-8e39ba30ab86">
   Shota then appears on a tablet screen, taking full responsibility and reveals that he has an idea, which Class 1-A, the U.A. Staff, and Police Force hear while the Aoyama Family's ears have been covered. Naomasa then has the Aoyama Family escorted back to their HQ, telling everyone not to say a word to anyone else about the plan, while he and the rest of the class looking on sullenly. Back at Heights Alliance, Katsuki and the class take a breather, before getting ready to gear back up, as he and everyone, with fire and rage in their eyes over the betrayal, prepare to bring All For One down once and for all.
   He and the rest of his class form their "Search Squad", heading out to hunt down the remaining villains.
  </p>
  <p key="2539c7a2-b7f3-4cd7-b82b-6199ab29d71b">
   Later, Class 1-A return to the dorms, unable to make any progress in their search for the villains. Just as they are taking their break, All Might, Naomasa, and Nezu arrive, informing them all about their secret finalized plans for the upcoming second War.
   They explain how they believe All For One is keeping watch over them using the Search Quirk, and Katsuki realizes that them running themselves ragged will allow them to draw All For One out more easily, believing them all to be exhausted. In order to catch him off guard, they are going to have Yuga lure All For One to a specific location, and to make sure he can't detect their lies, they are going to use Hitoshi Shinso's newly improved Brainwashing Quirk to get the family to talk without any ill intent in their voices.
  </p>
  <p key="a8166829-e0ae-45f6-80fc-fd4399db97aa">
   The next day, Nezu announces to the civilians that Tomura will make his big move in 4 days, with Class 1-A moving outside of the U.A. barrier to began prioritizing their safety. The students say their goodbyes to everyone, with Katsuki saying goodbye to his family members, though his mother was very persistent over his cocky attitude, much to his annoyance. He moves out of Heights Alliance and into its upgraded makeshift fortress called "Troy". Inside the dorms after unpacking, Katsuki accompanies Eijiro and Tenya into Shoto's room to check in on him. Shoto thinks about Toya and how he doesn’t even know his favorite food, which Katsuki quips is probably udon, leaving Shoto to respond he wouldn’t mind making him sit down to eat with him sometime.

  <p key="00647817-2ec8-4ded-88cf-fb6fa78d28a2">
   As the plan begins on the day of the operation, Katsuki remains with the rest of Class 1-A until Izuku makes contact with Yuga at the location on the outskirts of the Troy dorms. All For One is successfully lured out, and using Search to sense that no other Heroes are around, summons the Paranormal Liberation Front to overwhelm Izuku. Just as planned, all the Heroes themselves are warped to the battlefield thanks to Neito Monoma copying Kurogiri's Warp Gate, and begin their all-out assault.
  </p>
  <p key="22943ec9-bbcc-4c8a-ad68-9ccab62d1cf1">
   The "Troy" defense system is activated, causing gigantic metal barriers to rise from the ground and trap the villains. They are able to break free, but the delay gave the Heroes just enough time for the next part of the plan: to push all the villains into individual Warp Gates to separate them. Katsuki fires a barrage of AP Machine Guns to force the villains back, as he and Izuku prepare to follow suit into one of them. However, suddenly, Izuku is caught off guard when a whip from Himiko Toga grabs onto him, dragging him into another gate, leaving him confused. He enters the Warp Gate, sending him to the now flying U.A. fortress, where Tomura Shigaraki also is, exclaiming to Best Jeanist that something went wrong and Izuku isn't there.
  </p>
  <p key="bffc18f2-6a6f-4bd5-a66d-62d8ff9d16d5">
   Now within the extensive barrier, Katsuki, Tamaki, Nejire, Edgeshot, Mirko, and Best Jeanist prepare to fight Tomura, even though Izuku isn't there. Tomura starts to attack, but finds himself repelled by the fortress, and electrical barrier surrounding them, with them revealing that the Floating Fortress was designed to specifically take Tomura down, alongside the amount of heroes cooperating within to maintain it. Tomura prepares to attack the arena with a shockwave, however Katsuki mockingly reminds him about what happened in Jaku, revealing that outside the arena, Neito has him in his sight using Erasure to erase his Quirks once again, accompanied by Eraser Head and Manual.
  </p>
  <p key="1866d97a-9004-4149-9855-41cb98c0cf70">
   Ultimately, the plan is still at a disadvantage without Izuku there, and even worse, Tomura's left hand suddenly begins to transform into a monstrous blob of fingers. Katsuki is unable to explain the nature of the attack to Mirko, just as a constructive mass of fingers is directly thrown toward her.
   Although Mirko was able to survive the attack, the grotesque swarm of fingers from Tomura is revealed to be the “growth” from the body, just as is the case with his hair or nails, making his body trying to adapt to his ever-evolving Quirks, the form leading to the next step of their superhuman society: Doctor

  <p key="1cbb2e58-3981-4b34-921f-15850ce8b282">
   After Katsuki and Mirko both make it out of the attack range to regroup, the two proceed to argue with each other over who's in charge, until Best Jeanist tells them to stay focused. The Heroes all figure that they can’t warp Izuku to the U.A. Flying Sky Fortress, as Neito is unable to use two Quirks at the same time, so activating Warp Gate again would require at least ten seconds without Erasure, and the moment Erasure is undone, Tomura will be able to use Decay through each of his endlessly growing wave of fingers, finishing them all. Despite the circumstances, Katsuki and the rest of the Heroes are determined to fight and defeat the new Tomura, even without One For All.
