   In Word Puzzle, you can choose from two different modes with minor differences from each other. Word Puzzle A will give you a clue to the answer in the Japanese language, whereas Word Puzzle B will not give such a clue, making it harder. Next, the player chooses from six different categories. Following this,

   will ask the player to spell out a word chosen by her. The difficulty is that the player must spell it using the rules of the English language instead of spelling it out in their native language of Japanese. To do this, the player will control Popeye and make him move under a letter (of the English language). Once you find the letter you wish to choose, then you must press the A button to enter it. Failing 10 times will result in a game over. Each time you make a mistake,

   along a clothesline a small distance. Making ten mistakes thus causes Swee'Pea to fall off it. If you finish the word with less than 10 mistakes, you win. The six categories you can choose from are: Animals, Country, Food, Sports, Science and Others.

   The Word Catcher option is a two-player competitive game where Popeye and Brutus try to spell out English words from letters dropped by Olive from above. The first player to complete five words, wins.
