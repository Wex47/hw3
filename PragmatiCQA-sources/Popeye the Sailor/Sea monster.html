   By far the most common type of sea monster that Popeye and others have encountered. They come in a variety of forms, but mostly resemble gigantic, green, serpentine reptiles similar to dragons that have ridges along their backs and may usually have fins. Others may resemble aquatic finned dinosaurs or not even look like serpents at all, such as the ones that resemble iguana-like dinosaurs but are still referred to as sea serpents. Sea monsters tend to make their homes in the waters around islands, such as the vicinity of Popeye's

   Abnormally large species of cephalopods that resemble octopuses but often have the beaks of a squid and may be able walk on land, usually referred to as sea monsters by Popeye and others, have occasionally appeared as antagonists. This is likely due to giant cephalopods being associated with the Kraken, an ancient sea monster said to resemble such species, specifically, a giant squid.
