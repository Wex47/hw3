   are out for a drive. While listening to the radio, a breaking news bulletin announces that a flying saucer has been spotted. Meanwhile, in the UFO, the
   Martian
   robot is ordered to find a human to abduct for a sinister
   alien
   examination. After the robot spots Olive via a screen, he captures her, and Popeye sets out to rescue his girlfriend: he lassoes up to the flying saucer to try and get Olive back. Meeting the robot, Popeye demands the return of Olive Oyl, which at first makes the robot think Popeye was asking for motor oil, and he squirts some at him, but Popeye specifically tells the robot that he wants his girlfriend back. Refusing to leave and defying the robot, Popeye gets pulled into the flying saucer.

   As the robot mentions that he intends to bring Popeye and Olive to the planet Mars, Popeye puts up a fight. The robot pulls out his raygun and shoots beams at the

   and returning fire with spinach rays, shown to be even stronger than the robot's beams, as they greatly affect him. The spinach rays change the robot from evil to good, and the latter happily floats out of his flying saucer and starts singing cheerfully. Olive praises Popeye for stopping the robot and saving her. As Popeye begins piloting the flying saucer, he and Olive see on the screen that the formerly-evil robot, still singing, is sitting on Popeye's car which is somehow driving itself.
