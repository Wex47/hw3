   However, real world countries still existed and would be used as references or visited but it would seem as though major events that happened in the real world, such as crises and wars, did not occur in this setting, or at least in Popeye's hometown these situations did not affect them, other than possibly the Great Depression, the League of Nations and the Prohibition (which was mentioned numerous times).

Popeye and his friends were shown as regularly living in small little rustic houses close to the sea and the town itself according to maps as drawn by Sagendorf was actually an island in an unknown archipelago that was presumably close to America and

This was used to reflect the difficult times of the Great Depression as well as Popeye's difficulty as a lower class man. The town he lived in was usually portrayed as being a small neighborhood close to the sea or somewhere in the country, but most commonly it was a small city near the port that usually looked run-down.

   the town is also identified as Sweethaven notably in the opening animation by the huge sign spelling "SWEET HAVEN" on a hill, not unlike the Hollywood Sign. Again shown as a small seaside town, as in the earlier film, in this setting later in Popeye's life it is seen to have grown and modernized considerably. It now resembles the somewhat more urbanized locale from the old comics and cartoons, yet slightly more so due to the presence of many new attractions meant to appeal to a newer generation of kids.
