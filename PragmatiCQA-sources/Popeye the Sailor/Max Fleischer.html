   (the original model for Koko, and credited director of most of the studio's output) began their careers at J. R. Bray's studio, establishing their own concern in 1921; following early failed attempts at self-distribution,
   Paramount Studios
   became Fleischer's distributor in 1927.

   The hallmark of the Fleischer cartoons as they moved into the sound area was rubber-hose movements, with characters limbs stretching and wiggling, a reliance on pop sounds, and a use of New York settings, dialects, and atmosphere. 1930 saw the screen debut of the studio's biggest star,

   . These cartoons thus departed from the original strip, but set many standards for nearly all later incarnations in print and film.

   As Walt Disney and later Leon Schlesinger of Looney Tunes fame arose as competition, the popularity of the Fleischer Studios cartoons gradually waned, while Fleischer continued to experiment with technical methods, notably the "setback", through which cels of characters were photographed before elaborate three dimensional backgrounds, which could be rotated to create a panoramic illusion. In 1938, Max and Dave Fleischer moved their studio to Florida, where they produced their first feature-length film, a loose adaptation of

   , as well as an assortment of color shorts, the thriving Popeye series, and the final Betty Boop entries. Beginning in 1941, the Fleischers adapted another comics strongman to animation, producing a series of nine
   Superman
   shorts. They also produced their second feature,

   in 1942, with Max Fleischer's son-in-law Seymour Kneitel taking over as primary director. The brothers now separated, as Dave Fleischer moved to Hollywood to head Columbia Pictures' cartoon studio that year. Max Fleischer joined the Jam Handy studio in Detroit, working on commercials and training films, and produced the first cinematic adaptation of
