   Axle is a no-nonsense robot who is loyal to his protocol and always tries to do what is best for his son by making sure he behaves like a proper hard-working robot. Cam is a surprisingly free-spirited robot who always wants to play games and have fun, making him more human-like than other mechanical men, and this often makes him quite mischievous as he would rather play games than work. This often is a source of much conflict between the two, but both care for one another like any good father and son would.
