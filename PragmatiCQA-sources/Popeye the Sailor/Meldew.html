   in 1959. Much like his better-known mooching cousin, Meldew took advantage of other people to obtain whatever he wanted, but without even using his wits or making any effort as he had the uncanny ability to be instantly liked thanks to his "sweet personality". Even after being warned by Wimpy, Popeye and friends could not help falling under Meldew's spell, though the latter became a more benign figure as he settled into the regular cast. Physically, Meldew is very different from his rotund cousin, being slim and small and always wearing concealing clothes such as a coat, sunglasses and a hat.
