She soon hears a loud noise and runs to see the big mess her children have made in the kitchen. After they run off, Olive notices a crack is forming on the second floor; it is the boys that are cracking nuts open with the aid of a wall bed.

   , which empowers all four, allowing them to fly like jet planes and strafe their mom. They then break the spanking broom and begin to throw Olive back and forth around the house. She wakes up as an elegantly-dressed Popeye comes for his bride. However, Olive angrily refuses, saying she will not marry him under any circumstance. Popeye sings a variation of his theme song about the mystery of women.
