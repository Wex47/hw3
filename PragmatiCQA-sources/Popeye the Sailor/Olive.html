Later sources, mostly in the cartoon series, say that Swee'Pea is Olive Oyl's cousin or nephew that she has to take care of from time to time. Because of the episodic nature of the shorts, Olive's character was severely limited to only serving as a damsel-in-distress who was often kidnapped by Bluto and saved by Popeye. However some shorts did show her as being as much of a scrapper as in

Olive's design was changed quite a bit, now being given more hair, smaller feet, wider eyes and a more feminine face, likely as to try making her a more attractive prize for suitors to fight over.

  <p key="fe629871-da54-4703-9116-ea8ccf4f6e0e">
   This re-design also brought in a drastic change in Olive's personality, where she was now always completely helpless, along with being more vain and fickle towards others, especially Popeye, whom, unlike in previous media, she would quickly leave at the drop of hat over petty or questionable reasons, which made the character come off as very superficial, and only a few shorts ever retained any resemblance to how she was.

Like the earlier theatrical cartoon series, it would use many elements that were already well known, mostly the basic storyline of Popeye trying to keep his sweetheart Olive safe from the hands of other male suitors while using spinach to remain fit and healthy. While the show did involve Popeye and Olive's love life, episodes actually focused more on Popeye and his adventures around the world (and beyond) not unlike the Fleischer and comic strip incarnation.

   Olive is always depicted as a tall, skinny and lanky young woman with a stick-like figure and oversized feet. She has short black hair which she always keeps tied in a bun and wears a pair of large brown boots and a long black dress with a red top that goes past her knees. Her unique frame gives her a number of odd features, with her lanky body being so flexible that it almost seems as though she is made of rubber, with her limbs often twisting or stretching beyond the norm to the point where she might even seem boneless. Despite her odd physique, she is seen as something of a beauty by several male suitors, and her exact charm seems to be that she is very "unique" in her prettiness compared to other women, as explained in the 1960s cartoon episode "Insultin The Sultan".

   A visually different Olive began appearing in later Famous Studios releases. Meant to be more appealing to the eyes of the public, this Olive is noticeably changed, having bigger, more expressive eyes and a modern hairstyle. At the same time, she would demonstrate more empowerment, as she would often put up more of a fight towards her abductor(s) (but with little success) or other female characters trying to woo Popeye. This incarnation, however, is found by some to be more unlikeable due to her vain and fickle tendencies.

   A common criticism refers to how Olive Oyl was employed in the animated adaptations of the original comics (mostly in the Famous Studios era), which made her the center of a love triangle that included Popeye and Bluto. Thus, the finesse and complexity of

   was almost always superseded by simplistic conflict between two rivals for her favor. Because of this, some critics have taken issue with her appearance, regarding her as too ugly, old-looking or plain for such a role as an object of desire, ignoring the fact that she was chiefly meant to be a humorous character by her creator. However, while
   dismiss her as a proper love interest,
   such as author

Despite this, she is a very assertive (sometimes violent) and fickle woman and is not one to hide her true feelings, showing no restraint when she is angered and may even sock some hussies and bozos in the eye if need be. Despite her assertive attitude and confidence, she is still a bit cowardly most of the time, not surprising considering the number of unlucky and dangerous situations she finds herself in regularly, and even more so when having to deal with some of Popeye's dangerous foes, such as Bluto the Terrible, Pirates, Ghosts, Martians or even the dreaded

   . As helpless as she might seem towards more fearsome foes, she is still a tomboyish scrapper who will not back down against ordinary opponents (whether they be armed or unarmed) and will do her best to help others, and when even those who've come to her rescue are incapacitated, she will do whatever it takes to free herself and fight, even willing to sock the likes of the Sea Hag for Popeye's sake when she knows that his chivalrous nature will not allow him to hurt women (no matter how homely and witch-like they are). Olive is also an avid gun enthusiast who was often shown in several strips polishing and admiring her collection, and would only use them against crooks and other armed ruffians who threatened her or others in her day-to-day life, but most of the time she would rather use her mighty feet or quick fists to do pummel others.

   Olive cares deeply about Popeye, and despite their rough start, she eventually grew to love him dearly. However, at times she can be quite bossy and possessive, always wanting to make Popeye do what she wants, but the quick witted sailor usually manages to find a way to avoid his lover's wrath. Despite these difference, the two really do love each other and both are willing to fight for each other if need be, as both get easily jealous and will often fight any potential rivals that threaten to separate them, and Olive will go all out against any rival like the scrapper she is. In fact, Olive's violent tendencies towards rival women once even made her literally go mad with rage. In the Famous Studios cartoons, Olive was portrayed as more of a sassy, vain, shallow and completely helpless woman, with her zany attitude, silly personality and her wacky side. Olive has her romantic feelings for Popeye usually being less faithful and she would often be wooed by the likes of Bluto only for Popeye to win her back in the end, or for both Popeye and Bluto to give up on her.

   , however Olive chose the young Ham Gravy to be her suitor. Regardless, the lowdown Wormwood was determined to win Miss Oyl's hand and often concocted many devious schemes to win her heart, but all ended in failure either in part due to his own shortcomings or the efforts of Ham Gravy. Eventually, Wormwood would finally leave Olive be, allowing her to try and move forward in her relationship with Ham Gravy who would become her more-or-less fiancée. Their relationship however would be a very difficult one as Ham Gravy was a slacker type who did as little work as possible and was always borrowing money when not being enamored by other women. His attraction to other women—particularly if they were rich—naturally incensed Olive, and she once succumbed to a fit of "lunaphobia" (a kind of angry madness) over one of his amours. When she recovered, she continued to pretend to have the disorder to win him back. She was not immune to flattery from other men, but remained committed to Ham throughout the length of their rocky relationship.
