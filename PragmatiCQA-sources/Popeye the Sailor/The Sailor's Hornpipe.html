   The usual tune for this dance was first printed as "The College Hornpipe" in 1797 or 1798 by J. Dale of London, although it was found in manuscript collections before then. The dance evokes the life of a

   . Sailors from the Royal Navy are believed to have invented the solo dance as an exercise. Due to the small space that the dance required, and no need for a partner, it was a popular on-board activity.

   It is likely that "The Sailor's Hornpipe" was originally performed on the wet deck of a ship, in bare feet. Accompaniment may have been the music of a tin whistle or, from the 19th century, a squeezebox. Samuel Pepys referred to it in his diary as "The Jig of the Ship", and Captain Cook, who took a piper on at least one voyage, is noted to have ordered his men to dance the "Hornpipe" in order to keep them in good health. The dance on-ship became less common when fiddlers ceased to be included in ship crews.
