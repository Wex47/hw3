   #421 (February 1973), Captain Strong was created by writer Cary Bates, who had wanted to see what would happen if
   Superman
   and Popeye (or a reasonable proxy of him) were to meet. In the first story, Bates presented a darker side of the famous

   The character was designed to be more realistic-looking than Popeye, but still similar to him in appearance and speech. Other characters who appeared in his stories included Carnox (the DC Comics version of

   , is naturally stronger that most men, but one day he discovered a strange seaweed he called "sauncha," the consumption of which made him superhumanly strong. At first he used his newfound power to do good for others, but the sauncha (which turned out to be of extraterrestrial origin) had unexpected side-effects; it acted like a drug, making its user dangerously irrational and causing severe withdrawal pains. After being stopped by Superman and taken to a hospital, Strong swore off ever using sauncha again, saying that he would only rely on normal vegetables to keep up his strength. Strong became a friend of both Clark Kent and Superman (never realizing they were the same man, of course).

  <p key="fafdc13d-8484-48c8-8974-caa242d6fd32">
   In the rebooted Post-Crisis continuity, Horatio was changed to be a drug-addict who was addicted to a type of alien seaweed called "Speed Weed", both a pun on the DC writer and producer
   Speed Weed
   , and a parody of Popeye's spinach. Like the sailor's vegetable of choice, Speed Weed seemed to increase Strong's strength, but, unlike spinach, it turned him violent and misanthropic, often getting in fights and wishing to avoid the company of everyone, even his wife. When Harley Quinn helped him overcome his addiction, his true personality, that of a kind, good-natured soul shined through once more as he became an ally of Quinn.
