   ", this is simply due to the word "Kong" taken as synonymous to "ape". In fact, game designer Shigeru Miyamoto has admitted that his original idea was to create a Popeye video game.

   boasts four different screens, each making up a stage, that comprise the game's setting of a building under construction. In three of the four screens, the player has to guide the hero character as he makes his way towards the top platform where his beloved is held captive, by running, jumping and climbing ladders. He can however obtain an item (a hammer) that briefly allows him to wreak destruction upon the obstacles that that the enemy sends his way. The remaining screen requires the hero to retrieve the various bolts that support the platform his foe is standing on, causing him to fall and the lady's rescue to be complete. After that, a second "level" begins where the game starts again with increased difficulty, the cycle repeating endlessly.
