    hamburger sandwich
   </b>
   is a popular dish believed to have been invented in the United States owing to influence from the cuisine of Hamburg, Germany. It usually consists of a patty of ground meat such as beef placed between the halves of a bread roll, although "hamburger" may refer also to the patty on its own. A hamburger sandwich can be served with tomato, lettuce, onions, condiments and other ingredients sandwiched along with the meat.

   . While his preference for hamburgers is well noted, this may stem from their convenience and availability, for Wimpy is not one to shy away from any type of meal that could feed his considerable girth, as long as it can be obtained for free. In comics and cartoons revolving around Wimpy, hamburgers are typically central to the plot. Sometimes, this sees him get entangled in situations involving
