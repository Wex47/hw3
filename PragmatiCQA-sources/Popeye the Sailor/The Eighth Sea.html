   The ship reaches the Land of Dooma, "a city of gold in an unknown sea", and the first person they encounter there is John Smith, a college professor/adventure book author who has been stranded in this place due to losing a pencil. He tells Popeye and friends that the natives use gold as building materials, thus, if they ignore how gold is valued in Popeye's world, the visitors could take as much as they wanted. Smith helps Popeye contact King Yoko, ruler of this land, and the visitors learn that his once-powerful kingdom is slowly sinking into the ocean, so the residents have mostly moved away.

   After Popeye secures the huge stash of gold and they leave Dooma behind, the land finally crumbles into the ocean. John Smith intends to end his life immediately, but is saved by Popeye and brought onto the ship. The floor of the ocean starts to cave in, which causes giant waves to rise, putting everyone in danger. A series of disasters follow suit, and the ship is completely wrecked.

   Despite the difficulties, Popeye and his friends, as well as John Smith, manage to safely reach dry land - Blozo's nation, specifically - without losing their $50 billion worth of gold. King Blozo has eliminated his "worries", leading to the next storyline, "Long Live the King".
