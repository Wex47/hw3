    Barney Google and Snuffy Smith
   </b>
   are the titular protagonists from an American comic strip created in 1919 by cartoonist Billy DeBeck. Barney is a sophisticated type, a sports and gambling enthusiast and owner of the feeble racehorse Spark Plug. Snuffy Smith appeared later, whom Barney met and became close friends with, then eventually came to dominate the series. Snuffy is a diminutive, rough hillbilly type who lives in the remote community of Hootin' Holler with his rotund wife Loweezy, his young nephew Jughaid and his infant son Tater.
