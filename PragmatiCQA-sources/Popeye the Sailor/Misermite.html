   Misermites are a short race of men resembling dwarfs who all look exactly alike, having large noses, short and messy black hair, and small beady eyes. They even wear the same attire, consisting of a black coat with two or three buttons and a collar, and pants that may either be blue or striped.

   The Misermites are a long-feared island race of dwarf-like men who sail the seas stealing from any island or port they come across and revisiting their targets every six months, creating a never ending cycle of theft and destruction.

   , they were shocked to wake up in the middle of the night to find that the town had been invaded by a tiny race of men who were none other than the Misermites. After receiving a brief explanation of their history from the local inn manager, Popeye hoped to have a chance at wiping the floor with the half-pint hoodlums, but before he got the chance they all quickly vanished, having run off back to their

   with utmost swiftness after successfully plundering everything in town in an instant, Swee'Pea included. Popeye then enquired the inn manager as to where the Misermites had gone with his adopted boy-kid, and with the location of Misermite Island now known, Popeye and Wimpy quickly set sail to rescue Swee'Pea from the wicked imps.

   As Popeye and Wimpy arrive on Misermite Island, they quickly fall into the King's trap and find themselves imprisoned, where they are forced to sign a sinister contract by the Misermites in exchange for their freedom, with the contract stating that if Popeye were to lose, he may never return to Misermite Island should he survive the battle, and Swee'Pea would remain the King Miser's slave forever. Popeye is forced to comply and is then taken to Zoog himself, who is revealed to be a giant Misermite, easily the size of a large barn. The giant lummox proves to be a formidable powerhouse capable of easily crushing Popeye and sending him flying, but, as the beatings continue, Popeye's rage reaches its peak and he finally lands a blow on the giant. However, Zoog begins to literally fall to pieces as he is revealed to be a giant robot controlled by several Misermites. With the Misermites and their King shamefully defeated, Popeye returns home with Swee'Pea while forcing the Misermite Kingdom to return everything they had stolen.
