   being an action man and a strength-based character, his cartoons have oftentimes been observed to be "all about the muscles." Popeye's victories are frequently presaged by him doing a muscle pose, sometimes with a depiction of some element of great potency (a volcano, a stick of dynamite, a nuclear warhead) appearing on his bicep. This powerful symbol of his strength mostly occurs as indicative of his ingestion of

   who never backs down from a fight. He possesses enormous forearms like a stevedore's, made all the more prominent by his very thin upper arms and other body parts. This device serves to underline his deceptively strong nature as well as (most notably in the animated cartoons) to emphasize the transformation wrought by the spinach, in which his upper arms gain oversized muscles, accompanied on occasion by an enlargement of his chest - which has been known to even grow chest hair. The muscle growth is a momentary phenomenon, however; the resultant power surge remains in force until his enemies have been thoroughly beaten.
