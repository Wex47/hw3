   As the episode begins, Popeye and Bluto arrive at Olive's residence simultaneously looking for a date, and the usual altercation ensues.  Olive separates the combatants and proposes that they all "spend a nice, quiet evening at home."  Seated in between her bored-looking suitors, she pulls out a volume marked "Family Album," and giggles.  "Here's one of Popeye's baby pictures, taken with his Pappy," she observes.  Bluto stirs to life and admits responsibility for inflicting Popeye's "first shiner" that is plainly in evidence in the photograph.  "Oh yeah?  Well, let me tells ya what REALLY happinged that day," retorts Popeye.

   A flashback scene commences with an infant Popeye in a carriage pushed by a young-ish Poopdeck Pappy (he is dressed in a conservative tweed business suit and is bereft of the beard and salty accent known from various other cartoons).  They are confronted by what is clearly Pappy's enemy, "that big bully and his little bruiser, Bluto."  We see a man of intimidating size with a thick handlebar moustache clad in a ruffian's tee shirt and bowler hat.  His infant son is practicing

   We witness a series of  mean-spirited assaults on little Popeye by the aggressive baby Bluto (his father laughs with approval) as Poopdeck's sense of alarm escalates.  Finally, even as Popeye's carriage is sent careening down a hill and into traffic, Bluto Senior mounts Poopdeck Pappy on a lamppost and instigates a beating (as Bluto would do to Popeye in

Bluto flies out the window and rockets past Olive's clothesline, where he somehow becomes entangled in some feminine lingerie that gives him the appearance of a bearded baby in a bonnet.  He comes to rest in a conveniently-placed baby carriage, bawling uncontrollably (as in
