   The cartoon opens with a view of 'Ye Village Smithy', and, as if to underscore the connection with the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem, the arboreal specimen adjoining it is prominently labelled 'Chestnut Tree'. Olive Oyl, here drawn in the style of her original comics incarnation - with a very thin body and huge high-button shoes - has apparently entered this physically demanding field of employment due to the manpower shortages engendered by

   . A series of vignettes establishes her lack of ability at this line of work. At last, cooling her burned bottom in a vat of water, she muses, 'Oh, I've reached the bottom... What I need is a good, strong man around here!'

   Happening by, Popeye and Bluto, already drooling at the sight of her exposed legs as she bends over, are quick to respond. "I heard your S.O.S for a strong man,' Bluto states, bumping an eager Popeye away with his buttocks. 'There y'are, muscles like i-ron!" Bluto does a bicep pose; tapping on it, Olive elicits a metallic thud and appreciates its implication of great might. There follows a series of tests of physical prowess between Bluto and Popeye, several of which (Popeye utilizing his jaw to mold molten metal into horseshoes; Bluto bending a steel bar and laboriously lifting a massive weight; Bluto tossing an anvil and sending both it and Popeye crashing through the floor) were reused with only slight modifications in the 1950 cartoon

   Finally, after a brief exchange of blows, Bluto's superior size wins the confrontation and Popeye is waylaid right through the blacksmith forge, smashing it to pieces. The apparent victor announces to Olive, 'Okay, beautiful, I'm all yours!' and lets loose with a crazed wolf howl. The alarmed Olive rejects him, causing the big man, true to form, to physically restrain and then abduct her. Meanwhile, the seemingly defeated Popeye has found his way to his

   In a plot twist, Olive approaches the beaten Bluto and, in a suggestive tone of voice, purrs, 'I do hope you're not hurt, 'cause I want you to stay here and be mama's little helper!' Bluto quickly returns to his senses and is overjoyed that he has been chosen over Popeye. But his jubilation turns to outrage when he sees Olive drive off in a carriage with Popeye, proffering a final dig of 'Toodaloo, strong man!' as she leaves Bluto to work at the shop. As the cartoon ends, we see that Bluto has placed his head on an anvil and is smacking himself over and over with a pair of sledgehammers.
