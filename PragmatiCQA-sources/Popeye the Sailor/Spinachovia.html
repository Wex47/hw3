   Spinachovia is mainly home to a reasonably large number of people of presumably European descent. However, the current Spinachovian inhabitants were not the first men to dwell on the island. Before they first arrived, the place was home to the
   Big-Eared Pygmies
   , warring large-lobed dwarfs who lived in secrecy in the highest mountains of the island, not letting the settlers even know of their existence, something the pygmies used to their advantage as they enjoyed stealing from the farms of the Spinachovian settlers, that remained completely unaware of their presence. At least, until the pygmies became sick of the spinach crops, which was all the colonists ever bothered to farm. The island also receives many strange visitors and dangerous invaders from other islands, such as warring clans and giants.

   Tonsylania
   , which led Nazilias's king Blozo to hire Popeye's services in hopes of ending the war. Originally, Tonsylania and Nazilia formed the fictional Addynoid Islands. Since its first appearance, Segar continued to use the kingdom on occasion. One story introduced the existence of hostile "White Savages" in Northern Nazilia. However, in future appearances, it would be renamed several times.

   Confusingly, Popeye once formed his own nation on  a small island adjacent to Nazilia known as "Spinachova" - which led to a feud between Popeye and King Blozo. Spinachova is presumably not the same as Nazilia/Spinachovia. Nazilia is also said to contain several landmarks, such as an aquatic tree holding a deadly snake.
