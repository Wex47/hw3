   Nevertheless, at the age of 17, Questel won a talent contest held at the RKO Fordham Theatre in the Bronx, by imitating Helen Kane. She was signed by an agent and began performing in vaudeville as an impressionist. Billed as "Mae Questel - Personality Singer of Personality Songs," she did Marlene Dietrich, Eddie Cantor, Mae West and others, as well as animal imitations. She was seen by animator

   , who was looking for an actress to provide the voice for his Betty Boop character. Questel's "Boop-oop-a-doop" routine, done in a style similar to that of the song's originator, Helen Kane, while at the same time evoking something of the naughty allure of film star Clara Bow, was exactly what Fleischer wanted, and he hired Questel in 1931. She began as one of a number of actresses providing the character's voice, but soon took over the role exclusively, essaying it in more than 150 animated shorts. Along with her voice work and occasional on-camera appearance in Paramount shorts, Questel also attended Columbia University, where she studied drama.
