    Freddy's Dead
   </i>
   , Freddy Krueger was stuck in Hell, unable to return to the dreams of Springwood's children. By keeping the children in the town in the dark as to his existence, Freddy lost his power to invade their dreams, effectively ending his reign of terror.

   Freddy's hope is that the people of Springwood will assume that he is responsible for Jason's carnage, thereby giving him an opening to reenter their dreams.

   While Blake is away getting some beer, Jason enters the house and kills Trey by stabbing him and bending the bed in two, breaking Trey's back. The remaining teenagers run outdoors and find a police officer.

  <p key="9e72a74f-8fc4-400d-9553-0c52b1d6e53b">
   Because Lori lives in the same house that Nancy did, one police officer assumes the killer was Freddy and says his name before being silenced by the chief. The chief maintains they must keep Freddy "contained."

  <p key="0f7cf238-7965-4673-b5c9-daeb852c556d">
   At the police station, Lori is confused at the interrogation. Deputy Stubbs, the police officer who was first on the scene, tells Lori that he has only been in town for a month, indicating that he does not know about the Freddy history. Instead, he assumes that it’s a copycat of Jason Vorhees. While waiting for her dad, Lori remembers Freddy's name and falls asleep.

   After wandering around, she finds an obviously not teenage girl who has her eyes cut out. She tells Lori about Freddy and that everyone should know about him and they should all be afraid. This is obviously strongly implying that the girl is actually Freddy in one of his alternate forms.

   Blake's father yells at Blake for being over at Lori's, but Blake angrily asks for some privacy. After promising to avenge Trey, Blake falls asleep and dreams of Freddy. Fortunately, Freddy is not strong enough to kill Blake yet. In order to instill more fear, Freddy allows Jason to continue killing. When Blake wakes up, he and his father are murdered by Jason.

   Will then sees the murder report on TV and resolves to escape to see if Lori's all right. Will insists that he saw Lori's dad kill her mom and he has to get out to protect her from her father. Will and Mark manage to break out.

   The following day, Lori's father tries to keep her from going to school. He also tries to give her orange juice with Hypnocil in it, but Lori refuses it. Upon arriving at school, Kia tells Lori that the police blame everything on Blake, saying he committed suicide after murdering Trey. They don't want to give the town any reason to remember Freddy, so they cover up any traces of his rampage.

   Because of the murders, the student body decides to hold a rave in a corn field and all of the girls decide to go. While describing Freddy to Gibb and Kia, Mark and Will approach Lori, who passes out. When the police show up, Mark and Will run away to keep from being seen.

   Will and Mark research what is going on and find out that the town has been trying to quarantine Freddy like he was a disease. Once they discover its the fear of Freddy that gives him his power, Mark realizes he screwed up the town's plan. He allows Will to take his van and go find Lori.

   At the rave, Gibb gets angry at Bill Freeburg for being insensitive about Trey. She gets incredibly drunk and wanders off. Seeing a broken up Trey, she follows him into an old farm building. Inside, Freddy tries to kill her.

   Outside of the dream, a raver tries to rape Gibb, Before Freddy can kill her, Jason stabs her with a spear in the real world, killing both Gibb and the raver.

   When they get to Lori's home, Will tells Lori the truth about her father killing her mother, which is why he was placed in Westin Hills. Lori didn't know what to believe until she got into an arguement with her father. Lori storms into the house and wanted to know the truth about her mother's death.
  </p>
  <p key="ecda3287-a127-491c-a5fe-f81ce8e27093">
   She finds out that her dad works at Westin Hills and therefore knew where Will was all of this time. Her father tells her not to worry and pushes for her to take some pills to help her sleep. Lori sneaks out the house and finds Will.

   Meanwhile, Mark falls asleep and has an encounter with Freddy. Freddy is willing to let Mark live, but only if Mark passes along a message. Mark refuses so Freddy kills him by setting him on fire. When Will and Lori arrive, they find Mark burning and the message "Freddy's Back" burned on his back.

   comes in and tells him the story of Jason and believes that a copycat may be commiting the murders but the sheriff already knows Freddy is behind the murders. Deputy Stubbs wants to know why they wouldn't tell him about Freddy, but he dismisses him and says they don't say HIS name out loud. Stubbs leaves frustrated.
  </p>
  <p key="8854a121-d616-4593-ab42-691c76c8c4fe">
   At Mark's house, Lori and the others try to form a plan when Stubbs comes in and tells them about Jason's life. Lori falls asleep and meets Freddy in her dream. She manages to grab a piece of Freddy before waking up and realizes she can pull him into the physical world.
  </p>
  <p key="fdce6ee0-42c7-446d-9911-fbff759324cf">
   By piecing the clues together, they find out the truth: there are two killers. Although Stubbs believes that Jason is just a copycat and not the real Jason, the teenagers agree that there are enough weird things going on that it has to be the real Jason. They realize they have to get Freddy out from the dream world and into the physical world, in order to do so they plan to sneak into Westin Hills to get Hypnocil.
  </p>
  <p key="49230866-1b60-4fc4-8241-0c080db95097">
   At Westin Hills, they split up as the guard is killed by Jason, who followed them. Meanwhile, Freeburg is smoking pot and begins to see Freddy, who turned into a caterpillar. Freddy, in Freedburg's body, pours Hypnocil down the sink. Linderman and Stubbs find him, but Jason arrives and electrocutes Stubbs.
  </p>
  <p key="808493e1-a958-4927-b996-35fa32988ec7">
   Linderman then goes to find the rest of the group. The others find the empty bottles of Hypnocil and continue searching until Jason sees them and throws the dead Stubbs through the door. A Freddy-possessed Freedburg is able to tranqualize Jason at the cost of his own life.
  </p>
  <p key="5a89b612-dbb2-4f79-9b08-aead70485413">
   In the dream, Freddy unsuccessfully tries to kill Jason. Finally, he finds that Jason fears water and he uses this information to torment Jason.

   Lori, Will, Kia, and Linderman take the sleeping Jason to Camp Crystal Lake so he can fight Freddy, they figure he will have "home-field" advantage. They figure if Jason wins, he would have no reason to go back to Elm Street and they will all be safe. Lori is injected with a tranquilizer so she can pull Freddy out of the dream world. Freddy nearly drowns Jason, and as Kia is about to give him mouth-to-mouth he suddenly wakes up.
  </p>
  <p key="8f1476fc-e123-40f8-8d41-50a3b16b965d">
   In a cabin at Camp Crystal Lake, Jason attacks Will, Kia, and Linderman, knocking Linderman onto the sharp edge of a shelf, mortally wounding him. After learning that it was Freddy who killed her mother, Lori eventually able to pull Freddy out of the dream world. Freddy and Jason engaged in an epic, bloody battle. In the middle of the fight, Kia distracts Freddy so Lori and Will could escape, but is killed by Jason.
  </p>
  <p key="55f1eebb-7988-4d45-bcdb-5f370f3560aa">
   Freddy and Jason's battle continues with Jason suffering many injuries at the hands of Freddy, they are knocked over to the docks of Crystal Lake. Jason slashes Freddy several times before Freddy cuts off his fingers and takes his machete, and inflictes several more injuries on him.
  </p>
  <p key="b2f9d6d9-bb40-4169-8bcb-f81a11925326">
   Lori, meanwhile, sprayed the docks with gasoline from nearby tanks, takes a torch from the burning cabin and sets them on fire. Jason takes advantage of a distracted Freddy and impales him with his hand, and pulls his right arm off. Freddy was able to stab Jason with his own machete before the tanks exploded, setting both villains on fire and sending them flying into Crystal Lake.
  </p>
  <p key="88f051a8-2499-496f-b27d-3db39d9ede60">
   Freddy survives the explosion and moves in to kill Lori and Will, when suddenly Jason stabs him from behind with his arm (that has the clawed glove). Lori pickes up Jason's machete and decapitates Freddy with it. His head and body fall into the water as Jason sinks below the surface. Lori throws the machete in the water and walks away with Will.
  </p>
  <p key="267aa2ce-b822-461b-90fc-26f7c0a1725c">
   Afterwards, during daytime, Jason walks out of Crystal Lake, carrying Freddy's severed head, which winks to the audience, leaving the ending to be ambiguous.
