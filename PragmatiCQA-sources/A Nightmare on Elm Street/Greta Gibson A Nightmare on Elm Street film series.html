She is the most humorous and outgoing one between her, Alice and Yvonne. Greta is deeply annoyed by her mother's control and desires more freedom, and often complains about this to her friends.

   Greta is friends with Alice Johnson and an aspiring model. Her mother, Racine, is overbearing and has almost complete control on Greta's lifestyle and eating habits, intending to make Greta a star model while telling people that "they are always being mistaken for sisters." Greta and her mother are often at blows because of Greta's lack of freedom from her controlling mother.

   That night, she joins a graduation pool party with Dan and Mark. They are joined by Yvonne who has just finished a dive into the pool. When Yvonne asks her why she doesn't go swimming, Greta responds that she will be attending a fashion photo shoot later on, arranged by her mother.  When talking about how she dislikes how her mother controls her life, Mark compares her story with his comic character.  Greta teases him, saying he's really weird. When Dan gets called off for a phone call, he tells everyone not to touch his Champagne, but Mark then touches it anyway, causing her to laugh. After Dan comes back from the call, he takes his outfit and prepares to leave to which Mark then describes Dan as 'faster thing on three legs', causing Greta to laugh again.

   A few hours later, after Dan Jordan was brutally murdered by Freddy Krueger, one scene shows Greta looking at Dan's picture, mourning over the death of her friend. Her mother then tells her to go to bed. As she leaves, she brings down a doll on her drawer, causing it to smash to the ground. The second day, Alice tries to warn Greta and her two other friends, Mark Gray and Yvonne, about Freddy, but the three don't take her seriously, in words of comfort Greta does tell Alice that even if someone was after her, they would have to go through them first.

   That same night at a dinner party Racine is holding to promote Greta's future modeling career, Greta falls asleep at the table. The dream starts out with Greta arguing with Racine about her eating habits when Freddy comes in and locks Greta inside a modified high-chair. He serves up a plate containing a self-image replica doll of herself, which he then cuts open and begins to force-feed its organs to Greta while the dream versions of the party-goers, and Racine, all laugh at her. Greta's cheeks swell up in size from the organs that Freddy is shoving into her mouth. Freddy begins to mock her and tells her "you are what you eat!" revealing that he has been feeding Greta her own organs all along. Greta starts crying in frustration and pain as Freddy mockingly holds her in his arms, before beginning to violently shake her. From the perception of the dinner guests in the real world, she stands up and starts

At Alice's home, Greta's dream-self appears to her through her refrigerator door, crying for help. Alice tries to pull her out, only to have Freddy snatch her back into the refrigerator. In the real world, Greta continues to choke and shake, but dies moments later.

   Out of all of them, Mark takes her death the hardest, since he could not tell her that he loved her. Greta appears three times in the movie after that. The first as her soul (along with Dan's), is being fed to Alice's unborn son Jacob so Freddy can absorb it. The second time is in Mark's dream, in a comic book and a hallucination of Greta, being used by Freddy to mock him. And the third is when the soul of herself, Dan, and Mark escape from Freddy after Jacob uses his power on Freddy reverting him to an infant.
