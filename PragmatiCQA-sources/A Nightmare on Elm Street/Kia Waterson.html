   The following day at school, Kia informed Lori that Blake was dead. She said that the police blamed Blake for Trey's murder and that Blake then murdered his dad and committed suicide, comparing it to the Columbine massacre. Kia got angry, knowing that the police were lying to cover up the real crime.

   showed up at the school. While Lori was recovering in a nurse's office, Kia and Gibb sat out in the waiting room. Kia asked the nurse about anesthesia for a nose job. She then unknowingly fell asleep while reading a magazine. While flipping through the magazine, she came upon a picture of Freddy Krueger who reached out and grabbed her nose with his glove. Freddy ripped her nose off, causing Kia to wake up. Upon awakening, she threw the magazine across the floor.

   Later that night, a rave was held in a cornfield. Kia attended with Lori and Gibb. Kia walked up on on Lori while Linderman was offering to get her a drink. She then proceeded to call Linderman a bed wetter because he was covered in beer, which had happened when the bully

   forced him to drink it. Linderman then finally stood up to Kia, which seemed to impress her. Later in the night when Will showed up to talk to Lori, Kia insisted that Linderman dance with her. When Jason attacked the rave, Kia fled with Will and Lori, stopping only briefly when she noticed Gibb was killed.

   At Westin Hills, Freddy possessed Freeburg and injected Jason with tranquilizer. Putting Jason in Mark's van, the group kept him tranquilized as they took Jason to Crystal Lake. They planned on pulling Freddy out of the

   so that Jason could battle him in real life. While Lori was in the Dream World, Freddy tried drowning Jason. Kia was then pressured by Will and Linderman to give Jason mouth to mouth. Before she could, however, Jason awoke. His sudden waking up startled Will, who crashed the van, sending Jason flying out into the forest.

   Kia helped Linderman out of the building and laid him up against a tree. Linderman insisted he would be fine and told Kia to go get help. Initially reluctant, Kia told Linderman she would be back and she ran off to get help.

   Later in the night, Freddy was about to kill Lori when he was challenged by Kia. Temporarily losing interest in Lori, Freddy approached Kia. Kia began to make jokes about Freddy and how he wasn't scary. At first, Freddy seemed annoyed but suddenly he looked amused. He motioned for Kia to look behind her. With a look of fear in her eyes, Kia turned around to see Jason standing behind her. He hit her hard with his machete, knocking her up hard against a tree killing her.
