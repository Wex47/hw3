   </a>
   or her relationship with Freddy before he became a killer.
  </p>
  <p key="d458c231-dd8e-4af2-b6df-ef4b47dd0df5">
   It was assumed that Loretta was in high school when she first met the would-be-killer Freddy, who was a high school dropout and worked as a janitor.
  </p>
  <p key="4376d8d2-3165-4df0-867c-e40fa5daf0c2">
   Loretta, unlike the rest of the town, apparently saw something good in Freddy, which made her fall in love with him and it got Freddy to love her back.
  </p>
  <p key="5245678b-3b8f-41a2-a96e-fb227888f54b">
   It appeared back then that Freddy was trying so hard to be normal for Loretta and their child,
   Katherine
   . But Freddy couldn't stop his murderous nature forever, as he soon had a "special room" made.
  </p>
  <p key="b242794d-feab-4cb8-a2b3-023130014efe">
   Loretta did appear to love her husband and adore her child. After she discovered a room in the basement full of bladed gloves, other weapons, and a scrapbook of newspaper articles about children murdered in the area, Loretta came to the conclusion that Freddy, her darling husband, was the "Springwood Slasher", a sadistic murderer who abducted and killed children in the area, and used one of the bladed gloves that she found in the basement.
  </p>
  <p key="04075aa3-d3da-4a87-92fb-564c01ed5d01">
   Even after Loretta promised that she wouldn't tell about his murders, Freddy strangled her to death anyway, and did not realize that his 6-year-old daughter, Katherine, was watching.
  </p>
  <p key="2b1312c7-76be-4ba7-9a35-3914e2b8575b">
   It's really unknown if Freddy did truly love Loretta, but whatever love that he had, it quickly left him when he killed her.
  </p>
  <p key="d9f6b03b-dbc1-4646-947c-615c9a83bda9">
   Later, after Loretta's death, Freddy was caught and Katherine was adopted and moved away from Springwood, and had her name changed to Maggie Burroughs.
  </p>
  <p key="0b116728-5499-4fcc-a10d-a233af3472f2">
   Her mother's death, as well as the deaths of the teens, drove Maggie to defeat her father.
