   Kris awoke to hear her dog
   Rufus
   barking and went outside to get him to be quiet. When she found Rufus, she discovered that Rufus is dead with claw marks on him. Freddy made his appearance as Kris ran towards her house. When she entered, she discovered that she was in a preschool and she is shortly greeted by a younger version of herself. As they went down the hall, Kris heard Freddy's voice and saw him in a classroom. Freddy turned towards her and tells Kris "Ready or not, here I come".

   Kris "awoke" and tried to wake up Jesse to no avail. Kris went into her bathroom to wash up then returned to her bedroom, thinking that her nightmare is over. As soon as she laid down in bed, Freddy appeared and attacked her. Kris screamed, which woke Jesse who watched in horror as Kris was thrown around her room. Jesse tried to get her to wake her up. Kris' chest was slit and her blood splattered all over Jesse's clothes. She finally fell off the ceiling and died on her bed. Jesse was accused of Kris' murder and was sent to jail where he had a dream in which he found Kris' dead body. Nancy also had a micro-nap in the school hallway, seeing Kris in a body bag. She asked Nancy if she wants to hang out, followed by Freddy's laugh.
