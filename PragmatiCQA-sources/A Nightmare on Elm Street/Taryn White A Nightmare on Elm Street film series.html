   Despite that, Taryn has a more compassionate side towards the others, she is also able to defend herself against harassment of a hospital guard and his seduction of drugs. Taryn shows true courage when Joey is trapped in the dream world, as she is willing to risk her own life to save her friend. She seemed to also care about Kristen, as she laments to Dr. Gordon what happened to her and is concerned about her being alone in quiet room within arms reach of Freddy. When she gets separated from the others, her first concern is to find Kristen the second she hears her voice. However Freddy intercepts and kills her before she can find Kristen.

   Little is known about Taryn's early life, although her parents along with other parents, killed Freddy. So because of that, she is born as an Elm Street child, and prior to her admission to Westin Hills, she had been addicted to drugs. However, she chose to be admitted to avoid juvenile hall and vowed to give them up and was clean during Nancy's visits to the hospital. However, Taryn did still keep her smoking habit.

   Freddy first attacks Phillip by using his veins and controlling him like a marionette puppet, making him sleepwalk off of a balcony. Minutes before Joey noticed Phillip by the balcony and alerts everyone, they watch in horror as Phillip dies. The day after, many people considered it a sleepwalking accident. Later Nancy Thompson, who vanquished Freddy six years ago and Dr. Neil Gordon work together as their psychiatrists and recognizes everyone's identifications of Freddy.

   Shortly afterwards Freddy kills Jennifer by smashing her head through a television screen.

From there she can hear Kristen calling for Nancy, and as she follows the voice, she ends up in a dead-end part of the alley where she possibly used to do drugs.

   With the help and guidance of Nancy Thompson, Taryn discovered her very own unique dream power that made her "beautiful and bad." When she utilized her dream power, Taryn's appearance changes significantly to a punk biker. She wears lipstick and eye makeup, black leather biker's clothes with spikes, fingerless gloves and most notably, her long hair is done up in a mohawk. She also wields two switchblades, which she is able to fight with expertly. When Freddy absorbs her soul after killing her, he gets her dream power.

   In this form, Taryn was shown to be quite a capable and powerful combatant, able to stand up and hold her own against Freddy for a short time before he defeated her. She even managed to wound him, a feat in which not many characters were not strong enough to accomplish by themselves.
