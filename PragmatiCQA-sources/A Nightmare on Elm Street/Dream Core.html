   The Dream Core first appeared after Alice entered the Dream World and fought off Freddy, by first impaling him on some spikes. After that, Alice used her Dream Master power to create Dream Manics and controlled them to slash Freddy into several pieces. Eventually, Freddy was seemly defeated. Freddy pulled Alice into his Dream Core and tried to slow her down. In his Dream Core, Freddy tried his best to get Jacob back, and he even tried to change into Jacob's father,
   Dan Jordan
   , to cheat Jacob, but he failed. Freddy then went back into hiding inside Alice as she finally caught up to Jacob.

Jacob shot what appeared to be a tongue beam at Freddy, and the souls of Dan, Greta, and Mark are released, and Freddy was turned back into an infant, as was Jacob. Freddy and Jacob were both absorbed by Amanda
