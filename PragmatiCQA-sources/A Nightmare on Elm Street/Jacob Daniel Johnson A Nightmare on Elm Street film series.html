   Unknown to Alice, it appears that Jacob inherited his mother's gift of pulling others into dreams. Mainly his, since Dr. Moore later on told Alice that babies could dream as they develop. Freddy manipulated the baby into helping him and was unwittingly used so Freddy could kill many people, including his own father Dan Jordan. Jacob would meet Alice, unknowingly, in her dreams and tried to befriend the boy.

As Yvonne was looking for Amanda's body, Alice and Jacob spent their time in the dreamworld running from Freddy. Freddy even attempted to use Dan's form to get Jacob to come to him. But Alice, seeing through this got Jacob to run away from him instead.

   However, Freddy caught up with them and tried to seize Alice within himself. Alice then succeeded in pulling Freddy's soul away from her body with her Dream Master power, but because of the strong pain, she loses her strength to fight back. Fortunately, seeing Freddy for what he was, Jacob tricked him into letting Alice go. Amanda, now freed by Yvonne, gave Jacob advice to use the power Freddy gave him, against him. Jacob turned on Freddy and was able to release the souls of Alice's friends and his father; reducing Freddy to a helpless infant.

   Jacob has an unofficial appearance in novel side stories. It took place a few years after the events of Nightmare 5. Jacob, now grown up, together with his mother Alice have returned to Springwood in order to finish up with her father's belongings after he died (implied to be by Freddy). Alice is uneasy about returning, but eventually reunites with Yvonne who is now a Police Officer.
