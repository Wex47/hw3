   Mister Mueller was a man who appeared to be in his early to mid forties and lived in the town of
   <a href="Springwood A Nightmare on Elm Street film series.html" key="d66a0c24-8e8d-4356-a366-6a4068105f7a" title="Springwood (A Nightmare on Elm Street film series)">

   , Ohio. He had a teenage son named Blake and a daughter whose name is unknown.
  </p>
  <p key="4976a46e-5b80-4390-91fb-34ee68737470">
   In 2003, Mister Mueller learned about the gruesome murder of Blake's best friend, Trey Cooper, which occurred at 1428 Elm Street. He walked onto the front porch of his home and found Blake sitting on a bench.
  </p>
  <p key="bbe6046b-55fb-49b2-8ebb-bb291f74dcb4">
   He asked him why he was over there anyway as Blake was supposed to be watching after his little sister. He then asked him if he had been drinking.
  </p>
  <p key="ab86cebe-77eb-4dd5-9b72-49b6823f2a4e">
   Clearly distraught, Blake snapped back, telling him that his best friend had just been murdered and he needed him to ease up. Mister Mueller grimaced and told Blake that he needed to watch himself before storming off back into the house.
  </p>
  <p key="4c54d8bd-2ca0-417f-8cf5-28789712e34c">
   Caught up in a drunken stupor, Blake fell asleep on the bench and had a nightmare wherein the demonic dream entity, Freddy Krueger, tried to murder him. When he awakened, he found his father sitting on the bench next to him.
  </p>
  <p key="02277468-8f39-47ef-a4b7-5576b53052c1">
   The man said nothing and Blake quickly learned that his father was dead as the man's head slid off of its neck, having clearly been neatly severed.
  </p>
  <p key="b1f05619-93b7-4f7c-a975-1e8114116b4d">
   Screaming in fright, Blake caught his father's head and turned to find his killer, Jason Voorhees, standing before him. Jason swung his machete down upon them and Blake vainly tried to deflect the attack with his father's head.
