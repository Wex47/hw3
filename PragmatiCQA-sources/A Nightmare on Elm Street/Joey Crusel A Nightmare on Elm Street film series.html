   Freddy first attacks Phillip by using his veins and controlling him like a marionette puppet, making him sleepwalk off of a balcony. Minutes before Joey noticed Phillip by the balcony and alerts everyone and they watch in horror as Phillip dies. The day after, many people considered it a sleepwalking accident. Later Nancy Thompson, who vanquished Freddy six years ago and Dr. Neil Gordon work together as their psychiatrists and recognizes everyone's identifications of Freddy.

   Right after Freddy kills Jennifer by smashing her head through a television screen.

However at the same time, Joey has a dream about a nurse that he thought was attractive and reveals to be Freddy and captures Joey by hanging him over a pit of fire, while in the real world he falls into a coma. Once Kristen and the others find out what just happened, they all gather together in the Dream World to save him while Dr. Neil and Nancy's father dump holy water on Freddy's bones and bury them. On the way, Freddy separates them and kills Taryn, and then kills Will after a short battle.

   While Kincaid and Kristen hold off Freddy, Nancy saves Joey from certain death. Freddy then disappears and takes over his bones and kills Sgt. Thompson and beats up Neil. In the meanwhile the Dream Warriors walk down a hall of mirrors. Freddy appears and pulls Kristen, Nancy and Kincaid in the mirrors. When all hope is lost, Joey stands and uses his dream power to yell extremely loud and destroys all of the mirrors. Joey finally speaks and rejoice over their victory, only for Freddy to disguise himself as Nancy's father and stab her. Freddy locks Joey and Kincaid out of the room, leaving Kristen against Freddy. Nancy attacks Freddy stabs him. Afterwards Freddy is glowing gold because Neil buried the bones. Later Kristen, Kincaid and Joey are mourning over Nancy's grave.
