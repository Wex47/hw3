   It was the year 1999 and Freddy had returned, killing all the children and teenagers of Springwood leaving the adults of the town (with only some retaining their sanity) with mass hysteria. John Doe was found outside Springwood and brought to the shelter in a new town far away from Springwood where Maggie Burroughs and a trio of teens (Tracy, Spencer and Carlos) drove to Springwood to spark John's memory and find some information of the town, the trio were unable to find a way out of the town and decided to rest at 1428 Elm Street eventually Carlos and Spencer were killed and Maggie, Tracy and John were in a hurry to

Freddy killed John consuming his soul and erasing him, Carlos, and Spencer from everyone's memories (except Doc, Maggie, and Tracy and they were not erased from existence), Freddy was now free of the binding that held him to Springwood. Maggie eventually killed Freddy for good citing the famous death quote

   as a means to be remembered. Without the town's fear, he is powerless. Succeeding in returning, Freddy began to kill again in dreams but because Jason was physically seen murdering people, he was the one they feared. Deciding to get rid of Jason in order to keep himself in the spotlight, he battles Jason. Lori Campbell and her friends take Jason's body to his home turf of Crystal Lake in hopes of an advantage. Lori is able to bring Freddy out of the dreamworld and into the real world where Jason is waiting. After a back and forth battle, Freddy is physically defeated as Jason sinks to the bottom of Crystal Lake, leaving Springwood in peace to rebuild its society and environment.
