   Jesse goes outside and walks to
   Don's Place
   , where he orders a beer. He runs into his coach, Schneider, who is always punishing him. Schneider takes him to the school gym to run laps. He then orders Jesse to take a shower. Schneider gets a jumprope. The implification here is rather obvious. In the shower, Freddy uses his power from within Jesse to tie Schneider to a wall with jump ropes as Freddy takes over Jesse's body, transforming Jesse into him (minus the clawed glove, which Freddy is usually seen with, instead Freddy actually has knives coming out of his fingers). To Jesse, it seems that someone else is committing the murder. Freddy slashes Schneider in the back a few times, killing him. Afterward, he turns back into Jesse, with the clawed glove.

   Jesse returns to Lisa's house where Freddy takes control of him again and attacks Lisa and kills six guests (boiling some in the pool and burning some to death, while stabbing others). Lisa's father tries to shoot Freddy, but she stops him and follows Freddy to the power plant where he worked. Outside the power plant, she encounters two human faced dogs, for which no explanation is given. Once inside the boiler room, she encounters what appears to be a mutant cat and a mutant rat, for which no explanation is given, either. She then encounters Freddy. She tells Jesse to fight Freddy, and eventually he does. Freddy begins losing control (an injury he suffered earlier, to which he was previously immune, opens up and starts bleeding). After Lisa kisses Freddy, Jesse is able to use his power from within and start a fire, which burns Freddy to a crisp. It turns out that Jesse is inside of Freddy's burnt corpse, much like a scene in Ghostbusters from the previous year.

   . Jesse thinks the bus is moving too fast, but it stops to pick up a passenger. When all seems well, Freddy's gloved hand stabs through Kerry, and the bus drives into the desert. Whether or not this was a dream remains a mystery as Jesse doesn't get mentioned again.

   The film has generally received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Much of the negative criticism of Freddy's Revenge, from both film critics and fans, was aimed at the fact that the film, while continuing the storyline of its predecessor, takes on a completely different direction. Rather than just stalk the teenagers and kill them in their dreams, Freddy would commit random acts of violence (which he did only briefly in the first film) in the physical world, and, in the case of Schneider, against someone obviously well into adulthood. Also, very little was seen of Freddy in this film.
