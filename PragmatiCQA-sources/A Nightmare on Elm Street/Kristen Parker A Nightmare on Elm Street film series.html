Kirk always thought these experiences were normal dreams of his and never suspected a thing. However, this strange ability of Kristen's stopped manifesting when her father left the family.

   . Following his death, three Dream Demons had allowed Krueger to ability haunt the dreams of his murderers' children. Any injuries that the so-called Elm Street Children suffered in these nightmares happened in the waking world. Recently, Freddy had been killing numerous children in their sleep, and Kristen was one of his latest targets.

   One night that year, Kristen stayed up very late, under the pretense that she was waiting for Elaine to come home, but in reality she was finishing her paper-mache model of the Elm Street House, trying to ward off sleep. When she eventually fell asleep, Kristen suffered a nightmare in which she entered the Elm Street House and was chased by Freddy before entering a room full of dead teenagers. Upon waking up, Kristen went into her bathroom only to discover she was still dreaming. Freddy, disguised as the sink faucet, cut her wrist with his razors. Elaine walked in just after and saw Kristin with a razor in her hand, making it appear as an attempted suicide. Kristin falls unconscious from the blood loss and shock.

Kristen only calmed down when a woman, Nancy, looking for a job at the hospital and herself an old adversary of Freddy Krueger, came in and finished the rhyme for her. Dr. Neil Gordon was amazed how Nancy was able to relate to Kristin and gain her trust, not knowing her true history with Freddy.

   As the teenagers around her were systematically slaughtered, Kristen learnt a horrifying secret; that her parents and other parents had torched Freddy after the courts had set him free on a technicality. Thanks to her parent's actions, Freddy was now after Kristen and the gang. Nancy also informed everybody that they all possess dream powers, supernatural abilities available to them in their dreams, with Kristen's being the ability to pull people in and out of dreams. She also has the dream ability of a professional gymnast, able to perform aerial attacks and flips to combat and dodge Freddy.

   Jason
   ) into her dreams for help. Unfortunately, her suspicions aren't completely unfounded as Freddy is reanimated and begins to slaughter her friends again.

   Freddy then fights Kristen and forces her to call Alice into her dreams in order to have someone new bring him more victims. Kristen charges Freddy in order to protect Alice from him, but is grabbed by Freddy and thrown into the fiery furnace, slowly burning her to death.

Alice could only watch in horror as Freddy absorbs Kristen's soul. In reality, Kristen's room was ignited in flames.

   Kristen has the unique ability to bring people in and out of dreams and gymnastics. They manifested when she was younger, when she would bring her father into her dreams. Her father would believe that they were his dreams. Once her parents divorced, her power lied dormant, only to resurface when she calls out for Nancy. She can only pull people into her dreams as long as the person(s) is asleep. However, only Kristen can pull people out of her dreams, which can become problematic if she is sedated. Only by managing to wake herself up, can she free those in her dreams, otherwise the result will be the person(s) unable to get out, potentially living in her nightmare, she also could sense Freddy when he was close.

With this power, she has amazing speed and agility such as flipping off walls and landing perfectly and can perform aerial attacks such as flip kicks. Once she died, this ability, along with her ability to pull people into her dreams and smoking habit went to her best friend Alice Johnson.

On the same night in which Kincaid and Joey are murdered, Kristen falls asleep and encounters Freddy who chases her down a narrow passageway between the walls of his house. She tries to summon Kincaid and Joey but to no avail, unaware that Freddy already got to them. Before he can kill her, her hand bursts into flames and she wakes up, realizing that her cigarette had started a small fire.
