   is a dimension parallel to the physical world. It must be noted that in this context "world", when referring to either the physical world or the Dream World, doesn't mean planet. It means dimension. Hypothetically, the Dream World may contain all the planets, stars, galaxies, and so on the physical world does.

   It is clearly shown that objects can be pulled out of the Dream World into the physical world. It is strongly implied that objects can be pulled out of the physical world into the Dream World as well.

In the Dream World, Freddy is powerful to the point of invincibility, and is able to withstand any injury that would normally harm or kill a normal person. He is able to manipulate his victims' dreams to whatever he sees fit, mostly in the form of his victims' personality and/or fears.
