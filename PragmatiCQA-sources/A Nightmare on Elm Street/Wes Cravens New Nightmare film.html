   Just as the first Nightmare film opened with Freddy making his infamous glove, New Nightmare opens with him creating a mechanical hand. As he appears to chop off his own right hand in preparation for attaching the mechanical hand to his own right wrist, the other people on the set wince, and the director, Wes Craven, encourages the effects specialists to pump more blood. Soon he yells, "Cut! Print that Gretchen!"
   , her husband,
   , and their son,
   , are wandering around the set of the new A Nightmare on Elm Street movie.

   Presently the claw, which was only a prop a minute ago, comes to life and starts maiming and killing the special effects crew. Dylan is now gone, and as the claw advances to attack Chase, Heather screams waking up in her own bed in her own house with Chase, during an earthquake in Los Angeles. After the earthquake dies down Chase has a couple of scratches, which are the very same as he had received in the dream. This causes Heather to wonder if they were sustained in the earthquake or during the dream. Heather reveals she has been receiving harassing phone calls from "someone who sounds an awful lot like Freddy", but they've stopped for the last couple weeks until now.

   asks Heather to visit his office at New Line Cinema, and explains that Wes Craven is working on a script for the new and final "Nightmare" film. Heather is asked to reprise her role as main character "Nancy", but decides against it with her own recent nightmares, disturbing phone calls, and disgruntlement over her son's change in behavior. Bob explains that her husband Chase Porter is also working on the film and he is creating a scary new glove for Freddy, much to Heather's dismay.

   When she gets home, her son has an episode during which he warns her in a voice not of his own, "Never sleep again!" Worried, Heather asks Chase to come home, however Chase falls asleep at the wheel on the way and dies supposedly in a car crash. When Heather goes to identify the body, it seems to her that there may have been more than meets the eye to the "crash", as was made apparent by the claw-like marks on his chest. Dylan, now also grief stricken, continues acting even more strangely.

   She enlists Wes Craven's help for making sense of what's been happening. Craven explains that he does not know much more than she does. He dreams a scene or two each night and wakes up and writes them down.

  <p key="2e499b81-50df-4d76-b667-7f33f2f58bea">
   Craven goes on to tell her that in the script he's been writing, pure evil can be temporarily defeated if its essence is effectively captured in a work of art that is able to allow evil to express itself.
  </p>
  <p key="65ef77de-2a76-467b-9d43-86243bee9dda">
   Craven explains that the evil has taken the form of Freddy Krueger because it is a familiar one. "Freddy" sees her as the gatekeeper who holds Freddy at bay, since Heather's character Nancy defeated Freddy in the first movie. To Freddy it is Heather that gave the character of Nancy her fortitude. Freddy is attacking her at her weakest points, trying to break her down before confronting her, prompting her to leave just as confused as when she arrived.

   After a short sleep in Dylan's room, Heather wakes to discover Dylan is gone, she goes downstairs and finds Dylan in another episode. Heather finally takes Dylan to the hospital, there a doctor asks if Dylan said anything during his trance, Heather says "No" but the doctor later gets it out of her that Dylan has been doing Freddy-like actions and singing Freddy's theme. Later, Julie (Dylan's babysitter) shows up at the hospital and tells Heather she had a nightmare about him.

  <p key="d52e1320-3cb9-45b1-af8e-f6929d61d253">
   Heather leaves, intending to head home and return with Rex, Dylan's stuffed dinosaur, which Dylan describes to her as protecting him from a man that attacks him from beneath his bed cover. Soon after, two nurses want to sedate Dylan, but Julie has been instructed by Heather not to let Dylan fall asleep in her absence. Julie punches one nurse and threatens the other (played by Jessica Craven, the director's daughter) with a syringe. Julie locks the door to the room. Meanwhile, Heather is stopped by security guards before she can leave the hospital. Dylan's doctor questions her, intimating that Heather and Dylan both suffer from hereditary mental illness, and tries to get Heather to agree to foster care for Dylan while Heather receives treatment.

  <p key="11660bd7-2c1d-48d1-a694-7cf343b046d5">
   Dylan drifts into sleep. Freddy appears in the locked hospital room and attacks Julie, killing her. The nurses unlock the doors and discover the murder in progress, then flee. Heather returns to her son's bed, but Dylan has disappeared. Heather soon remembers that she had sought to comfort Dylan by telling him their home is right across the freeway from the hospital. She discovers Freddy, now a gigantic figure, dangling Dylan from his claws in the freeway's nighttime traffic. Heather arrives home in pursuit of Dylan, but reality begins to change around her.

Heather runs inside—discovering the familiar interior of her own home inside Nancy's—and into Dylan's room, finding only the toy dinosaur, "Rex", that Dylan believed was protecting him from his attacker. Rex lies in tatters, viciously sliced open.

   Heather, armed with a knife from her kitchen, consumes sleeping pills in an attempt to save Dylan. She enters a hot, steamy, water-logged and ruined dream-scape. Dylan finds Heather, only for Freddy to attack them both. Heather is incapacitated, and Dylan flees.

  <p key="ecb7c95b-ab98-4215-a4ba-9598efbdae27">
   Freddy lures Dylan into a trap and attacks him again. Heather reaches her son and fights off Freddy, but Freddy's tongue extends, wrapping around her face. Dylan attacks the tongue with Heather's knife, freeing his mother. Together, the two lock Freddy in a furnace and light its fire with their tormentor inside. Freddy's visage is shown amidst a fiery blast. Dylan &amp; Heather flee.

   Mother and son arrive back home. Craven's now-completed script is there as well, waiting for them. Dylan asks his mother to read some of it to him, which she does: "We open on an old wooden bench. There's fire and tools, and a man's grimy hands building what's soon revealed as a gleaming set of claws. And the claws are moving now as if awakening from a long and unwanted sleep..."

   New Nightmare failed to make a big impression at the box office as any of the previous six films—the United States take-in was only $18.6 million and became the lowest earning movie of the franchise; however, this amount was still over two times the budget. The film debuted at number 1 at the United Kingdom box office in early 1995.

   On Rotten Tomatoes, 79% of critics gave the film a positive review (making it the second highest rated Elm Street film). Several critics have subsequently said that New Nightmare could be regarded as a prelude to the Scream series—both sets of films deal with the idea of bringing horror movies to "real life". While the Scream films appealed to huge audiences, New Nightmare has gathered a smaller, fan-led cult following.

   Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Wes Craven's New Nightmare three stars out of four and said "I haven't been exactly a fan of the Nightmare series, but I found this movie, with its unsettling questions about the effect of horror on those who create it, strangely intriguing." Kevin Sommerfield from the horror website Slasher Studios gave it four out of four stars and said "New Nightmare is that rare horror film in which everything works. The performances are pitch perfect, lead by a tour-de-force performance by the amazing Langenkamp. The script is full of twists and turns and the movie is quite possibly the best looking of the entire series."

   Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman however gave Wes Craven's New Nightmare a negative review, stating "After a good, gory opening, in which Freddy's glove—newly designed with sinews and muscles—slashes the throat of the special-effects guy who's been working on it, the movie succumbs to a kind of sterile inertia. Wes Craven's New Nightmare isn't about Freddy haunting a film set, which actually might have been fun. It's about Heather Langenkamp, star of the original A Nightmare on Elm Street, being menaced for two long, slow hours by earthquakes, cracks in the wall, and other weary portents of doom." Gleiberman described the film as "just an empty hall of mirrors" that "lacks the trance-like dread of the original" and the "ingeniously demented special effects" of
