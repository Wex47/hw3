   That night, Tina, Nancy and Glen, who is Nancy's boyfriend, have a sleep-over at 620 Elm Street to make the distraught Tina feel better, as she is still troubled by her nightmare. However, as Tina describes the man in his dream, Nancy realizes that they are dreaming about the same person. He is described as being horribly burned with large finger knives that he scratches over everything. Although he registers a look of recognition himself, Glen assures them that what they are talking about is impossible.

Later, Tina apparently wakes up and hears rocks being thrown at the window. She goes outside and into an alley to investigate and at this time the burned killer reveals himself. This is the first indication that she is dreaming. After chasing her down the alleyway and to the house, the killer catches up to her in her back yard. After scaring her by cutting off two of his own fingers, he finally gets a hold on her. As he brutally murders her, Rod wakes up to find Tina being cut open by invisible knives, then dragged up the wall and across the ceiling. She then falls onto the bed. Rod, being the only other person in the room at the time, screams at the murderer. Nancy and Glen hear this out in the hallway.

Nancy insists that Rod and Tina's argument was not enough to warrant him murdering her.

   The next morning, after not sleeping, Nancy heads off to school despite the objections from her mother. She walks past a house with the number 1622. It isn't clear whether or not this house is on Elm Street. Right after this, Nancy sees a man very openly watching her. When she looks again a second later, he's gone. Another second later, she is grabbed by Rod and dragged into the bushes. Rod tries to explain what he saw and that it wasn't him that killed Tina. Although somewhat receptive to Rod's claims, Rod gets angry at Nancy and stupidly threatens her. Lt. Thompson appears in the bushes and pulls a gun on Rod forcing him to run into the street where he is arrested by other police men. Nancy, angry at her father for using her to capture Rod, angrily leaves for school.

   In class, Nancy notices Tina's corpse in a body bag standing outside the classroom. Leaving class, she finds the body bag being dragged down the hall, leaving a trail of leaked blood. Turning the corner, Nancy knocks over a girl wearing a green and red striped sweater who demands Nancy to show her hall pass. After telling the girl off and running down the hall, the girls calls out for Nancy in Freddy Krueger's voice. Looking back, Nancy sees her wearing the finger knives and instructing her not to run in the hallway. Nancy follows the trail of blood down a stairway into Springwood High School's basement.

   She goes into the boiler room, where she is attacked by the killer, finally revealing his first name which is Freddy. Realizing that she is dreaming, Nancy burns her arm on the boiler pipes to wake up. She screams in the classroom, alarming the teacher and the class.

   These nightmares cause her to talk to Rod in jail, who finishes telling her what he saw in Tina's mother's bedroom. He tells Nancy that he never saw anyone and when he first saw Tina being murdered, he assumed he was having another nightmare. When Rod mentions that all four slashes in Tina's chest happened simultaneously, Nancy finally believes Rod is innocent.

   Later at home, Nancy is taking a bath. Her mother warns her not to fall asleep and offers to make Nancy some warm milk. As Nancy drifts off in the tub, the razor glove comes out of the water a couple times and eventually pulls Nancy under the water.

   Upon returning home, Nancy sees that Marge has barred up all of the windows in the house. Upon entering the home, Marge finally reveals that Fred Krueger was a child murderer who killed at least twenty children over a decade earlier. Furious, vengeful parents burned him alive in his boiler room hideout after he was released from jail on a technicality due to an improperly signed warrant. She reassures Nancy that Krueger cannot hurt anyone, pulling Krueger's bladed glove from a hiding place in the furnace as proof.

Nancy continuously calls out for her absent father until finally the officer he had watching her gets Lt. Thompson. Freddy then chases Nancy down to the basement where she sets him on fire.

   A Nightmare on Elm Street premiered in the United States on a limited theatrical release on November 9, 1984, opening in 165 cinemas across the country. The film performed moderately well commercially with little advertising — relying mostly on commercial advertisements and word-of-mouth. Grossing US$1,271,000 during its opening weekend, the film was considered an instant commercial success. The film eventually earned a total of $26.5 million at the American box office. Additionally, A Nightmare on Elm Street was released in Europe, India, Canada and Australia.

   Since its initial release, critics have praised the film's ability to rupture "the boundaries between the imaginary and real," toying with audience perceptions. Some film historians interpreted this overriding theme as a social subtext, "the struggles of adolescents in American society". Variety said the film was "A highly imaginative horror film that provides the requisite shocks to keep fans of the genre happy".

   The original cut was rated X, and the MPAA forced Wes Craven to remove 5 seconds from Tina's death and 8 seconds from Glen's death before giving the film an R rating. Glen's death was gradually restored to Craven's original version, with 6 seconds restored for the initial home video release and the remaining 2 seconds for the DVD release, but Tina's death remains censored to this day. The uncut X-rated version was only available outside of the United States, mostly on VHS, though a rare DVD of this cut was issued in Turkey.

    The confusing ending of the movie was due to producer Robert Shaye wanting a scary ending. Wes Craven intended the movie to have a happy ending that when Nancy wakes up after defeating Freddy, she realizes the entire movie was just a dream. Shaye wanted the ending scene to actually be a nightmare. The ending the movie actually received was a compromise of the two endings.
