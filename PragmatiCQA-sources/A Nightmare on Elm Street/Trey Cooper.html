  </p>
  <p key="62450526-7934-410e-9439-fd723853b822">
   His best friend was a boy named Blake Mueller. As a teenager, he was dating a woman named Gibb Smith. Trey detested the fact that Gibb was a smoker and made it a point to verbalize his displeasure at every given opportunity.

   were both at the house at the time which Trey brought a case of beer to help spice up the evening. Upon entering the house, Gibb kissed him and Trey admonished her about kissing him after she had been smoking.
  </p>
  <p key="bb10c348-db5a-4fac-b7cc-236c61b02900">
   Later, Gibb and Trey decide to have sex in one of the bedrooms. Then, Trey summoned Gibb to him as if she were a puppy and when she didn't respond quickly enough for him he snapped, "Babe, don't make me ask you twice, okay?"
  </p>
  <p key="3774d9de-668b-4749-ae29-af03e57e0459">
   During their sexual escapade, the power to the house cut out, so they lit a few candles. When they were done, Trey told her that he doesn't like to be touched after sex which Gibb was upset about and decided to take a shower which Trey appreciated, citing that her hair smelled like Menthols.
  </p>
  <p key="56b23ee8-f5d7-4ea0-8e79-ffbab1b1fbdd">
   While Gibb was taking a shower, the masked undead serial killer known as Jason Voorhees broke into the house and made his way to the bedroom.
  </p>

   Trey was lying on his stomach with a beer in his hand and was unaware of Jason's presence which Jason stabbed him multiple times in the back with a machete and then pulled each end of the bed inwards, folding Trey's body backwards, snapping his spine.
  </p>
  <p key="2dc8686b-328c-4124-875c-326c4d46844b">
   When Gibb exited the shower, she noticed a puddle of blood pooling from underneath the door. Then, she opened the door and saw Trey's broken and folded body in a flash of lightning. Screaming in terror, she alerted the others and ran from the house.
  </p>
  <p key="d59240f6-54cf-47e4-9af7-b83edb770a0d">
   The following evening, Gibb attended a corn field rave and became highly intoxicated which she passed out in the middle of a clearing and began to dream.
