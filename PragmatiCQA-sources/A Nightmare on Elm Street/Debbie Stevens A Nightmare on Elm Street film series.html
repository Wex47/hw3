   Debbie is a tomboy, athletic, enthusiastic and forthright. Despite her tough appearance and sometimes forceful and mean girl attitude, Debbie is very kind and compassionate by nature. A girl who will not let anyone push her or her friends around, she often stands up to bullies whenever they pick on her friend Sheila, whose death has impacted on her greatly. Debbie is also short-tempered and emotional and has notably restrains Alice when she tries to warn everyone about Freddy's presence, although she eventually accepts it as a fact after the death of Rick Johnson. She also shows courage against Freddy in her final nightmare.

   Debbie is not born on Elm Street and therefore there was no indication of herself or her family knowing about the existence of Freddy Krueger. Debbie is a tomboy and academically poor, which often requires help from her best-friend Sheila, an intelligent but socially awkward student that is often targeted for bullying. Sheila would sometimes even do her homework for her when she slacks off. As return, Debbie would often defend her whenever bullying takes place.

   coming off his truck, she reveals her crush on him. Sheila then arrives on her dilapidated motorbike, Debbie walks to her excitedly and points out that her bike is worn-out and is a health hazard that causes her asthma, which Sheila tells her asthma is genetic. She then asks Sheila for helping her homework, much to Sheila’s disappointment. When Sheila takes a breath with her asthma inhaler, two school bullies mocks her, as Debbie defends Shelia as usual:

Coming back, she tells Alice and Sheila, who has just arrived in the restaurant, that Dan's really cool and cute, and she even desires to ask for his telephone number, where he works out and home address.

   While lifting a barbell on a weight lift bench, Debbie falls asleep. While dreaming, she keeps working on her muscles, until Freddy Krueger appears and grabs her barbell. She tells Freddy bravely:

   pushes the barbell down so far it breaks open her elbows. Her arms are falling off and insect legs sprout. Panicking, Debbie runs away and is later stuck on a floor of glue, later revealed to be a bug trap, she ends up face down on the glue. When attempting to pull her face away, she is still transformed into a roach as her face is torn away and an entire roach emerges from her body. She is also the only character not to die with her blood coming out of her arms as Freddy looks in the trap telling her,
