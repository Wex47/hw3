   Maggie takes John back to Springwood in hopes that it will trigger a spark to get him to remember who he is. While driving in the van, John hallucinates thinking he sees the same girl (Katherine Krueger), who yells, "GO BACK!", and nearly causes the van to crash. It is then that they discover Carlos, Spencer, and Tracy having stowed away. When they reach Springwood, Maggie tells them to call

   Meanwhile, when Maggie and John go to a school, the teacher (who is unstable and talking to imaginary kids just like all the other adult inhabitants of Springwood) mentions Freddy's child being taken away. John believes that he is that child, and that is why Freddy hasn't killed him. While at the school, they look at a collection of missing persons posters and newspaper articles relating to Freddy's pre-death serial killings. They clearly relate to younger than teenage children.

   Carlos then falls asleep inside the house and begins to dream of his mother. Freddy takes his hearing device (which he uses because his mother physically abused him and damaged his hearing ability) and magnifies it so everything is extremely loud. After tormenting him by dropping pins on the ground and scratching a chalkboard with his razor glove, he scratches it so much that Carlos's head explodes. Meanwhile, Spencer gets high and falls into a dreaming hallucination. Tracy goes to get Maggie and John as Spencer is sucked into the television by Freddy where he is in a video game and is attacked by Freddy's character who resembles his father. When Maggie, Tracy, and John get back, Tracy and John enter the dream world in an attempt to stop Freddy, but Freddy kills Spencer by knocking him into a hole that materializes in the real world. Maggie witnesses him fall into the hole.

   Maggie wakes Tracy up before Freddy can kill her and takes John away from Springwood. John, still asleep, finds himself in his house which begins to burn. He jumps out a window and activates a parachute. Freddy reveals to him that he is not his son and that he was using him to get to his daughter. He cuts the ropes of the parachute and places spikes directly below John as he falls on them. Before dying, he tells Maggie that Freddy's child is not a boy. John's body vanishes after his death. Freddy is able to enter Maggie's mind, and as they drive away from Springwood, the barrier is broken.

   When Maggie talks to Kelly, she discovers that neither he nor anyone else remembers Carlos, Spencer, or John. Doc, who is able to control his dreams, tells her that Freddy didn't just kill them; he erased them. Later, Maggie, Tracy, and Doc each have nightmares about Freddy; Maggie discovers that she is Freddy's daughter, and now he can kill more victims outside Springwood. Freddy tells Doc that the dream demons gave him his power, and Doc tears off a shred of Freddy's sweater before he wakes up.

   Maggie pulls Freddy out of the dream world, and they fight. They appear evenly matched (though Maggie knocks off Freddy's clawed glove, and later breaks his hand) until Tracy and Doc throw several weapons to Maggie and she pins him to the wall with knives and throwing stars. She then puts on his clawed glove and stabs him with it. Tracy throws her a pipe bomb and she sticks it in his chest. Doc tears the door down and the three of them escape as the bomb explodes, killing Freddy and releasing the three dream demons, who fly away.
