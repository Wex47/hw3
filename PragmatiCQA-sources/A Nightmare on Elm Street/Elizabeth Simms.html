   and were experiencing severe pattern nightmares, all of them seeing the same personification of the "Boogeyman" (Freddy), that is being dismissed by the other staffers at the hospital. It can be implied that, unlike Dr. Gordon, Dr. Simms is much more conservative in her understanding of the patients and consequently takes a harsher approach towards them. One example could be that following the death of

   (the survivor of the first movie). When Dr. Gordon suggests giving the kids a drug that prevents them from dreaming, Dr. Simms is immediately shocked. She also places quick blame to Nancy as a bad influence on Dr. Gordon. Later on in the movie, she tells Dr. Carver what has happened since Nancy showed up, telling him that she has been forming havoc among the patients which gets both Nancy and Neil relieved of duty. This said she appeared to be genuinely sorry to see Neil go and promises to listen to the children. However she does not honor this promise and continues to endanger the children.
