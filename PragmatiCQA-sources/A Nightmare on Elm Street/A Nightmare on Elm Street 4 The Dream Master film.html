   That evening, Dennis Johnson comes home and berates Alice for the vegetable meal that she prepared for him.

Freddy then resurrects from the ground. Jason whimpers and runs away, while Kincaid stays. (Apparently, Kincaid's dog is smarter than he is.) Kincaid knocks a pile of junked cars down on Freddy. Freddy quickly recoups and attacks Kincaid by stabbing him through his abdomen. Though Kincaid received four fatal wounds to his stomach, he defiantly utters "I'll see you in hell". Freddy stabs him in the abdomen much deeper for three more times to finish the job.

   Later that night, Joey is attacked and killed by Freddy on his waterbed after being tricked into seeing a naked woman swimming within it. The following day at school, Kristen is concerned when her friends fail to show up for class. She confides to Alice about her nightmares. After she learns of the deaths of Kincaid and Joey, Kristen goes to the actual Elm Street house, with Rick, Dan, and Alice. Rick tells Dan the story of Freddy, and Alice reveals a part of a rhyme by the name of The Dream Master. Alice suggests to Kristen that she is in control of her own dreams. However, Alice also looks down at the ground and sees something, a sidewalk chalk drawing of the house, that only Kristen was able to see. This time, the roof of the house points

   At Kristen's house, her mother puts sleeping pills into her drink so she will get some sleep. Angry, Kristen tells her mother that she just murdered her, runs upstairs and falls asleep. Remembering Alice's advice, she tries to convert nightmares into pleasant dreams. At first this works, and she proceeds to dream about a sandy beach. There she meets a child named Alice creating a sand castle. Freddy appears and ruins her dream, eventually taking Kristen to his boiler room. It is explained that Kristen is the last child from Elm Street, and Freddy needs her help to get more children. Freddy taunts her long enough to make her scream for Alice. Alice suddenly appears in the boiler room. Kristen tries to get her to wake up but to no avail and apologizes to her. Krueger attempts to kill Kristen's friend in front of her, but she jumps in front of Alice. Freddy throws Kristen into a furnace and collects her soul along with the other Dream Warriors. Before Kristen dies, she sends her power to pull people into her dreams to Alice but first it passes through Freddy. This allows him to imprint a part of himself onto Alice.

   Alice awakens immediately and realizes that Kristen is in danger. She and Rick both quickly make their way to Kristen's house. Outside, they see flames coming from Kristen's room, and they are too late to save her. As Alice tries to understand what has happened, and who Freddy is, her friends begin to die.

   The next day at school, Alice talks to Sheila in the bathroom. Sheila hadn't slept either, although her sleeplessness was caused by cramming for a physics test. When Sheila leaves, Alice puts a cigarette in her mouth and is about to light it when she realizes that she doesn't smoke. Kristen did, however.

   While taking the test, Alice falls asleep in class and accidentally pulls Sheila into her dream where Freddy is waiting. He traps Alice in her desk chair so she cannot help her friend and taunts Sheila before sucking all the air out of her lungs through her mouth. Alice awakens, only to discover Sheila having an asthma attack. Sheila then dies after her inhaler fails to provide her with the air she needs. Rick begins to believe there might be some truth in the Freddy story.

   Later, Rick falls asleep in a bathroom stall and finds himself fighting an invisible Freddy. Rick holds his own, even going as far as to knock Freddy's glove off his hand. The glove stirs and soon launches at Rick and stabs him in the chest. At Rick's funeral, Alice at first daydreams that Rick is still alive. However, she realizes that she can't daydream her way through life and she has to face reality. However, she finds that she has picked up traits from all of her friends when they died. She received Kristen's powers and part of her personality, Sheila's ingenuity and Rick's assertiveness and martial arts ability.

   Together with Dan, Alice tries to get to Debbie, their last surviving friend, before Freddy finds her. Unbeknown to the two teens, Freddy is able to control their movements. Trapping Alice and Dan in a time loop, Freddy is able to reach Debbie and kill her by transforming her into a cockroach and trapping her inside a roach motel and then crushing her before Alice and Dan intervene. Following a car accident, where Dan is injured and rushed to the hospital, he is placed under sedation. Alice returns home to prepare for one final battle with Freddy and to help Dan before Freddy can kill him. As Alice and Dan search for Freddy, Dan is injured. Dan is awoken from sedation and pulled from the Dream World by the Doctors trying to help him in the real world. Alice, facing Freddy alone, attempts to use all of her newly absorbed abilities against him.

   The fight is relatively equal, with Alice dealing blows that slow Freddy down. Ultimately, his immortality is an advantage that proves nearly too great to overcome. He declares that he has been guarding his gate for too long to be taken down by her. But just as he is preparing to kill her, she recalls the final verse of the Dream Master rhyme. For the first time, someone defeats Freddy by using the power to make him see the evil that is inside. Using her power as guardian of the gate of good dreams, Alice releases the tortured souls that Freddy imprisoned into the gates of good dreams where he can no longer harm them. Krueger's clothes fall lifelessly to the floor and Alice kicks his glove. The film ends with Dan and Alice at a fountain some time later. Dan tosses a coin into a fountain and before the coin falls into the water, she briefly sees the reflection of Freddy. Alice brushes this off and she and Dan continue to walk through the park.
