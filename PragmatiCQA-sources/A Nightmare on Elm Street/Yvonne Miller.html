   Yvonne makes her first appearance at the graduation of Springwood High School along with her friends Alice, Mark, Greta and Dan. She tells his friends he is responsible for locking the pool door after her diving practice tonight, hence implying they will have a moon party there once it is finished.
  </p>
  <p key="7b591774-ae7d-4675-a6de-40d3ec28c97b">
   Later that night at the moon party, Yvonne makes a dive into a pool. She then joins her friends apart from Alice being absent as she is supposed to have work. Greta complains that her mother controls her too much and wishes to be free, Mark connects this to his comic book character which makes everyone believe he is weird. Dan receives a phone call by Alice and leaves the pool. This, however, is the last time Yvonne has seen him, as later that night, Dan died in a traffic accident.
  </p>
  <p key="c8019781-9bb0-478f-9254-7b39b0bb9c2e">
   Alice passes out after witnessing Dan's death, as Yvonne sits next to her hospital bed all night until she wakes up. She comforts her and tells her she is now pregnant with Dan's baby. The following day afterwards Alice asks her if there is a young boy with sad eyes around the hospital, but Yvonne tells her that there is no children's ward, nor were there any children on her floor. Alice then gathers Yvonne, Mark and Greta into her house, telling them about Freddy Krueger's history and warning them he is coming back, which Yvonne, along with the others, does not believe at all.

  <p key="c6ef8132-cc8a-4654-91a3-ac9003946c48">
   After Greta's death, she and Alice finds a saddened Mark in his father's warehouse. Yvonne remains convinced that Greta's death was an accident, as Mark yells at her to get out, but quickly apologizes for this as Yvonne forgives him, but she shortly leaves to work a shift at the pool.

   The following day, Alice calls her in a favor with the Doctor overseeing for Ultrasounds to have the screening of her unborn baby. In the middle of the process, Alice suddenly paranoids as Yvonne takes her home. Convinced that Freddy Krueger is just an hallucination caused by the trauma of Dan's death, Yvonne and Alice then has an argument about Alice's sanity. Mark arrives at Alice's house with the information he researched earlier about Amanda Krueger, he defends Alice which resulted in Yvonne leaving in frustration.

   Later, Yvonne falls asleep while in the Springwood High School's Pool area bathing in a Jacuzzi, and she was attacked and almost killed by Freddy Krueger. Her nightmare oversees her jump from a diving board as monstrous arms overtake the platform and she is saved by Alice, who discovers her in danger and stabs an iron stick through Freddy's mouth, stopping him from drowning Yvonne in a boiler water pit.
