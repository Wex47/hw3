Afterwards she goes to take a shower, but the shower began losing control and the water flies everywhere until the bathroom is filled. Alice almost drowns but thanks to her dream power, she is able to escape in time. As she flies out of the water filled shower she discovers she is in a strange asylum. She walks for a moment naked seeing doors open. She finds herself in nun's clothing with a name tag saying

   As Alice walks to work she finds herself in a dark part of the park where she sees Amanda and follows her back to the asylum. Inside Alice is knocked onto a gurney and is then wheeled into an operating room, wearing Amanda's uniform and screaming in pain. She sat up screaming and was suddenly standing to one side and as Alice looks around she sees Amanda Krueger on the table instead of herself, giving birth. As the baby is delivered, Amanda clamors to get to the newly resurrected, yet powerless, Freddy. The mother superior tells Amanda that it is "One of God's creatures" before the demonic baby breaks free from the doctors and escapes the room.

At this time, Amanda shows up to help Alice, but is disrupted when Freddy slams the church doors closed on her. After these events, Alice finds herself at work, but four hours late, somehow dreaming while awake.

   Alice immediately phones Dan who leaves their friends and rushes over to the diner. Before Dan can make it to her, he falls asleep (though Alice is awake) and is attacked by Freddy. Eventually he rides a motorcycle away, but Freddy fuses him with the wires of the motorcycle, and forces him to crash into another vehicle (making him crash his truck in the real world, and with the fragments of the bottle of champagne he had for Alice, making some suspect he was driving drunk). At the hospital, she is informed that she is pregnant with Dan's child. While recouping, she meets a young boy,

   Freddy begins to kill Alice's friends one by one as they fall asleep. One night at dinner, while Alice is home and awake, Greta is pulled into the dream world and killed by Freddy, who stuffs food and her own guts in her mouth, causing her to choke to death. Yvonne refuses to believe Freddy exists, but Mark, on the other hand, finds it odd that two of them died around the same time. Soon, Freddy goes after Mark, and after Alice draws herself into Mark's dream and saves Mark in time from being dropped into a hellish pit. Mark starts to believe Alice does some research on Freddy. She also discovers that Jacob is her unborn child, and Freddy is using his dreams to pull his victims into the dream world for him. Hence why she is dreaming while awake. Alice requests an early ultrasound for her baby, and soon realizes that Freddy is using her dream power, through her child, to pull her friends into Freddy's world.

   The next day, Alice and Mark try their best to convince Yvonne that Freddy is real, but Yvonne leaves angrily with tears on her face. In Mark's bedroom, he tells Alice that according to his research, Amanda Krueger hung herself after Freddy's trial, but no body was ever found. They reason that she must be released from her earthly resting place in the tower of The Hathaway House. While Alice is looking for Amanda's body, Yvonne is pulled into the dream world and is attacked by Freddy, he almost kills her but is stopped when Alice stabs him in the mouth with a pipe. He refuses to go into the next room because he is afraid of Amanda. Yvonne is now convinced of Freddy's existence and accepts what Alice has been telling her.

   After Mark's death, Alice's father (who is no longer drinking) takes her home, so she tells Yvonne to go to the now-abandoned asylum and release Amanda's spirit from the tower. Alice then enters the dream world and fights off Freddy, impaling him on spikes and throwing him into a room full of a hundred maniacs (Alice uses her Dream Master power to create them and controls them to defeat Freddy Krueger). They attack him and tear his arm off, but his arm suddenly turns into tarantulas. Seemingly defeated, Freddy pulls her into his

   Yvonne, meanwhile, enters the tower and releases Amanda's spirit, where she enters the dream world and tells Jacob that Alice will not triumph and he must use his power on Freddy. Jacob shoots what appears to be a tongue beam at Freddy, and the souls of Dan, Greta, and Mark are released. Freddy is turned back into an infant, as is Jacob and are absorbed by Amanda and Alice, respectively. Amanda walks through a door into a light as Freddy attempts to claw his way out, and the church doors close. They are finally at peace from their nightmares.

   The graduation sequence was considerably cut down, which included Alice's father giving her the camera. As a result, there are a number of minor continuity errors such as Alice holding airplane tickets moments before Dan gives them to her as a surprise gift. An unrated version of the film was originally released on VHS and Laserdisc. This version contained longer, more graphic versions of Dan, Greta, and Mark's death scenes. In Dan's scene, cables can be seen sliding under the skin of Dan's arm, a large piece of the bike pierces his leg, and the skin on Dan's head is much more graphically torn off while he screams in pain. In Greta's scene, Freddy slices open a doll that begins to bleed and Greta is shown to have a gaping wound in her stomach, from which Freddy starts to feed her to death. Also Mark's demise when Freddy starts to kill him was originally slightly extended.
