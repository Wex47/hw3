Will was then committed to Westin Hills Psychiatric Hospital along with several other kids from Elm Street who had been having similar nightmares.

   Due to the severity of the situation, Neil Gordon agreed to allow Nancy to talk to the children about Freddy Krueger. Although they doubted her at first, when she described Freddy to them, they realized that she knew she was telling the truth.

   Freddy separated all of the Dream Warriors almost immediately upon them entering the Dream World. Will found himself standing at the end of a tunnel, with Freddy on the opposite end. Freddy had a torturous looking wheelchair and he sent it after Will, mocking Will's ability to walk saying "When you wake up in reality, back you go!" Will donned his Wizard Master robes and used a spell to destroy the demonic wheelchair.

   Freddy appeared shocked at Will's power. Will then cast the demon banishment spell from his Wizard Master game: "In the name of Lowrek, Prince of Elves, demon, begone!" The spell appeared to hurt Freddy and Will confidently charged at him. Freddy, however, had merely feigned being hurt by the spell. He grabbed a shocked Will, lifted him in the air and told Will: "Sorry, kid, I don't believe in fairy tales." Freddy then stabbed Will in the heart with his glove, killing him.
