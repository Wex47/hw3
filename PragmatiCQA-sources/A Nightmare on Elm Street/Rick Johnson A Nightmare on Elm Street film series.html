   Rick is outgoing, playful and cheerful, much opposed to his quiet sister. He is also shown to have a strong passion for martial arts, having a part of his home's outdoor garage turned into his own training gym.

   Rick shares a very close relationship with his Alice Johnson. He is shown to be a caring brother, such as defending her in front of their father several times; teaching her how to defend herself and encourages her to be more active. In fact, he even tries to introduce Dan to Alice, whom she has a crush on. Rick also cares greatly for Kristen, this can be shown when he openly stands up for her when she is being scolded by Kincaid, whom he dislikes; her death has impacted him greatly.

   Rick passes out in the bathroom stall at Springwood High and finds himself captured in a deadly dream. First, he is interrupted in the stall by cheerleaders with pom-poms, his sister Alice watching on in bewilderment. The cheerleaders back up, pulling Alice away with them. Moving out of the stall, he walks out into a dilapidated urban studio floor, coming to sees Kristen in the mirror across the hall, and she turns to him to reveal her face blackened and charred. Falling back, the stall has turned into a graffiti covered rusted elevator that falls fast.

Cocky once he gets the upperhand by honing in on Freddy and knocking off his glove, Rick taunts him. However, Freddy makes his glove lift from the floor and fly across the room, stabbing Rick in the chest, killing him. He absorbs Rick's soul and gets his dream power.

    It's curious although not born as an Elm Street child, Rick seems to know about the history of Freddy Krueger, he even tells this to Dan, who is new to the town. It's possible he doesn't know about Freddy's existence until Kristen tells this to him before she takes them to the Elm Street House.
