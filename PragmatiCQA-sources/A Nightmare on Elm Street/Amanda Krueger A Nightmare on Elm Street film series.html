   In 1925, at the age of 18, Amanda worked as a nun at The Hathaway House (also known as Westin Hills Asylum). Her name was Amanda Krueger, but she changed it to Sister Mary Helena as her name in Christ.

  <p key="a923ebb8-556d-4f07-8454-77560f581704">
   In December, 1941, (just a few days before Christmas), Amanda was accidentally locked in the tower when the guards hurried to go home to their families. Amanda was left alone with the crazy inmates for several days and was brutally beaten and raped. When she was finally found, Amanda was barely alive and pregnant.

Freddy was released on a technicality and Amanda was so distraught that she committed suicide shortly after she heard the news. Amanda's body was never found until decades later by a nurse named
