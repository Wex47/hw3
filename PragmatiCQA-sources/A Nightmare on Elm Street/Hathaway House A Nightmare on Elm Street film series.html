   In the 1940s, this building was maintained by a Catholic sisterhood. At the time it was presumably the state asylum as well due to its size.
  </p>
  <p key="752b2fda-6052-4e55-8d1e-b744de6cdfa4">
   It was closed some time after the same Sister hung herself in the tower several years later. Beyond that not much is known about the asylum other then a few fun facts. It is presumed that it was built under the direction of a Dr. Hathaway around the turn of the century, but no evidence has been found to support that claim.

   The actual date of Fairview Hospital closing is presumed to be some time between ANoEs3 (as Dr. Gordon mentioned that if Westin is unable to help anyone they are transfered to Fairview) and ANoES5. (When Yvonne Miller has to visit it to locate Sister Mary Helena's corpse.)

    Westin Hills Psychiatric Hospital was built in the late 1980s and some of its architecture was similar to The Hathaway House, though it was much smaller and several key structures (like two of the three towers) were omitted.
