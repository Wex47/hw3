   came to work at Westin, Freddy took over Phillip's body while all the patients were asleep for the night. Kincaid noticed Phillip walking up and out of the room but assumed he was only sleepwalking. When Phillip wouldn't answer Kincaid's attempts to wake him up, Kincaid just went back to sleep. However, within Phillip's dream, Freddy was controlling Phillip's movements by using his tendons like puppet strings. Freddy ultimately killed Phillip by making him sleepwalk out of the room and to the balcony where he fell to his death. Kincaid, along with the other patients, mourned his death while fearing for their own lives.

Nancy told the kids that each of them had a power in the dreams and they underwent group hypnosis in an attempt to discover that power. Thinking that they failed to enter group hypnosis, the group takes a break. Kincaid discovered that his dream power was incredible strength, which he demonstrated by bending the legs of a chair back and forth; much to the chagrin of Dr. Gordon.

   Due to Joey becoming trapped in the dream by Freddy Krueger, Neil and Nancy were fired from Westin Hills, leaving Simms in charge of the group. This led to Kristen having a fit and being confined to the quiet room and sedated. Nancy returned to Westin Hills and got the remaining Elm Street children, including Kincaid, together for one last group hypnosis session. Kincaid was the last of the patients to confirm he was ready to take on Freddy by saying, "Let's go kick the motherfucker's ass all over dreamland."

Off-screen, Kincaid fough his way through Freddy's traps with his dream power of super strength and met up with Nancy and Kristen who then fought against Freddy in the boiler room and saved Joey.

Kincaid, Nancy, Kristen and Joey found themselves in a hallway full of mirrors which all reflected Freddy.

Kincaid sees his pet dog Jason in the middle of the junk yard, but it is only a representation of the dog, not the real animal pulled in as before. The dog pees fire on the ground where Freddy was buried and opens the floor revealing Freddy's bones, which begins Freddy's resurrection. Kincaid attempts to kill Freddy by pushing a car off a junk yard stack onto him, but Freddy cannot be defeated so easily.
