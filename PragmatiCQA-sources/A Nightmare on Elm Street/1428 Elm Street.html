Children dressed in white clothes, implied to be some of Freddy's pre-death victims, would usually be seen outside the house playing jump rope and singing the Freddy Krueger jump rope song. (However, in Freddy's Revenge, Angela Walsh jumps rope and sings this song in a dream Jesse has, and she obviously WASN'T one of Freddy's pre-death victims and was very much alive.) Inside the house it's dark and unsettling quiet. Downstairs in the basement is the boiler room where Freddy used to take his young victims and kill them in his former life and usually waits for his next victims to show up down there. It was strongly indicated that the house was occupied by Freddy before the Thompsons moved in, however it's not been confirmed.
