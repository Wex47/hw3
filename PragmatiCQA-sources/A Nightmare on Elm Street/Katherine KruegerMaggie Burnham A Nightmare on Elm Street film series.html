After Loretta promised that "she won't tell," she was strangled to death by Freddy in front of a 6-year old Katherine for "snooping in daddy's special work." In 1966, Freddy was arrested for the murders of the missing children and Kathryn was put into foster care and was later adopted by the Burroughs family. Her records were subsequently sealed and she was moved away from

   After a decade of slaughtering all the children of Springwood in their dreams, there were no children left. The remaining adults were kept in a mass psychosis after their children had been murdered. When there was no one left to kill, Freddy sought to leave Springwood, hoping to continue his murder spree in another town, that was full of more children. Only one person could arrange for this— Kathryn, his long-lost daughter. He used what was left of his supernatural powers to find his daughter, who he learned was an adult named Maggie Burroughs. Maggie worked as a counselor with troubled teens in another city. After her mother's death, Maggie was adopted and raised by adoptive parents. She had suppressed the horrible memories of her early childhood.
