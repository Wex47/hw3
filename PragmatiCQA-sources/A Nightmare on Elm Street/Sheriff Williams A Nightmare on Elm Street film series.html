   Williams was the sheriff of
   <a href="Springwood County A Nightmare on Elm Street film series.html" key="af7290fc-fe7d-4821-b882-e43353a124f6" title="Springwood County (A Nightmare on Elm Street film series)">

   in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Along with other members of law-enforcement as well as the administrative staff of Westin Hills Psychiatric Hospital, Sheriff Williams was part of a conspiracy to make everyone in town forget the name Freddy Krueger.
  </p>
  <p key="c0b3ce00-9dbb-48da-926c-1cb77e3121c4">
   Fully aware that Fred Krueger was a demonic entity that could kill people in their dreams, he believed that by removing all knowledge of him, he could then take away his power.
  </p>
  <p key="172d86c1-eb73-4b04-a388-0aced48fbe9d">
   To a large extent, Sheriff Williams was correct in this belief. He orchestrated the removal of any and all record of there ever having been a man named Freddy Krueger from all media sources.
  </p>
  <p key="2b73be5a-9739-4743-8351-7ffa10e32b8d">
   In 2003, Freddy Krueger tried to regain his power by making the people of Springwood know fear again.
  </p>
  <p key="fd37b803-ffa5-4b9e-af4e-3056093dad48">
   Unable to take direct action at this time, he resurrected the essence of an undead serial killer named
   <a href="Jason Voorhees Friday the 13th film series.html" key="c9da8f94-8efb-48fe-ae83-e0c6b41ea40d" title="Jason Voorhees (Friday the 13th film series)">

   and sent him to Springwood on a killing spree.
  </p>
  <p key="7eebe8c9-6248-4b77-b334-6f75ed433e68">
   Then, Jason broke into the house at 1428 Elm Street and murdered a teenager named Trey Cooper. One of the residents of the house,
   <a href="Lori Campbell.html" key="4eb86a19-58d9-4e9f-ab22-cfa69940492a" title="Lori Campbell">

   , was brought down to the police station for questioning. Sheriff Williams confused Lori by asking her questions about her dreams.
  </p>
  <p key="190889cb-7500-43a8-80e6-eb6c348d788b">
   One of Williams' deputies, a newly-hired out-of-towner named Scott Stubbs tried to ask him about Freddy Krueger, but Williams warned him against pursuing such a line of questioning, noting that they do things a little differently in Springwood than what Stubbs might be accustomed to.
