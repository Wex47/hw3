   Being an obvious comic book geek, it was clear Mark had plans to work in comics. He was a very good artist and was hoping to become a comic book artist, and even began making a small comic of his own to debut with, an independent black and white graphic comic by the name of "The Phantom Prowler", detailing the account of a super violent anti-hero who fought and scoured the criminal underworld in its shadows for justice. Along with working on its first issue, Mark's family wealth and connections likely netted him commercial merchandising for its initial release, including a custom made patch detailed on his vest.

   That night, he joined a moon party along with Dan and Greta. They were quickly joined by Yvonne, who had just finished a dive. He praised Yvonne for her excellent diving skills. As they conversed, Greta complained her mother always controlled her and wanted to be free. Mark connected Greta's story with his comic characters, making everyone believe he was weird. When Dan got called off for a phone call, he told everyone not to touch his champagne, but he then touched it after Dan leaves, causing everyone to laugh. After Dan came back from the call, he took his outfit and prepared to leave. Mark speculated it's Alice who called him. As Dan left the scene, he described Dan as

   After Dan's death, Mark wasn't willing to believe Alice about Freddy. Days later, Greta suddenly died at the dinner table. Alice and Yvonne found Mark in his father's warehouse, deeply upset. The trio discussed Greta's death as Alice told them it's Freddy, and that he was able to attack Greta when she was awake. Yvonne called this ridiculous and Mark yelled at her to get out. But he quickly caught up with Yvonne and apologized for this as Yvonne accepted.

   Mark asked Alice to tell him about the history of Freddy Krueger. Discovering that Mark appeared tired, Alice went to the kitchen and made a cup of coffee for him, but Mark fell asleep before Alice returned to his bedroom. He was taken to the dream world of 1428 Elm Street and was almost killed by Freddy. Fortunately, Alice saved him from falling into a hellish pit. After waking and seeing a gash wound on his hand, Mark finally came around to believing Alice and helped her by doing research on Freddy Krueger and

   The next day, Mark went to Alice's house with the information he researched earlier about Amanda Krueger, only to find out Alice and Yvonne were having an argument about Freddy's nightmares. He defended Alice which resulted in Yvonne leaving in frustration. Alice and Mark were then called down stairs by Alice's father where Dan's parents tried to persuade Alice to let them adopt her son Jacob.

   At his father's warehouse, Mark told Alice that Amanda was never actually buried. Alice concluded she needed to enter her dream to find Amanda in the tower of Asylum, where her soul was locked in and release her. Alice then fell asleep in hopes of finding Amanda. She told Mark to wake her in time, but unfortunately, Mark fell asleep.

   While trying to stay awake to help Alice catch Freddy, Mark falls asleep and is pulled into the dream world. This world is black and white like indie comics, with only Mark in full color. Freddy taunts Mark with Greta's body and then shows her as a broken doll. Enraged, Mark awakens his dream power and transforms into his comic hero "The Phantom Prowler", shooting Freddy several times. However, Freddy transforms into "Super Freddy", impervious to Mark's bullets, and regains the upper hand.

   Freddy then switches back to his regular form and turns Mark into paper and shreds him to pieces. In the physical world, his death is made to look like a horrific warehouse accident as he is crushed by a collapsed shelf and its heavy contents, and his dream death is depicted on the previously blank comic panels.

   Alice awakens to find her dead friend's body. Like Greta and Dan, Mark's soul (through Jacob) was given to Freddy to increase his power and Krueger also gets his dream power but for some reason, doesn't use it. At the end of the film though, with Amanda Krueger's help, Jacob soon uses his powers on Freddy. His soul and the souls of Dan and Greta were trying to get out of Freddy, and all 3 are successful into getting out, thus helping to defeat Freddy.
