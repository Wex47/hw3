She falls asleep, dreaming that she sneaks out and winds up at the movie theater. A gust of wind picks up inside the theater and soon becomes a spinning vortex that sucks her into the movie theater screen. Here she has a face-to-face encounter with the dreamstalker, who tells Alice to bring him more victims. Because of Freddy's manipulation of her power, Debbie becomes the next target.

He climbs up again and uses his claws to slice across Alice's torso, and beats her on the church ground. Alice manages to escape his grasp, remembers the Dream Master rhyme, inciting the souls of Freddy's victims to escape his body into the realm of good dreams.

   Alice has an unofficial appearance in novel side stories. A few years have passed since #5, Alice and a more grown Jacob have returned to Springwood in order to finish up her father's belongings after he died (implied to be by Freddy) Alice is uneasy by returning but eventually reunites with Yvonne who is now a police officer.

   Alice was the Dream Master, or the guardian of the positive gate, the gateway to good

   dreams. And as such, she had the power (and responsibility) to guard the sleeper whilst they dreamed.
  </p>
  <p key="7447f252-273f-4ec4-a9e2-e511f0d9a477">
   Being the Dream Master, Alice had the unique ability to absorb the dream powers of Freddy's most recent victims. Whenever Freddy killed and absorbed the soul of one of her friends, she would automatically absorb that very same victim's dream power. A unique side-effect of Alice's Dream Master power was that it also worked to some extent outside of the dream, or whenever she was awake. For example, after Kristen was killed by Freddy and her soul absorbed, Alice began to say and do things that were normally attributed to Kristen (smoking for example). She later began to repeat the mottoes of her friends, such as "we've got matching luggage," "mind over matter," or her brother's battle cry of "banzai!". So it can be assumed that her Dream Master power had some strong empathic attributes. 
Alice later uses most, if not all, of the dream powers she absorbed from Freddy's victims during her battle with him. She most notably used her brother's dream power of karate mastery and Sheila's power to charge the sound frequency device to shoot a powerful sonic laser beam through Freddy's abdomen. It can also be assumed she used Kristen's dream power of gymnastics mastery as she performed Olympic-level aerial flips and back flips during her fight with Freddy.
  </p>
  <p key="7dd1a17d-1364-4284-8a08-d2536b54b659">
   On an important note, Alice also wielded some ability to guard the dreamer whilst they dreamed. This was shown when Kristen was dreaming and she meets a little girl outside of Nancy's old house and on the beach. This little girl was in fact a younger version of Alice that acted as a remnant of her dream guardian power. This version of Alice didn't display much power, other than having the ability to possibly sense Freddy's incoming presence. Aside from Kristen, Alice never acted as a direct guardian for other dreamers whilst they slept. The exact reason for this is unknown.
  </p>
  <p key="bcfde8ef-413d-4d1f-8302-8a1b522289d0">
   Before she died, Kristen also passes on her  telepathic power to pull people into her dreams to Alice as a last minute resort to help Alice defend herself against Freddy. However, the power flowed into Freddy first before passing into Alice,because of this each time Alice dreamed, she would accidentally pull one of her closest loved ones into the dream with her, thus allowing Freddy to easily devour her friends' souls. This power hindered Alice for the most part of the movie before she fully embraced her Dream Master power to defeat Freddy.

   , but this time Freddy is also hiding in her body, waiting for his chance. After Alice becomes pregnant with Jacob, Freddy quickly gets into Jacob's mind, connects his dreams to Alice, and uses Alice's dream power to bring him victims.
  </p>
  <p key="865ea352-a66d-4952-93e6-bf0ac935cc75">
   Because of the many feats she was able to perform with her Dream Master power, Alice is easily one of the more powerful characters introduced. She was Freddy's supernatural opposite in the dream world. While Freddy absorbed souls, Alice too would grow stronger with each death by absorbing someone's dream power, which finally makes her from a normal daydreamer, into a Nightmare Legend.
