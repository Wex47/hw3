   Later that night, after recovering, Lori is in a cornfield at the rave with Kia and Gibb. While Kia is off getting them drinks, she is approached by Linderman. He offers to get her a drink but is again interrupted by Kia, who returns with a drink. Kia then continues to insult Linderman, who finally stands up to her while Lori stands by with a surprised but impressed look on her face.

  <p key="fe489b20-6802-494c-8356-1973aee6f99b">
   Lori then spots Will at the rave. In order to keep Linderman occupied (and likely respecting him now for standing up to her), Kia invites him to dance. Will then talks to Lori and explains that he has been at Westin Hills ever since he left. He tries to explain to her about when he saw Lori's dad murder her mom, but they are interrupted by Kia who convinces them to dance.

   While they are dancing, Jason Vorhees shows up at the cornfield and immediately kills two students,

   and an unnamed teammate of his. Shack is murdered in plain sight, with a flaming machete thrown through his body. Immediately, Jason, covered in flames descends upon the rave, causing massive carnage. Kia, Will, Linderman and Lori rush out of the rave, spotting Gibb's body on the way out. However, they are unable to mourn right away due to the presence of Jason.

   After Will drops off all of the other friends at their homes, he and Lori stop outside of Lori's house in Mark's van in the rain. Lori wants to go inside, but Will explains to her that her dad killed her mom. Lori is unsure how to react until Dr. Campbell shows up and bangs on her window, demanding her to get out of the car. Will gets out of the car and is attacking by Dr. Campbell. Lori, frustrated and scared, runs into the house.
  </p>
  <p key="27b6a224-4500-47af-8cbf-ee27fa439d39">
   On her way up the stairs, Lori is stopped by her father. She asks Dr. Campbell if her mother did die in a car accident and he says that she did. Lori then asks for proof in the form of a death certificate. She also asks if he works at Westin Hills and Dr. Campbell confirms that he has done consulting there. Shocked and realizing that her father knew about Will being committed all these years, Lori demands to know why her father has been lying to her. Dr. Campbell suggests that they are both too tired and that they should talk about it in the morning. He offers her pills to help her sleep. Lori, however, tells her father that she doesn't want to sleep. Dr. Campbell responds by saying they will talk about it in the morning and orders her to do as he says.
  </p>
  <p key="280ad575-5cbe-4ca4-8986-98982a726ced">
   Lori, now convinced that she cannot trust her father, runs up the stairs and locks herself in her room. She exits the house through the window as her father tries to break down the door. She runs into Will and the two leave in the van. Convinced that they cannot trust any of the adults, Will suggests that they go and find Mark due to the fact that he is the expert on Freddy.
  </p>
  <p key="ed90ab94-beda-41eb-afcf-45d43c789ce3">
   Lori and Will go to find Mark but they arrive when Mark is sleeping and being attacked by Freddy. Before their eyes, Mark's face is slashed and his body is set on fire. Freddy writes "Freddy's Back" ironically on Mark's back in burned flesh.

   into Mark's basement to discuss what they need to do about Freddy and Jason. Unbeknownst to her, Lori falls asleep while sitting on the couch. Her friends decide to tie her up and sacrifice her to Freddy. When they try, her father appears and tries making out with her but reveals himself to be Freddy. Lori grabs his ear, screaming, and is woken up by her friends. She had pulled Freddy's ear out of the dream and she drops it on the floor where it turns to maggots. Deputy Stubbs, who had showed up to help, stomps the maggots out. Will mentions Hypnocil and the friends look it up and discover it is a pill that suppresses dreams. The group decides to go to Westin Hills to look for Hypnocil.

  <p key="44d64d06-7186-4af2-b61b-f5c6d0aaed53">
   At the hospital, the team splits up. Will and Lori come across a string of comatose patients who never stopped dreaming and were given too much Hypnocil. Lori, disgusted by this, wonders who could have done such a horrible thing. Will informs her that her father's name is on one a patient chart, much to her horror. They continue to explore and eventually find Freeburg, possessed by Freddy, pouring all the Hypnocil into a sink. Jason then attacks, causing the friends to flee. Freeburg, still possessed by Freddy, empties two synergies of tranquilizers into Jason, putting the masked killer to sleep. This costs Freeburg his life, however, as Jason cleaves him in half being falling unconscious.

   They all load Jason into the van and proceed to take him to Crystal Lake. Lori's plan is to go into her dream and pull Freddy out. Her hope is that Jason will win and with Freddy defeated, Jason would have no reason to return to Elm Street.

   Lori takes some tranquilizer and goes into the Dream World. She witness Jason's death at Camp Crystal Lake, although she sees Freddy at the camp trying to kill him. Jason eventually wakes up and is pulled out of the dream. Seeing Lori, Freddy then switches his focus to her. Although she grabs him, he teleports her in the dream to her house. Entering the house, Lori sees her father trying to kill her mother. At the last minute, however, it is revealed to her that Freddy was killing her mother and Dr. Campbell was attempting to attack Freddy with a knife.

   While Will tries to wake Lori up, she is captured by Freddy who is about to kill her. Jason attacks the cabin Lori is in and it is set on fire. While having her body dragged out, Lori's hand falls into the fire. This causes her to wake up and she grabs Freddy and pulls him out of the dream.

   In between fights with Jason, Freddy eventually meets up with Lori and makes to kill her for bringing him out of the dream world. He is distracted by Kia, though, which gives Lori and Will a chance to run. They go over to a peer and cover it with kerosene. They set fire to the peer and watch as Freddy and Jason rip each other apart. An explosion blows them both into the water.

  <p key="8ddb5f2a-74b9-4cf7-b602-2977b42742a8">
   Thinking the fight is over, Lori and Will hold each other. They then hear footsteps approach and look up to see Freddy holding Jason's machete. Freddy is about to kill Lori until Jason pops out of the water and impales Freddy with his own glove still attached to his severed arm. As Jason falls back into the water, Freddy drops the machete and falls to his knees. Lori then picks the machete up, yells "Welcome to my world, bitch!" and decapitates Freddy. His head and body fall into the water. Will and Lori then leave what's left of the campground, wounded but alive.
