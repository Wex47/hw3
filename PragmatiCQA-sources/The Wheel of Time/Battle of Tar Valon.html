Although the 'weapon' was not used again in the following months as their grip on the southwest of the continent hardened, its apparent existence remained a cause for concern.

   Twenty Aes Sedai sisters and three novices were killed within the Tower. Almost forty initiates, including over two dozen full sisters, were captured by the Seanchan, including the Amyrlin Seat of the White Tower herself. However, it is possible some of the captured initiates were killed when their

   The capture of Elaida and Egwene's impressive demonstration of her ability to command during the defense galvanized the Tower Aes Sedai to fully recognize and accept Egwene al'Vere as their Amyrlin Seat. This led to the end of the Aes Sedai civil conflict and the reunification of the Tower. Also, thanks to intelligence received from

   within both camps, and a third of them were captured and executed before the rest fled. While the Seanchan attack was a devastating blow to Aes Sedai morale and the White Tower's image of invulnerability, it nevertheless unified the Tower after a long period of division. With Elaida's capture, the White Tower recognized that the Seanchan would soon have the ability to Travel, thus significantly increasing the Tower's vulnerability to a Seanchan invasion.  However, such an invasion never occurred prior to the Last Battle.

   Following the Battle, the surviving Bloodknives of the Seanchan force remained in the Tower in secrecy, performing covert assassinations of sisters. Egwene and the Tower leadership mistakenly surmised these killings were being carried out by the Forsaken Mesaana who they believed was masquerading as another sister. Three Bloodknives were discovered and killed by Gawyn Trakand in a failed assassination attempt on the Amyrlin Egwene al'Vere.
