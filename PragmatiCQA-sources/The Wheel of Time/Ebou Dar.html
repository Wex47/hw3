   , but the nation that came into existence around it, Altara, only came to regard Ebou Dar as its largest city and port, not its capital. As a result, the ruling lord or lady of Ebou Dar, although styling themselves "King" or "Queen," found that their writ did not extend far from the city walls. Queen Tylin claims that no house has ruled Ebou Dar for more than two generations of rulers.

   Ebou Dar is a beautiful city with pale white buildings and plenty of canals. Transportation is easy on the passenger canal boats as well as on the broad streets and bridges. Large buildings and palaces are scattered throughout the city, the palaces richly decorated with tall spires or domes in the shapes of turnips or pears, emblazoned with bands of crimson, blue, and gold. The city is surrounded by a very thick white wall, which has three main gates—the Moldaine Gate, the Three Towers Gate, and the Dal Eira Gate—as well as several minor ones. Throughout the city, paved squares are very common, often containing a fountain bubbling water, a large statue, or both. Out of these squares, the Mol Hara square is by far the largest. At its center stands a statue of a woman with one arm raised as to point toward the sea. One entire side of the Mol Hara square is dominated by the gleaming white Tarasin palace, home of the current ruler of Altara.

   On the other side of the
   River Eldar
   lies the Rahad, the area of Ebou Dar where the less fortunate in life make their living. The streets in the Rahad are often narrow alleys, with buildings standing as high as five or six stories above the ground. The streets are filled with the refuse of the inhabitants. The Rahad is no doubt a very dangerous place. Not only are duels very frequent, some adversaries do not even bother with the formalities and simply stab their victims in the back.
