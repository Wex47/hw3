   Green
   where a natural aquifer, the
   Winespring
   , flows continuously from a low stone outcropping. The Winespring is the headwater for the
   Winespring Water
   which flows east through the Green under two low railed footbridges, the
   Wagon Bridge
   , and passes adjacent to the
   Winespring Inn
   . From there the stream widens with willow trees dotting its banks, passes the mill owned by
   Jon Thane
   , and eventually splits into several flows in the
   Waterwood
   before draining into
   The Mire
   . While some villagers reside inside the community limits, others like
   Tamlin al'Thor
   live on outlying farms.

   and waged a desperate battle for survival.
   The army of Manetheren was commanded by its king
   Aemon al Caar al Thorin
   who had failed to halt the
   Shadow
   from invading Manetheren during the
   Battle of the Tarendrelle River
   .
   His army was driven back until they were forced to wage a final desperate last stand at a field near the crossroads.  Thus began the one-day Battle of Aemon's Field where the king perished along with his army.  Legend holds that when these heroes died, a spring identical to the Winespring burst forth where they fell to forever mark their sacrifice.

   Council business typically revolves around economics and the setting of prices for wool and tabac to visiting merchants.  It is generally understood that these subjects are sensitive and not to be discussed outside council meetings.
   The council will intervene if villagers believe they have been traded with unfairly, or if local residents are in disagreement over property ownership; such as a dispute over land boundaries.
   The council will also negotiate with Councils of neighboring villages over matters jointly affecting the communities.
   In the extremely rare event that villagers or outlying farmers feel that their safety or security is at risk from outsiders, the council has been known to mobilize militias to patrol the surrounding area.
   Though elections for mayor can be contentious in the villages of the Two Rivers, Mayor al'Vere is well liked and has served multiple unopposed terms during his tenure.

   In Emond's Field the Village council is balanced by - and often at odds with - the equally important Women's Circle.  Members of the Circle are always elder females who are chosen to join the body by village agreement and include at least 2-3 women from outlying farms.
   Unlike the Council which was chartered at exactly 8 men, the size of the Circle is not set and has been known to fluctuate over time.  The village

   and keep a wary eye on visiting merchant caravans. Like all inhabitants of the Two Rivers, villagers of Emond's Field are known for a strong streak of stubbornness, a legacy of ancient Manetheren. As a consequence they are a hardy folk unwilling to give up when times are tough. While on the surface it may seem to outsiders that the conflict between the Village Council and the Women's Circle is forever ongoing, villagers are actually fiercely loyal to each other. As a result they will fight united with every fiber of their being to protect their property and way of life.

    The Annual Sheep Shear - Occurs in late spring.  The entire community will gather in a meadow east of the village next to the Winespring Water where they wash and shear sheep.
    Wool is gathered and carefully weighed and folded.  Great care is taken to make certain the right weight of wool is returned to its proper owners.  Wool gathering is an extremely labor intensive task, so the entire community assists each other and families will often prepare potluck meals to share with others.
    Younger children will be enlisted to help carry water for sheep washing and teenagers will assist with animal herding.
