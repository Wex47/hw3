   Though initially angered at her new body, she soon adapts to it. She would smile temptingly at anyone, though Egwene at least thought it was just the shape of her mouth. Formerly a womanizer, she now took pleasure in pursuing men, yet still retained her love of women, making her bisexual. She wanted any pretty man or woman she saw.

   Cabriana Mecandes
   , Aran'gar posed as a friend of Cabriana's. Her goal was to influence the rebellion and keep it going so the White Tower would remain divided and distracted. She revealed many things she supposedly learned from Cabriana about Elaida's plans; few believed her at first, but she soon gained some measure of credibility when some of Elaida's true plans leaked out, as there was some congruence. However, she was careful about what she revealed. As, Egwene, Siuan, and Leane could disprove some of her more outrageous planned claims, leading to a lessening of her overall credibility. She initially claimed that Cabriana had found evidence proving Elaida as Black Ajah, but backed off once others questioned her.
