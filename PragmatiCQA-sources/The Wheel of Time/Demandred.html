   He was described as being handsome but hook-nosed, and was tall with jet black hair. He was an exceedingly humorless individual, and those who knew him were known to remark that he never smiled. Even those who sparsely interacted with him tended to come to similar conclusions. Like virtually all of the Forsaken, he was exceedingly arrogant, and was also phenomenally petty. His sole motivation for defecting from the Light was jealousy towards Lews Therin, and he committed numerous atrocities out of sheer spite. He believed himself incapable of feeling affection, and openly treated those around him like tools to be used. Demandred was often described as being the most angry of all the Forsaken, though this wrath was tightly controlled and he rarely betrayed his calm stoic demeanor in public.

   However, before and during The Last Battle, he appeared to have a very, very slight change of disposition. He fell in love with the leader of the Sharan Ayyad, though he still prioritized killing Lews Therin above all else. His lover hoped that after his revenge on the Dragon Reborn, he could finally let go and love her. It is also revealed that Demandred, seeing no hope for defeating the Dark One, had intended to use his favor with the Dark One to protect the Sharans and all those he cared for after the Dark One's victory.

   Ilyena
   , but evidently was out-done by Lews Therin in that regard as well. Being consistently beaten by Lews Therin in virtually every aspect of his life caused Barid to become filled with petty, spiteful jealousy and bitterness, and he came to hate Lews Therin with every ounce of his being - more so even than

Demandred was the first to discover warfare in ancient scripts, before warfare was even understood. However, when Lews Therin was appointed commander of the forces of Light, Demandred was furious. Believing himself the superior general, he calculated that with Lews Therin at the command of the Light, the Shadow would triumph.

Unfortunately, Lan, having been engaged in pitched fighting all day, had been tired even before the duel began while Demandred had been relatively fresh.

   Another popular theory was that Demandred was
   Charlz Guybon
   , partially due to his physical similarities to Demandred (tall and handsome), but also because Guybon is described by Elayne as: "... his face seemed suited to smiling. He looked as if he had not smiled in too long." This, coupled with the description of Demandred as a man who "never smiles," seemed to provide a good fit. Others theorized that he could be impersonating King
