   Being Accepted is both better and worse than being a novice. Her room is larger and more comfortable, and she is trusted to channel alone and direct her own studies. However, the Accepted also has a lot more responsibility. Greater demands are made of her own studies, while at the same time she is expected to prepare and teach novice lessons on a wide range of topics. The purpose of this is to learn how to manage and control others, and she can expect to be reprimanded if she runs to the

  <p key="9f2b99ba-5403-402c-b3fd-ee6a0b365162">
   By the time she reaches Accepted, a lot of the indoctrination will have taken root. Accepted can talk at meals, but generally don't, or are very quiet. They could use the

   to do their chores, but usually won't, feeling like they've done something wrong if they do. Accepted also start to show the arrogance and haughtiness that characterize Aes Sedai. It has been theorized that the long training period is actually as much for this conditioning as it is for actual learning.

  <p key="6a5fd0ff-c748-4344-8b0f-cc6a99ba0144">
