   The purpose of all sleepweavers is to allow the user to enter the World of Dreams while sleeping. They differ by shape, material, and requirements for usage (some require channeling of Spirit, some require no channeling). Sleepweavers were apparently made during the

   were able to rescue some of them from Amico and Joya in Tear. Some time later Elayne was also able to study the objects along the one left to her by Egwene and so she learnt how to reproduce them. Elayne succeeds in making exact copies of the
   amber plaque
   and the
   iron disc
   . She makes copies of the
   twisted stone ring
   as well, but they are not exact and do not work quite as well.

  <p key="7f0bec94-21c9-43b8-bbdc-cd3066830824">
   Most of the copies and originals were left to the rebels when Elayne and Nynaeve went to Ebou Dar. Meanwhile Elayne and Nynaeve were able to rescue another sleepweaver, the silver ring, from Ispan in Ebou Dar. Finally the last known sleepweaver was rescued by Elayne from Temaile in Caemlyn after the failed attempt to kidnap her.

  <p key="bc99fb45-1fde-4298-826e-def32f994610">
   It can be guessed that either some other sleepweavers were recovered as well in Caemlyn, when many Black sisters of this group were captured, or either one or two of the stolen sleepweavers are still in the hands of the Black Ajah, because Rianna, Jeaine and Berylle were never captured.

   After Sheriam stole nineteen of the twenty sleepweavers kept in the rebels camp, Egwene asked Elayne to reproduce as many as she can from the Sleepweavers still in her custody in Caemlyn, so Elayne made many new copies from them.
