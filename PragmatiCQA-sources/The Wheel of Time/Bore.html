   Over the next hundred years the Dark One's influence in the world grew and his touch caused a degeneration in what had previously been a peaceful utopian society. With time people turned to the Shadow, openly declaring their loyal allegiance to the Dark One, and rose up against the existing order which eventually culminated in The

   . The Bore itself is described as a metaphysical point in space where the Pattern is its thinnest. It is due to this thinness that the Dark One is able to exert such control over the reality of the Bore's immediate surroundings.

   It is still unclear as to exactly what the nature of the Bore was. It is possible that the Bore was a literal hole in the Dark One's prison not large enough for him to escape completely, causing a concurrent thinness in the Pattern that could be sensed. It is also possible that the Pattern itself is the Dark One's prison, meaning the Bore was a hole in the Pattern and Rand created threads of the Pattern to seal it again.
