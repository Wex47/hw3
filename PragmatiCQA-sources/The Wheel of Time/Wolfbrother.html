   It is not possible to say, unlike in the case of channelling, that it is a genetic trait. Robert Jordan has stated that those who are wolfbrothers will be so in future rebirths as the Wheel of Time turns, but it depends on whether that Age supports the ability being able to manifest itself.
   For the duration of the Third Age, for example, the ability seems to have been largely suppressed. For this reason, even if we assume that the direct ancestors of known wolfbrothers carried such a gene, it may be possible that it would never have shown itself.

   . Neither Noam, nor his brother
   Simion
   , have any description that might indicate what age Noam's transition occurred. Based on this, it does not seem dependent on age as the onset of channeling is. We do know, however, that Perrin's eyes transform to their wolf-like yellow a day or two after he talks to wolves for the first time but that meeting Elyas seemed to have no immediate effect. Perrin's acceptance by the wolves was made easier by the fact that he had the presence of Elyas who could vouch for Perrin and introduce him to his "friends".

   classical Greek period
   .
  </p>
  <p key="2792cab2-3d6e-4e06-8f8d-90e5314c304d">
   The myths persisted through the Roman era and the Middle Ages, mainly in Germanic traditions, but in many other cultures both in Europe and elsewhere. In countries without wolves, another animal such as a hyena or tiger fulfilled a similar role.
  </p>
  <p key="eddf1b65-14e3-4a3e-aacc-f53a5b7dd690">
   Werewolves were said to have animal-like traits, even in human form, such as eyebrows that join in the middle, curved fingernails, low-set ears and a swinging stride. Perrin's tell-tale sign is his startling wolf-like eyes. In some stories, the werewolf's soul can leave his body and devour his victims, similar to the out-of-body experience of entering the Dreamworld as a wolf, if not exactly to prey on humans! Werewolves could also be subject to
   witch-trials
   and an accused could be blamed for all sorts of ill events and working in league with the Devil. The Whitecloaks, parallels of the
   Inquisition
   , similarly treat Perrin's wolfbrother ability as evidence he is linked to the Dark One.

   The Wild Man, also known as a woodwose, is a recurring figure mythical figure that appears in the artwork and literature of medieval Europe. He is usually depicted as covered in hair and armed with a long club and lives isolated among the forest and in the wilderness, far from the company of men. They are considered more animal than human in the same way as a
   satyr
   . The concept of a part-animal recluse has a bit more in common with Elyas than that of the werewolf.  Although Elyas is not covered in hair, he is clothed in animal furs, has a long and wild beard and lives an isolated life.

   Many cultures throughout the world practice or have practiced shamanic beliefs. While it is an umbrella term, some common features include the ability to divine the future, the use of a spirit guide (commonly in the form of an animal), the ability to enter and communicate with the spirit world in a quest for answers, the use of trances and the ability to leave one's body. All of these are shown in Perrin's wolfbrother abilities where

   The broader concept of wolf warriors, where warriors develop a special kinship with the animal, occurs among Indo-European, Turkish, Mongolian, and Native American cultures. While these cultures adopted the behaviour in order to bestow upon themselves some of the animal savagery in battle, Perrin is more literally possessed by the spirit of the wolf.
