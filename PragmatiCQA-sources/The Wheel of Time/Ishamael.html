   . This theory led him to realize that, due to the Wheel's cyclical nature, the Dark One would invariably receive an infinite number of chances to escape from his prison. As such, he realized that humanity would have to continually fend the Dark One off so long as the Pattern existed, and that each victory by humanity simply led to another battle. The Dark One, on the other hand, needed to win only once, as once he did, that victory would be absolute as it would be impossible for humanity to combat him once freed from his prison. He also realized that because the Dark One had a theoretically infinite number of chances to win, it became a statistical certainty that he eventually would. However, he failed to realize that every version of the battIe between the light and the shadow has already been fought throughout the ages and that the Dark One had never been able to escape his prison. In accordance with his belief that the Dark One's victory was inevitable, he became one of the first Aes Sedai in the

What is known for certain is that his soul was spun out of the Dark One's prison and into the Pattern from time to time after the prison was sealed. In fact, Ishamael may not have been initially bound at all, since he visited Lews Therin Telamon (apparently in person)

   Aran son of Malan son of Senar

His most devastating action during the Wars was when he led the Shadows forces in directly assaulting Manetheren. The attack destroyed Manetheren and allowed the Trolloc armies to ravage nearly all of the Westlands. However, Ishamael disappeared abruptly after forty years, depriving the Shadow of his leadership and allowing forces under the command of Rashima Kerenmosa to push back and ultimately defeat the Trollocs.

However, Rand received a far more grievous wound in return, as Ishamael struck him in the side with a quarterstaff,.

   </i>
   . This phase of confrontation is rather similar to this between Perrin and Sayer in AMoL 46.
   During the end of their battle, Ishamael called directly upon the Dark One to aid him, and was implied to have drawn in so much of the True Power that he could have matched even

   It was noted afterwards that his body decayed to dust almost immediately after his death, likely due to it having been ravaged by Ishamael's use of the True Power.

   . Before the War of Power, he had been a philosopher and theologian of great renown, and was noted for his extraordinarily logical demeanor and way of thinking. He was unique among the Forsaken in that he was the only member of the group who did not join for the promise of power or immortality (at least not per se), but because his logic concluded that the Dark One must inevitably win against the Dragon, and therefore the only path was to join him and rule for a time. All of the other Forsaken believed him to be insane, though some of Ishamael's statements, which were taken to be mad, were in fact simply esoteric beyond what the other Forsaken were capable of understanding (his brief talk on Chaos Theory for example). However, by the time of the Third Age, he was in fact completely mad, and may have even believed that he himself

   the Dark One at times. He was also fairly disdainful of the other Forsaken, regarding them all as fools for not understanding the nature of the Dark One, and for believing that he would hold to his promise of giving them power and immortality. As Ishamael, he appeared to desire power and recognition, both of which he achieved in spades as the Dark One's most favored disciple. This went hand in hand with a desire to demonstrate how pointless he believed fighting against the Dark One was. He also appeared, as numerous other Forsaken were, to have had a desire to prove himself greater than Lews Therin. However, his desire seemed to be at least partially rooted in his idea that he and Lews Therin were each the respective champions of the Dark and the Light, and that they were destined to always battle each other so long as the Wheel turned. He also was noted by

   as having had a sadistic streak, at least when it came to watching his rivals suffer. As Ishamael, he was once described by Sammael as having been "more than half mad, and less than half human."

   , his personality changed drastically. Though his madness was said to have been even greater as Moridin than as Ishamael, he exhibited a preternatural calm most of the time, and appeared to have left both his pride and his desire for power behind him. Additionally, he lost any hint of sadism that he had once had, and took more often than not to simply brooding in silence. Instead, he seemed fatalistically devoted to seeing the Dark One triumph, as he believed that his service to the Dark One would grant him his truest desire; to die so completely that he would never have to be reborn again. This desire was brought on by an overwhelming sense of self-loathing, and utter despair regarding what he saw as the inevitability of the Dark One's victory. This desire was apparently so strong that, rather than being punished (both for dying and for impersonating the Dark One) upon resurrection like the other re-incarnated Forsaken, the Dark One deemed that returning Ishamael to life in and of itself was punishment enough. His insanity, therefore, took on an omnicidal tone rather than a power-mad one, as the only thing he wanted was to bring about a permanent end to the world as quickly as possible. However, he did appear to suffer from violent mood swings at times, thought they were very, very transient and he tended to regain control very quickly. Several comments from

   . Indeed, the two of them, even as mortal enemies, appeared to get along oddly well during their numerous conversations in Dreamshards, and before re-integrating Lews Therin's memories with his own and recovering, Rand nearly destroyed the Pattern in a nihilistic despair similar to Ishamael's own.

   Ultimately however, despite understanding a great deal about the nature of the Pattern, he ultimately failed to realize the true nature of the Dark One, having believed that the Dark One would have allowed him the peace of oblivion despite the fact that the Dark One was completely incapable of granting peace or rest of any sort.

   . He also spent much of his leisure time in very subtly twisted Dreamshards. His favorite settings appeared to be realistic places that contained warped or impossible elements. His typical setting involved sitting alone in front of a fireplace that radiated no heat, with disturbingly human-shaped flames and clouds bursting and contorting, and burning rats behind the fireplace. Others involved places like a platform floating on endless water with people chained under the waves, perpetually drowning and being eaten by giant, unseen predators.

   Moridin was able to access the True Power, the Dark One's version of the One Power. He was capable of channeling far, far more of it than he could of the One Power, due to his position as the Dark One's favorite Forsaken, and used it to the exclusion of the One Power. This ultimately caused him numerous problems, such as increased insanity, but due to him already being insane, these effects were blunted somewhat, and though he was mad, he was still more than capable of functioning even as Ishamael. His overuse of the True Power also occasionally caused his eyes and mouth to appear as bottomless caverns of flame when his emotions spiked, though this effect ceased when he was resurrected.

   Ishamael's alias, Ba'alzamon, may be a reference to and combination of
   Beelzebub
   , one of the seven princes of Hell, and Ba'al, also one of the seven princes of Hell as well as a name given to several Demons in Christian mythology. Ba'alzamon may also be a reference to the Carthaginian supreme god Ba'al Hamon.

   As Moridin, it appears that he can hear the commands of the Dark One without being at Shayol Ghul. This may not be unique however, as it would seem that Ishamael as Ba'alzamon could communicate with the Dark One in a similar fashion; he appeared to beseech the Dark One for aid in combating

  <p key="3d01d9cd-8c63-4ddd-9ab2-7fef2e3c8d53">
   Ishamael appears to be something of a
   nihilist
   , considering his belief in the futility of mankind's struggle against the Dark One and the titles of his books. However, believing there is no hope is not the same as having no belief at all, a common misconception. A nihilist being anarchic, takes away the 'means' to any 'end'(through/from their own perspective) to them-self; namely goalless and chaos seeking.
  </p>
  <p key="96f2044d-24c7-4e4a-a32d-f2a26d8bb517">
   When channeling, Ishamael appears to use the True Power almost exclusively, despite having the maximum possible level of access to the One Power that a human can achieve unaided. He does this despite the fact that the True Power is said to drive its wielders insane after a time, and how incredibly dangerous it is to use. However, Moridin, being insane already, seems to have no difficulty in either wielding it or combatting its incredibly addictive nature.
  </p>
  <p key="b2b46306-b630-4725-88ec-c82cdbc0ba50">
   It is also noteworthy that his name, Moridin, means "death" in the Old Tongue, and given the Dark One's twisted sense of humor in naming his resurrected followers, renaming Ishamael as Moridin may have been an ironic joke on the part of the Dark One.
  </p>
  <p key="d51ec48c-f451-4586-8c80-b14396d93d25">
   Ishamael's character, philosophy and descent into madness parallels the life of Friedich Nietzsche. Ishamael's belief in a never ending battle between light and dark is similar to Nietzsche's view of eternal return where he fights Lews Therin again and again.
