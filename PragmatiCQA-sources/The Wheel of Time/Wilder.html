A way to listen in on other people's conversations, or a way of making people do as they wanted."

   . In certain cases, these women have specialized knowledge or lost Talents that exceed the skill of modern Aes Sedai, something that is only recently becoming clear. This is a surprise to both Aes Sedai and other groups of channelers in and around the westlands who generally believe Aes Sedai to be above all others in both skill and knowledge.

   Wilders are generally looked down upon by Aes Sedai and one reason is because they generally learn to do things on their own (or at least by non-Aes Sedai, which is considered just as bad), and once a weave is learned one way, learning to do it well a different way is nearly impossible. Since Aes Sedai tend to have specific methods for constructing many of their weaves, this handicap is considered a detriment. Also, many wilders tend to develop a
   block

   , and it can be extremely difficult to bypass. For example, Nynaeve al'Maera could not channel unless she was angry, which was viewed as especially strange as absolute calm is seen as necessary for one to learn channeling.
