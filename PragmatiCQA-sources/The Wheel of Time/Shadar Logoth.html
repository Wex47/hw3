   . The city and the nation fought valiantly against the forces of the Shadow but the king at the time,
   Balwen Mayel
   , was doubtful of the Light's hopes of victory and fell into despair. A mysterious man named
   Mordeth
   came to the city at some point during the war and won the king's favour, becoming his most trusted counselor. Mordeth advised that the city withdraw in on itself and that they had to become harder, become as cruel and merciless as their enemies. Corrupted by Mordeth's influence and the King's will, the people changed their battlecry to, "The victory of the Light is all," reflecting the zeal they devoted to the fight against the Shadow to the exclusion of all else, and they uttered it more frequently as their deeds became worse and worse. It soon came to be that the people had become so dark and feared that many would prefer to see the arrival of

   This descent into darkness continued, and their zeal led to people becoming mistrusting of one another, with families and friends turning on one another for unfounded suspicions. Eventually every man, woman, and child of Aridhol slew each other in a single night. In their demise, they left the vileness of their deeds behind in the very foundations of the city and Mashadar was born, an evil almost as great as the Shadow itself.
