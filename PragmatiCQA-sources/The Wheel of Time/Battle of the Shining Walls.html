   . Although the Alliance force had more than twice as many men as the Aiel, they were deployed to prevent a potential attack from any direction, and its unwieldy size prevented it from bringing overwhelming force to bear at any one point. To make matters worse, the Alliance was simultaneously forced to both defend the largest city on the continent and attempt to rout the attacking Aiel. Further complicating this was the fact that the Alliance commanders had no idea what the true objective of the Aiel forces actually was; they believed that the Aiel were attempting to overrun them and ransack Tar Valon, but the Aiel were simply there to kill Laman. As such, the Alliance's tactical concerns were completely misguided, since all the Aiel were concerned with was identifying Laman's location and killing him.
  </p>
  <p key="2bcac4c1-bdd1-4efa-8e3c-0972791551f4">
   The first two days of the battle were an indecisive bloodbath, with both sides suffering horrendous numbers of casualties. Despite their logistical and tactical issues, and the significantly greater number of casualties on their side, the Alliance commanders Lord Agelmar Jagad and Lord Captain Commander Pedron Niall managed to hold their own against the Aiel.

  <p key="93a792fe-f9cd-409b-b1b9-fc6fba218411">
   On the third day the Aiel scored a notable success by killing Lord Captain Aranvor Naldwinn, commander of the Andoran contingent, which plunged the Alliance into some confusion during the time it took them to select a replacement. During this confusion, the Aiel forces finally identified Laman's standard and made a beeline to attack him. Laman was beheaded, and his Power-wrought sword was taken as a trophy of victory. Their only objective accomplished, the Aiel then executed an extremely well-organized withdrawal over the river by night and began a rapid retreat towards the Aiel Waste. This move took the Alliance completely by surprise; neither side had achieved a decisive victory so far, and there seemed to be no tactical explanation for their withdrawal. Assuming that the Aiel had judged victory against them to be impossible, the Alliance forces mounted a pursuit as quickly as they could.

   Believing they had the Aiel on the run, the Alliance armies "drove" the Aiel south and east towards
   Kinslayer's Dagger
   . The Aiel fought several rearguard actions involving thousands of troops which succeeded in preventing the Alliance forces from catching up with the Aiel's main host. Lord Hirare Nachiman, commander of Arafel's troop detachment, was killed during one of these pointless engagements.

   In the aftermath, both sides declared victory. As the Alliance commanders believed that the Aiel had crossed the Dragonwall to lay waste to the Westlands, they believed they had shown the Aiel their mettle on the battlefield and forced them to retreat. However, it did not take long for them to realize the correlation between the timing of Laman's death and the Aiel's abrupt departure. Despite the realization that the Alliance had had nothing to do with the Aiel retreat, none of its commanders wanted to popularize that fact due to how humiliating the rest of the war had been for the Westland forces. While the popular image of a great victory over the Aiel lived on in the Westlands, many who were either involved in the battle or who were educated came to realize that all the Aiel had wanted was Laman's death, and that they had simply left once that aim was achieved.

   The Aiel declared that their objectives had been fulfilled and vengeance had been satisfied, but they did not seem to take great pleasure in the carnage they had unleashed. Janduin, in particular, was heartbroken as his pregnant lover,

Though he was told by his astounded peers that he could not do such a thing, he simply walked away and traveled to the Blight, where he hoped to lose his life fighting against the ever-present forces of the Shadow.
