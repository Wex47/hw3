Many of those who she interacted with, including virtually all of the other Forsaken, have expressed the sentiment that she had a vastly overinflated opinion of herself. She was proud, arrogant, presumptuous, and self-absorbed, actively betraying both her allies and her master in order to gain more power for herself. She appears to have had a particularly strong rivalry with

She was also extremely manipulative, and had absolutely no qualms about lying to, or using, virtually anyone to get what she wanted. Additionally, she appeared to have no loyalties except to herself.

   ), has appeared, and has been confirmed by some other Forsaken to be Lanfear reincarnated. Cyndane, however, claimed she had lost the right to call herself Chosen and that the Dark One is tormenting her, which, along with Moridin commenting on the one that is suffering more than all others (This is presumed to be the reincarnated Lanfear), indicate that she is nothing more than an ordinary shadow lord at the beginning of the Last Battle, even if an exceptionally powerful one. It is notable that she is being reincarnated even though she betrayed the Dark One in virtually every possible way. Moghedien's thoughts hint that more Forsaken have died because of the Dark One's distrust than through the hands of the fighters for the light. Indeed, Verin claims in her last conversation with Egwene that betraying the Dark One is supposed to be impossible even though betrayal itself is not necessarily evil since "egoism must be preserved".

   After rebuffing several of her attempts at  tricking or seducing him into freeing her from the Dark One's torments, Rand gives Lanfear one last chance at redemption. He tells her that if she will open her mind completely to him, so that she can hide nothing of her plans and schemes to him, he will free her if he sees nothing evil there. She refuses to allow herself to be so vulnerable, even with him. In response, he opens his mind to her and allows her to see that she no longer has any hold on him and that he never loved her. After this, she truly does give up on wooing Lews Therin back to her, and her hatred of him is fierce.

Her plan is to strike while the Dark One is helpless, thereby saving him and making herself the highest and most powerful of the Chosen.

   Perrin is able to see himself as both man and wolf, and because of this duality he is able to remember his love for Faile, and his duty to do what Rand cannot. Breaking through the power of Lanfear's Compulsion, he reaches out and breaks her neck, ending her scheming and manipulations.
