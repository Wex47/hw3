   It is known that many other people have visited the Aelfinns, although in a very remote past. According to an interview with Brandon Sanderson, counselor Mordeth was one of them. Also coming to the world of the Aelfinns and the Eelfinns in one of their past lives were the heroes Gaidal Cain and Birgitte Silverbow, but they did not return alive and died after wandering two months lost by the labyrinthine runners. It is also known that Lanfear and Moridin have been in this world in recent times, but it is unknown if both came to ask the three questions.

   There seems to exist some form of a hierarchy among them: when the first Eelfinn approaches Mat, Noal, and Thom, it claims it can bring them where they want to go.

   The Finn appear to be bound by an ancient treaty between themselves and the humans of the real world.

   The game is played on a board marked with a web-like playing area, with arrows denoting movement around the web; some paths are one-way, others are omnidirectional. Ten pale wooden discs marked with a wavy line denote the Snake pieces, similarly ten discs marked with a triangle denote the Foxes; these twenty pieces are stacked at the corners of the board. Two black discs representing the human players are placed at the center of the web, and the aim of the game is to move the human pieces to the edge of the web and back without being touched by any of the snake or fox pieces. Dice rolls direct the movement of the pieces.
  </p>
  <p key="f5c13c43-524b-4733-94af-53e09efb2091">
   The game begins by enacting a symbol, a triangle with a wavy line drawn through it, and intoning the rhyme: "Courage to strengthen, fire to blind, music to dazzle, iron to bind." The player then rolls dice for both his own pieces and those of the enemy, in sequence. Player pieces are moved to keep as much distance from the snakes and foxes as possible, while following the rules of movement marked on the web. The enemy pieces are moved towards the human pieces in as direct a manner as possible. If a snake or a fox touches a human piece, the piece is removed; when both are removed, the game is lost. The rules ensure that "most of the time [a player] did not make it as far as the outer edge," let alone back to the center.

   The dimension that these creatures live in has very strange laws of physics. Things like weight and stress on buildings do not seem to matter as much, judging by the way that structures are built.

   The constructs of the Aelfinn's world consist of curves and spirals; in contrast the constructs of the Eelfinn's world consist of sharp, straight lines and angles. Given the web-like play area of the Snakes and Foxes game, and the notion that both the Aelfinn and Eelfinn share the same and yet separate dimensions, it can be speculated that the Finn's dimension resembles a web in more than name; the Aelfinn inhabiting the curving spirals, and the Eelfinn inhabiting the spokes.
   Additionally, pathways through their realm appear to be governed by laws of physics so different from those of the human world as to appear completely random. For instance, in order to proceed

   The Finn resemble fairies, both in their weakness towards iron, and in having two distinct realms--similar to the Seelie and Unseelie courts of the fairies in Scottish folklore. Also like fairies, they are not considered evil, and can be useful, but are not considered strictly good either.

   Finn have a similarity to kitsune, foxlike creatures in Japanese mythology. Kitsune are credited with magical powers such as divination, fortelling and the ability to weave vast illusions.

   Mat, Thom and Noal's journey through their realm has many similarities to navigating a maze in an
   interactive fiction
   (text adventure) game. Such games often have a maze of rooms with identical descriptions and exits that are not
   simply connected
   (e.g.: going north and then south will not necessarily take you back to the same room.) The description of Noal's attempts to make a map is similar to the manner a player of a text adventure would do so, and is similarly thwarted.
