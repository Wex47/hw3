   The Da'shain Aiel led by Adan is attacked again by barbaric people. Many of the Aiel are killed. The attackers take their horses, throw down the Aes Sedai objects the Aiel carry and fill the wagons with women and daughters. Adan holds his grandson and granddaughter safe in a sandy hollow, crying. He has lost his wife and his last son. Only left with his grandchildren. His last daughter,
   Rhea
   , is shoved up into one of the wagons like an animal. Adan thinks about how he lost
   Elwin

   Jaren
   , who threw himself off a cliff a year ago at the age of nineteen when he found he could channel, and

But it made no difference to the raiders. Adan replies: they bury their dead and go on. When Sulwin points out that without horses and wagons the can't just go on, also questioning the value of the objects of Aes Sedai, who will never come to take them back but they supposed to give their lives to protect them, Adan shouts:
