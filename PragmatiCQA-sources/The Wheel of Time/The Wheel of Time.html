   Over the next three and a half thousand years, the human race returns to a level of technology roughly comparable to that of the Middle Ages, with the difference that women enjoy full equality with men in most societies, and are superior in some. This is put down to the power and influence of the female-only Aes Sedai spilling over into everyday life. Several major wars have ravaged the main continent since the defeat of the Dark One, such as the

   From then on, the story expands and the original characters are frequently split into different groups, pursuing different missions or agendas aimed at furthering the cause of the Dragon Reborn, sometimes thousands of miles apart. Broadly speaking, the original group of characters from the Two Rivers make new allies, gain experience, and become figures of some influence and authority. As they struggle to unite the western kingdoms against the Dark One's forces, their task is complicated by rulers of the nations who refuse to give up their authority and by factions such as the

   , the people of a long-lost colony of Artur Hawkwing's empire across the western ocean who have returned, believing it is their destiny to conquer the world. The Aes Sedai also become divided between those who believe the Dragon Reborn should be strictly controlled, and those who believe he must lead them into battle as he did in the earlier war. As the story expands, new characters representing different factions are introduced; although this expansion of the narrative allows the sheer scale of the growing struggle to be effectively depicted, it has been criticized for slowing the pace of the novels and sometimes reducing the appearances of the original or main cast to extended cameos.

  <p key="6dfca79b-8942-4bf6-bcef-800353dff9df">
   In the early 1980s Robert Jordan wrote several
   <i key="7a931a96-063b-4eff-ada5-5e81e2a8e6e5">
    Conan the Barbarian
   </i>
   novels for Tor Books, including a novelization of the movie
   <i key="bc837cc4-7583-4cdc-8166-4a98977cdbe4">
    Conan the Destroyer
   </i>
   . These proved successful and in 1984 he proposed an idea for an epic fantasy series of six books to Tom Doherty, the head of Tor Books. Doherty approved the idea and Jordan began writing the novel that became
   <i key="61944dad-81b9-41e7-909a-045abe871e4a">
    The Eye of the World
   </i>
   .
  </p>
  <p key="c6a2482c-e4ab-4030-9f45-55401fd8b1b0">
   The novel proved extremely difficult to write and characters and storylines changed considerably during the writing process. The series was originally centered on an older man who discovered relatively late in life that he was the 'chosen one' who had to save the world. However, Jordan deliberately decided to move closer to the tone and style of JRR Tolkien's
   <i key="a8a6f3b4-8622-48fa-a45f-7990985bc1d6">
    The Fellowship of the Ring
   </i>
   and made the characters younger and less experienced. Once this decision had been made, writing proceeded much more easily and Jordan completed the second volume,
   <i key="bb30569c-b705-42cd-939b-3530ffdbe465">
    The Great Hunt
   </i>
   , at roughly the same time the first book was published.

  <p key="cea82978-6729-4ea3-b2d5-59589875d4cb">
   Tom Doherty enjoyed
   <i key="16906a8f-3d2d-4bac-9ccc-86be7c5dde6b">
    The Eye of the World
   </i>
   so much that he declared it would be the biggest fantasy series since Tolkien, and took the unprecedented steps of sending free review copies to every bookstore in the United States to generate interest. The combined hardcover and trade paperback run of the novel sold out of its initial 40,000-strong print run. Sales then doubled with the publication of the second novel just eight months later generating more interest in the first book.
  </p>
  <p key="ba3b2eb1-a32c-40bc-b82b-145a424f8892">
   The series draws on elements of numerous mythologies, including Norse, Celtic, and Asian legends (particularly Japanese and Indian sources). The recursive nature of time and the nature of reincarnation are drawn from Buddhism, while the notions of balance, duality, and a respect for nature are drawn from Taoism. Jordan has cited several other novels as inspiration, such as
   <i key="5d547241-0c3e-4751-82d0-18da5c87731f">
    The Lord of the Rings
   </i>
   and particularly
   <i key="61990ced-76fc-4bc0-980e-b3aa3c069a70">
    War and Peace
   </i>
   . Jordan himself stated that one of the biggest themes of the series is the mutability of knowledge: that in a pre-technological civilization eyewitness reports are exaggerated and changed in the telling until they bear little resemblance to the original events. The relationship between men and women is also a key theme of the series.
  </p>
  <p key="9d0a6afb-7051-4a67-9911-58d72ef0a426">
   Jordan wrote full-time at breakneck speed for the next several years until he completed the seventh volume,
   <i key="6a49a5eb-773d-4c75-9a87-bcfd0dc399a4">
    A Crown of Swords
   </i>
   in early 1996, at which point he slowed down, delivering a book every two years. Fans objected when he took some time off to expand a short story into a prequel novel called
   <i key="d8e903c3-eb21-458d-8765-fd2d55d062a4">
    New Spring
   </i>
   , so he decided to shelve his plans for additional prequels in favor of finishing off the series. He rejected criticisms of the later volumes of the series slowing down in pace in order to concentrate on minor secondary characters at the expense of the main characters from the opening volumes, but acknowledged that his structure for the tenth volume,
   <i key="779a4cab-2840-4404-ab5b-fd8cdbee7255">
    Crossroads of Twilight
   </i>
   , had not worked out as he'd planned.

   , the eleventh volume, had a much more positive reception from critics and fans alike and Jordan announced the twelfth volume, which he'd previously announced would have the working title
   <i key="0b167253-9852-4894-90d0-561becabce43">

  </h2>
  <p key="2c3b8b53-b081-4564-97c4-88d9e131d570">
   Jordan had repeatedly said that the main sequence would conclude with the twelfth book, with a working title of
   <i key="1ff3233f-eebd-4b65-aee1-00066b922343">

    </a>
   </i>
   . Numerous times, including most recently at ComicCon 2006, he said he would hold to this statement even if it had to be 1500 pages long. Before his death Jordan had planned to write two more short prequel novels, an encyclopedia, and possibly two or three other side-plot novels.
   Aware that he might not live to complete the series, Jordan prepared notes so that the series could be finished the way he wanted it to be.
  </p>
  <p key="ac1059fc-4122-4cea-b7b4-4f08eb55ab35">
   With Jordan's death on September 16, 2007, the conclusion of the series was in question. On December 7 of that year, the publisher, Tor Books, announced that fantasy author

  </p>
  <p key="ab88b792-9450-4ec1-a6b4-95a69b8370fc">
   Sanderson said on his website in March of 2008 that he had begun writing the final book in the series.
   He also stated that he wants to finish the series in the final book as planned, but later acknowledged that the book may be up to half again his originally-planned length, and publishing in one volume may not be practical.
