   The name Graendal may be an allusion to Grendel, one of the three antagonists in the epic poem Beowulf, along with Grendel's mother and the dragon. The Grendel from Beowulf is, however, a male monster/fighter and bears no resemblance to the Graendal of WoT; rather it is Grendel's mother who's been repeatedly portrayed in film as a shape-shifting seductress more fitting with Graendal's description. An argument could be made that Graendal is, nonetheless, still a monster whose name is used to scare children and Jordan conflated the two characters into a single persona.

   The eventuality that people will see this as a family line, that males are predominantly seen as more dangerous and beastly than women and that the Mother appearance of Graendal to the child of Hessalam is very likely, which would lead people to take the story of the monstrous evil of Graendal that the people of the Third Age knew as a woman and transpose that to the ugly monster of Hessalam, who then through generations is recontextualised as a male (due to propensity that males are seen as being more dangerous) can have the name forgotten as Hessalam is unknown to people and Graendal is, which through simplification leads to Graendal-(Hessalam) Graendal's Mother-(Graendal) and the Dragon-(Rand) being defeated by the heroic legend based on Perrin-(who is the misunderstood "hero" of the legend through generational decay of the stories, with people mixing in that he defeated two enemies and protected Rand with who eventually defeats Graendal).
