   In the Age of Legends, material wealth had come to mean virtually nothing, as the means existed by which virtually anyone could acquire it. Instead, an individual gained social stature, respect, and high office by means of their service to humankind. Everyone was born with two names, but a citizen could gain a third name as an honorific as a recognition of public service. This service could take the form of virtually anything so long as it benefited the human race in some way. Great historians, scientists, researchers, healers, humanitarians, philosophers, engineers; all could acquire a third name if their work merited it. Theoretically, nobody was unhappy, and all were provided for.

   Channelers in the Age of Legends had to work as hard for this recognition as any, and channeling was rarely seen as an advantage in earning the respect and gratitude of a community. However, the name Aes Sedai, literally meaning Servants of All, was chosen to signify how the channelers only wanted to help the world community.

   However, all was not as it seemed. According to Rand al'Thor/Lews Therin, despite the society's apparently utopian state, there were still social problems festering beneath civilization's veneer that the world's government did not want to acknowledge. In hindsight, he believed that, had the

   Not much survives in the way of records of the world governments. There were global parliaments and councils that somehow interacted with one another to come to decisions. It is uncertain how much area or population these bodies presided over, although it is thought to be substantial. The effectiveness of the global government, however, seems questionable. According to Rand al'Thor/Lews Therin, the individuals responsible for governing were apparently ignoring a considerable number of social problems, and may have even been in denial that such problems existed at all.

They could run for government positions, but being a channeler was not a prerequisite, nor was it of any aid with regard to actually obtaining said positions. However, channelers typically excelled at their professions due to the options the One Power afforded them, and as a group they were afforded much respect for their achievements. Since they comprised only three percent of the population, there were truly not as many as usually perceived (although since the average life span of an Aes Sedai not bound by an Oath Rod is around ten times as long a non-channeler, depending on their strength, quite a few channelers could have been alive at one time, even though only three out of every one hundred were born with the ability). Due to their extensive knowledge, the truly powerful could perform what seemed like miracles, often through the use of a

People by the Third Age often believe that the Aes Sedai could become invisible (Rand al’thor is taught this by Asmodean) and traveled by flying (which was confirmed by Rand al'Thor with Lews Therin’s memories). Not all Aes Sedai worked in the use of the One Power; many chose not to, or simply used the One Power to augment their ability to perform their chosen profession.
