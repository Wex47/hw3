   . Aemon had always come to the aid of allies under attack and his final victory occurred circa
   1200 AB
   at a place known as the
   Field of Bekkar
   . However, the battle at Bekkar was a ruse premeditated by forces of the
   Shadow
   intended to overextend the Army of Manetheren so that a direct assault upon the Manetheren heartland could be achieved. Aemon marched his army back to his homeland and engaged the shadow in a titanic multiple-day struggle that came to be known as the
   Battle of the Tarendrelle River
   . Ultimately the shadow overran Manetheren and the nation was destroyed.

   following the wars descendants of Manetheren slowly began to return to the Two Rivers area to begin farming the still-fertile land. In time new communities were established amidst the ruins of the once-great nation and the inhabitants began to forget their heritage though they retained a fierce streak of independence. The town of Taren Ferry was founded to provide access to the area and its ferry replaced older Manetheren infrastructure that had previously crumbled and washed away. Watch Hill was established on a dome shaped hill that had once served as a military outpost. Deven Ride was built upon the ruins of an older Manetheren town that had existed near a bridge over the White River that had also become a ruin destined to wash away in time. Emond's Field was initially established as "Aemon's Field" and built on the site where King Aemon fell to overwhelming forces after retreating from the Tarendrelle River. The
   Winespring
   in Emond's Field is said to have burst forth on the day of that final battle, and marks the final heroic sacrifice of the last soldiers of Manetheren.

   the nation of Andor extended its influence into the Two Rivers district in order to access extractable wealth from the Mountains of Mist. In time Andor would come to focus the majority of its attention upon the mining community of Baerlon and the Two Rivers district became mostly forgotten.

   The region's long separation from the broader world has promoted closely knit communities and tightly controlled bloodlines.  As a result, a historic genetic link to the people of Manetheren has been largely preserved in the area.  Moreover, the difficulty of accessing the Two Rivers poses a barrier for those actively searching for channelers.  Historically few

   Inhabitants of the Two Rivers typically live a lifestyle centered around farming and tradecraft. Adult women wear their hair in a
   braid
   and a young girl from the Two Rivers is allowed to braid her hair only when the local Women's Circle determines that she is of marriageable age. Men are usually farmers or masters of a trade skill. Every spring the people in the three lower villages hold a

   festival on their village greens where contests are held and unmarried adult villagers are encouraged to dance together around a
   Spring Pole
   . Villagers typically marry in their late teens or early twenties. A young woman who is interested in a young man may attempt to show her interest by placing flowers in his hair during Bel Tine or embroidering a feastday shirt for him any time.
   Two Rivers folk can also be distrustful of outsiders, evidenced when they occasionally refer to Taren Ferry men as "sheepstealers"
   or by keeping wary eyes on visiting merchant caravans. All inhabitants of the Two Rivers are known for a strong streak of stubbornness, a legacy of ancient Manetheren. As a consequence they are a hardy folk unwilling to give up even when times are tough. While on the surface it may seem to outsiders that the conflict between Village Councils and Women's Circles is forever ongoing, villagers are actually fiercely loyal to each other. As a result they will fight united with every fiber of their being to protect their property and way of life.
