   set forth in white, which hangs in the center of a sister's back when the shawl is worn. The shawl is worn around the shoulders of an Aes Sedai, or looped over her arms. The shawl is also described as being embroidered with grapevines

   , the shawls were rarely worn except on formal occasions. A sister dressed formally would be expected to wear her shawl along with a dress in her Ajah colors.

   In the wake of later events in the White Tower, with its openly hostile relations between the Ajahs, the Aes Sedai still in Tar Valon wear their shawls whenever they are in mixed groups as a blatant demonstration of their Ajah loyalties, as well as a bit of almost jingoistic pride.
