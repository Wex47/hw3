   In reality, the loss may have been because of the geographic turmoil caused by the rampant violence of mad male channelers, something so pervasive that no permanent settlements from the Age of Legends survived the cataclysm. It may also have been because any channeler who remembered the wonders of the Age of Legends was dead before the end of the Breaking and were unable to pass on even a once-commonplace Weave such as Travelling.

   Like many Weaves, a minimum level of strength is required for it to work. A woman who is too weak to Travel can still form the weave, if not make it "active". This is evident when Cadsuane learns it from Sorilea. The exact level of strength needed to successfully make a Gateway is not known.  Mesaana tells Alviarin her strength is "not much, but enough", but this does not give us a very accurate measurement other than Alviarin's strength of 17(5) is above that needed to Travel.

   This fact presents itself in the size of Gateway a person can make relative to their strength in the One Power or, for weaker channelers,  if they can make the Weave work at all.

   </a>
   shows one extreme of this Talent. His weakness in the One Power makes it surprising that his Gateways are functional at all. Not only do they work, he can weave gateways many times larger and much more deftly than anyone channeler except perhaps Rand al'Thor. Similarly,
   Berisha Terakuni
   is able to weave a Gateway large enough for Faile to pass through riding atop a wagon, whereas Elayne cannot weave one tall enough for Mat to pass through while mounted, despite Elayne being significantly stronger.

   It may be assumed that the average strength needed to weave a gateway is 22(10). Kinswoman
   Sabeine Ocalin
   , at level 21(9), is significantly weaker than Alviarin, but can weave a Gateway unaided. This is also true of Ashamanaille at level 22(10). In contrast,
   Merilille Ceandevin
   finds it a source of shame that she must depend on
   Reanne Corly
   to weave a Gateway for her, despite Merilille being the same strength as Ashmanaille.
   Sibella
   , another Kinswoman, is also at level 22(10) and unable to Travel.

   The main way Aes Sedai can get around not being strong enough to Travel is to link with another woman. Note that this option is not available to the Seanchan as they do not know how to create circles. Usually a pair of linked Aes Sedai each with an average strength can  provide enough power to open a suitable gateway. In
   Towers of Midnight
   , four weak
   Kinswomen
   (such as
   Alise
   at strength level of 46(34) link to make a gateway of a similar size to those of a linked pair of average-strength Aes Sedai.

   Gateways can be used as a weapon is a couple of different ways. Firstly, by deliberately creating the Gateway to slice into the victim (as

   Deathgates
   - rapidly opening and closing horizontal Gateways which spin and move over an area. All Shadowspawn except

   die when they pass through a Gateway.

  <p key="6343860e-2da2-4896-bc25-6e3e0facc4e7">
   For instance a very talented but weak as Androl can open gateways in few seconds, in vertical and horizontal position, large and short, without the need to "learn" for a while the starting point. All with a precision at the millimeter (he has showed that can cut and shape a piece of leather in his hands, using little gateways. Or open a great horizontal gateway on the floor of a room so all the people in that area fall into it). On the contrary the not very talented people, even if very strong, have difficulties to open a Gateway where it is needed, they have difficulties to locate the starting point (needing more time to "learn" it) and difficulties to open the gateway in the right position of the arriving point.

   The weave holding the gateway open can then be tied off temporarily, after which the portal can be used by anybody in the area until it dissipates. If the weaves are left to dissipate, the gateway will shrink back to a single vertical light line and eventually disappear. Using the One Power, it is possible, though difficult, to stop this process after it has started.

   As was described above it is very important to first memorize/"learn" the location from where you wish to open a gateway and to quicken this process a channeler can hold the source for a while.

   It is later revealed there is a trick to elude the need to know very well the starting point of Traveling: in fact a channeler can create a gateway traveling to a very short distance (within eye sight, for instance) without needing to know an area. Then, once he has opened that gateway, he automatically "learns" the area well enough to make a second new gateway to go anywhere.

   Skimming
   ).
