   Shiota was famed for its feather-dancers, which were common enough for it to be an idiom: "as easy as finding feather-dancers in Shiota".
   It is, perhaps, from this tradition that the
   Festival of Birds
   has its origin.

   Shiota may have had a matriarchy. All known references to the rulers of Shiota in the series mention the Shiotan warrior Queens. The toes of what remained of a two-hundred foot tall once-great warrior Queen is used by
   Careane Fransi

   Bashere observes that another statue in western Illian was of a Shiotan Queen. A statue with a sword signifies that she was a conqueror and the crown she wore meant that she expanded the borders. Although a different statue, it is possible that it may be of the same woman. If a matriarchy, it would explain the legacy of female dominance of many trades and the use of the marriage knife extant in Ebou Dar. Bashere makes an observation that the crown the statue wears is reminiscent of the
   Crown of Swords
   , the crown of Illian which was once part of that nation.
   He also reflects that she may have been seen as the hope of Shiota in her day, as famous as Artur Hawkwing would be, and now not even the sisters of the

   As with many of the nations of the Free Years, little is known of Shiota's history. The kingdom arose out of the ruins of Eharon with the rebuilding of the capital as Ebou Dar a top priority during its earlier history. The nation appears to have had a possibly martial history, with large statues dating from the time of Shiota showing the rulers wearing crowns made of swords.

   the rulers of Ebou Dar managed to establish control over much of the former territory of Shiota, naming it Altara, but were never able to decisively forge a unified kingdom. Instead, Altara became a patchwork of semi-autonomous fiefdoms paying lip service, if that, to the ruler in Ebou Dar.
