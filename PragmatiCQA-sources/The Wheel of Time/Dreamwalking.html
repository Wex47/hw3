   Bair
   also says the Tower "has not produced a dreamwalker in nearly five hundred years".
   This would doubtless be Corianin. Regarding Verin's mislabelling, the Wheel of Time Companion notes that Aes Sedai occasionally (although rarely) refer to Dreamwalking as Dreaming.
   On the other hand, Corianin was in possession of a
