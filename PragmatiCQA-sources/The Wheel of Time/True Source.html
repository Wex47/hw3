     "The One Power comes from the True Source, the driving force of creation, the force the Creator made to turn the Wheel of Time. Saidin, the male half of the True Source, and saidar, the female half, work against each other, and at the same time together to provide that force. Saidin is fouled by the touch of the Dark One, like water with a thin slick of rancid oil floating on top. The water is still pure, but it cannot be touched without touching the foulness. Only saidar is still safe to be used...
     The True Source cannot be used up, any more than the river can be used up by the wheel of the mill. The Source is the river; the Aes Sedai, the waterwheel."

   It can be seen as a source, quite literally, of energy capable of manipulating the universe, which prolongs the lives of its users by a factor of ten or even more, depending on individual strength. It is never used up by someone channeling it, only woven into a purpose temporarily. Each half of the One Power can be used only by people of the associated sex.
  </p>
  <p key="33af9cc0-daa9-4b43-8d1a-b1d6a5ee2adc">
   The two halves are direct opposites, yet both complement each other, by turning the

   through both cooperation and opposition. The essential differences in the nature of the two halves of the Power mean that a woman cannot teach a man to channel, and vice versa.

  <p key="dc23bc7a-8579-4ea8-a376-81cea1d2e49b">
   Not everyone has the ability to "channel," or access, the One Power. Most have none at all, and some only have the ability to be taught, to one degree or another. But a few channelers are born with "the
   <a href="Spark.html" key="1fd3db35-04a9-4d88-98e1-cd29b05c8d4b" title="Spark">
    spark
   </a>
   ," an innate inclination that will lead them to touch the Source whether they wish to or not. These untrained channelers, sometimes referred to as
   <a href="Wilder.html" key="0b6755f1-ea44-4431-83c9-3d67acbf9075" title="Wilder">
    wilders
   </a>
   often die without ever gaining control over their innate ability by a
   strange sickness
   ; some research indicates the mortality rate for untrained channelers is 75% or more. Often, however, the survival comes with a price; wilders may not even know they are using the One Power to do things. They just know that sometimes, "things happen" when they want them badly enough.
  </p>
  <p key="60d43e1a-d070-44b5-8094-4302627a32ec">
   Wilders are also frequently saddled with a
   block
   , an instinctive self-preservation instinct that causes them trouble when they do try to channel purposefully. For example, these blocks can take the form of only being able to channel while angry, or only with one's eyes closed. Those who do not have the spark can go their entire lives without touching the Power, or even realizing they can. Within a short period of time after wilders first channel without training, they will suffer side effects, of which there are many, such as fever and chills, or taking uncharacteristic risks. These side effects will bring the untrained channeler increasingly closer to an incident of touching the Power, until they coincide. At this moment, without the proper training, the channeler will most likely die soon "as though an invisible clock had begun ticking."
  </p>
  <p key="da5e8d76-c191-499f-a1a8-940442e805f8">
   Channelers are not born equal; some are stronger in the Power and can handle more of it than others. Men and women who can channel are different in this respect and in many others, regarding the One Power. For example, male channelers can on average channel more of the Power than female channelers, similar to the gendered difference in physical strength.
  </p>
  <p key="d22fe26b-0f44-4676-b3de-20a434fb43ec">
   Channelers must always be careful, as the One Power is dangerous. Besides providing an addictive stimulating effect, channelers who draw too much of the Power into themselves can kill themselves or render themselves brain-dead. If they are lucky--relatively speaking--they will only burn the ability to channel out of themselves, leaving them unable to channel ever again.
  </p>
  <p key="587c8b4b-4acb-4b5c-ae49-9230db7df823">
   Channelers can also be permanently denied the Source by another party. In modern

   independently discovered how to heal severing, but the process is imperfect, experimental, and still in development. While either gender can heal severing, there is evidence that healing severing is more effective when it's performed by a channeler of the gender opposite of the former channeler. Those who are restored by a channeler of their own gender have found their strength in the Power reduced around 1/3 from their strength they had before being severed.

   Both men and women with the spark come to a point of crisis in which they are in severe mortal danger, assuming they've had no training. The One Power is extremely dangerous to the untrained. Many women who die under mysterious circumstances in their late teenage years are actually wilders who have failed to cope with their abilities. The women who survive invariably develop mental blocks that prevent channeling in the absence of certain conditions; two known blocks required severe anger or thoughts about men before their sufferers could allow themselves to channel. Another is the ability to channel only with one's eyes shut, which can be inconvenient, because a channeler must be able to see flows in order to weave them. Serious and sometimes drastic counseling is often required to overcome blocking.

    in the training to learn the very complex weaves required for passing the test for the shawl, medium-high ranking Aes Sedai usually take a dozen years (6+6), average Aes Sedai twenty years (10+10), while the weakest Aes Sedai, such as

    Usually, the strongest channelers, having more ability and proficiency in making weaves, are more skilled in all uses of the One Power, so they also have a propensity for studying and experimenting with it, are more intuitive with its use, and are able to invent new weaves or rediscover those that were considered "lost".

   , which differs to the main books of the WoT in many points, overall strength in the One Power was only a measure of the sheer raw amount of the One Power that an individual could draw at once, which also determined whether or not that individual could create certain weaves. When two channelers compared their strength, this was the factor that was considered. The scale of strength in the One Power consisted of 72 base levels, with 72 being the lowest end of the range, and 1 being the highest. In addition, there were six more levels for men at the high end, ++6 to ++1.

   . Of note, despite the disparity in maximum strength between the genders, it was possible for a woman at 1(+12) to be a roughly equal match for a man at ++1, as women possessed a greater innate dexterity with weaving than men. However, this relative lack of dexterity could be overcome through practice.

   Confirmation of the Taint being cleansed comes in two forms. Firstly in the fact that Lews Therin states that the Source is "Pure and Clean" again, him being the only man (aside from the Forsaken) that knew the source before it was fouled by the taint. Secondly, conversations between the Forsaken posits that the male among them, may no longer be trustworthy after the cleansing - that is, the female Forsaken turned to the Dark One of their free will, whereas the male Forsaken had to remain with the Shadow due to the protection from the taint that the Dark One provided.
