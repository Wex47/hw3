The oceans fled, and the mountains were swallowed up, and the nations were scattered to the eight corners of the World. The moon was as blood, and the sun was as ashes.

   What Elan Morin Tedronai says in the Prologue of TEOTW indicates that Lews Therin Telamon only earned the name Dragon during the War of Power, so as Elan Morin Tedronai was named Betrayer of Hope. Lews Therin Telamon was never mentioned to be named Dragon Reborn.

   In addition, the serpent kind creature with four legs being displayed on the banner of Lews Therin Telamon in the War of Shadow was also called dragon. The origin of the creature – whether it ever existed or was simply a legendary beast that the Dragon was named after – is unknown.

There are also villages or lands where even talking about the Prophecies is forbidden or avoided. E.g. Emond's Field. That's why Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene and Nynaeve know nothing about the Karaethon Cycle and cannot put pieces together, cannot recognise events happening around them until they learn about the Prophecies.
