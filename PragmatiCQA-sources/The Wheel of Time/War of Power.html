However, the society of the time had advanced to the point that females and males each being able to draw strictly from a single half of the One Power had become an impediment to further progress.

   The War of Power began when enough people had declared themselves for the Shadow to amass armies. These armies, primarily composed of humans, began an assault on the decaying utopian civilization that the rest of humanity comprised. At this time, the concept of war was unfamiliar to those among humanity who had not been corrupted, so the forces of the Dark initially achieved quick gains before a war of attrition began. Aes Sedai, due to their ability to wield the One Power and as important academic and civic figures, frequently became the leaders of the forces of the Light.

   At first the Shadow advanced rapidly against an unprepared populace, taking vast swathes of territory and a large number of cities. To make matters worse, a number of prominent and exceptionally powerful Aes Sedai began to defect to the Shadow for various reasons, becoming the "Chosen" or, as humanity dubbed them, the "Forsaken". The very first of these defectors was Mierin Eronaile, one of the researchers who first drilled the

   Eventually, the Forces of the Light managed to sufficiently organize and began their first counter-stroke. The governing body of the Aes Sedai at the time, the Hall of Servants, took control of the Light's war effort and human society as a whole.

   , the highest ranking, most powerful, and most esteemed member of the Hall was, at least ostensibly, placed in overall command of the Light's armies. They pushed the Dark One's forces back heavily, retaking most of what had been initially lost. But during that time they discovered the terrible atrocities the armies of the Shadow had committed both when taking the cities, and later under the administration of the Dark One's followers. Cities retaken were little more than blackened wastelands, where people refusing to swear for the Dark One had been burnt alive at the corners. Retaking these cities became grim, horrific experiences which ultimately ended up consuming significant resources as the forces of the Light attempted to make these cities habitable again. With the drain on the Light's resources, the Shadow's armies, augmented by ever increasing numbers of Shadowspawn, again took the offensive and gradually began to push back the Forces of the Light as betrayals, low morale, and the Shadow's ability to manufacture soldiers wore humanity down. Additionally, the forces of the Light had to contend with a number of organizations that wished to sue for peace with the Forsaken. While a few of these groups looked at first to perhaps be succeeding, it was later discovered that virtually every single one of these organizations had been aiding the Shadow in some way, often unwittingly.
  </p>
  <p key="584cee2c-7cab-42c9-ae98-3eaa8e9681d2">
   Eventually, the Forces of the Light began to succumb, due in no small part to the fact that the Shadow was willing to murder much of the population of conquered territories while the Light had to continue feeding and supplying their own civilization. Their resources thinning, the Forces of the Light could no longer sustain a protracted war, and were moving rapidly towards defeat.

  <p key="3a84cba9-4c74-4812-b248-df5e44e4e95a">
   However, according to Rand al'Thor after acquiring the memories of his past self, perhaps the primary reason for the Light's poor performance in the later stages of the war was the fact that there seemed to be little in the way of a formal chain of command for their armies. Though Lews Therin was at some point in the war appointed officially as the Supreme Commander of the Light's forces, so many amongst the commanders believed themselves above their compatriots that Rand described the situation as akin to having "an army of generals". He indicated that this caused a great deal of disorder amongst the Light's forces, and considerably blunted the effectiveness of the Light's military efforts.

   would be required to shield the wielder from harm. However, some members of the Hall opposed this plan, citing that creating such weapons, or trusting anyone to wield that much Power, was too dangerous. Additionally, they pointed out that the Bore had expanded since it had been drilled, and that implementing this plan would simply allow the Dark One to continue chiseling away at his prison until he burst free, at which point they believed that no force at humanity's disposal would be able to contain him.

   The other, proposed by Lews Therin himself, was to take a circle of the most powerful Aes Sedai to Shayol Ghul and re-seal the Dark One's prison. This plan was considered highly dangerous — Lews Therin himself admitted that there was little chance any of them would return, even if they succeeded. Furthermore, if the seals were improperly placed, attempting to re-seal the prison had the potential to completely rip it open instead. As it seemed that the plan to use the

   Latra Posae Decume
   vocally and publicly opposed Lews Therin's plan, and made a pact with all the female Aes Sedai strong enough to be considered for use in Lews Therin's raiding party not to aid him. This "
   Fateful Concord
   ," as it was later called, essentially nixed Lews Therin's existing plans, as the circle that he believed would be needed could not be formed without the cooperation of women. As such, the plan to use the

   was approved by the Hall. However, Decume's public and vocal opposition to Lews Therin, and particularly the fact that the Concord's membership was composed entirely of female Aes Sedai, began to polarize both the Hall and the Aes Sedai as an organization along male/female lines.

   overran the region where they had been undergoing construction. Fortunately, knowledge of the Keys had been contained to the highest level of the Light's military command, and Sammael never discovered their existence. With the Keys lost, Lews Therin argued again for his plan, reiterating his belief that using the brute power of the Choedan Kal would do nothing to actually contain the Dark One. He acknowledged the risks his plan was laden with, but believed it to be the only option humanity had left. However, Decume maintained her opposition, and the number of women pledged to the Concord had grown even to include women who were nowhere near powerful enough to take part in the proposed mission. This caused the polarization of the Aes Sedai to spread to unprecedented levels. Eventually, the Hall approved of a number of plans to retrieve the keys, but none of them succeeded.
  </p>
  <p key="eb9448bd-6cb9-4147-bc95-a39d21039985">
   As the debate continued, armies led by Demandred and Bel'al initiated massive offensive operations against the forces of the Light, which were barely contained. To make matters worse, Sammael began conducting a renewed offensive from his newly conquered territory. As the fighting from both these fronts threatened to overrun the areas with the actual Choedan Kal
   <i key="790b7a9d-10f4-45e6-bf44-e6e176bf9339">

   , it was speculated that the Shadow had discovered the existence of these new weapons and had begun a massive push to take them. These offensives and heavy fighting elsewhere, combined with wide-scale riots and demands by the Light's population to make peace, stymied the Light's efforts even further. It became clear to Lews Therin that, if any of the three offensives begun by the Forsaken managed to break through the Light's lines, the final defeat would be only months away. In light of Decume's continued opposition and the continued failure of the efforts to retrieve the access Keys, Lews Therin decided that he needed to take matters into his own hands.

  <p key="bccc8f9f-1131-4a0d-a96a-a6eafe8753c5">
   Due to the gender-based polarization of the Hall, a small group of powerful young male Aes Sedai had emerged over the course of the war to vocally support Lews Therin against Decume. Popularly called the "Hundred Companions" (though there were actually one hundred and thirteen of them by the war's end), Lews Therin called upon them to undertake the raid on Shayol Ghul without help from any female Aes Sedai, planning to circumvent the Hall completely. As the Supreme Commander of the Light, Lews Therin was able to gather an "honor guard" of around ten-thousand soldiers without the Hall becoming aware. With these forces, Lews Therin

  <p key="7e26f2bc-4172-4c21-aa46-bcc80abeb3d9">
   Details are sketchy, since every man of the ten thousand died, the sixty-eight male Aes Sedai that survived went mad instantly, while the rest of the Hundred were thought to have been killed. What is known for certain is that, despite having no female aid, the re-sealing appeared to have been accomplished perfectly; the seals were all placed properly, the prison's overall integrity had remained intact, and the Dark One was once again rendered unable to touch the Pattern. To sweeten the victory, the thirteen most powerful of the Forsaken had been at Shayol Ghul for unknown reasons when the Bore was sealed, trapping them in Shayol Ghul and depriving the Shadow of it's most powerful warriors and most capable tacticians in one fell stroke.

   However, all was not as it seemed, for sealing the prison had had a number of terrible consequences. In re-sealing the Dark One's prison, Lews Therin and his Companions had evidently needed to touch

   , driving Lews Therin and his remaining sixty-eight Companions completely insane on the spot. All of them immediately began a rampage across the world, destroying and killing indiscriminately. This madness drove Lews Therin in particular to murder his entire family and everyone else at his estate, and then to commit suicide when he realized what he had done. Additionally, the seal was apparently not as strong as the original prison itself had been, as

   alone had been used to patch the Bore, which was but one aspect of two aspects of the Power that had been used to originally construct it. Though it was not known at the time, the seals would eventually weaken, threatening to allow the Dark One access to the Pattern again and freeing the Forsaken who were trapped there. Finally, the most powerful of the Forsaken,

   However, other than Lews Therin and his companions going mad, the effects of this couter-stroke were not immediately seen. To most, it appeared as though the Dark One's prison had been sealed, and the Shadow's leadership decapitated. The remaining Shadowspawn armies and the lesser Dreadlords were engaged by the armies of the Light, which included Decume, who evidently performed deeds of such greatness as to earn the title of Shadar Nor, which translated into later tongues as "Cutter of the Shadow" or "Slicer of the Shadow". Though the armies of the Shadow were routed, the true extent of the Dark One's counter-stroke soon began to manifest as the taint began to drive all male Aes Sedai insane. Some succumbed quickly, others took years, but inevitably, the taint drove each of them as mad as Lews Therin and his Companions. The only uniform aspect of this madness appeared to be an unprecedented desire/compulsion to destroy and kill with the Power. Entitled the

   </a>
   , this disaster was prolonged for many decades, and caused such devastation that civilization essentially ceased to exist until all the male Aes Sedai had died. It also caused destruction on such a cataclysmic scale that the surface of the world was irrevocably altered. Seismic activity in particular appeared to have been the underlying cause of the worst of the destruction. How and why the destruction was so widespread and thorough, or why the insane male Aes Sedai appeared to have been so unstoppable despite the existence of many female Aes Sedai, is unknown.

   During and after the war, a number of Aes Sedai had a series of Fortellings which were compiled into the

   . Apparently, before the Breaking, it had been realized that the patch on the Bore was imperfect, and that the Dark One would someday destroy it. The prophesies of the Karaethon Cycle were recognized as being a set of guidelines for the next incarnation of the Dragon, and every effort was made to preserve some form of them. Ultimately this endeavor was successful, as numerous copies of the prophecies survived into the Third Age, and their existence was common knowledge. Additionally, a number of other plans to aid the
