The subsequent flow of commerce has allowed Taren Ferry to prosper, creating a community with more than one inn and cobbled streets, features considered luxuries to the residents of southern villagers.  Buildings in the town are constructed on raised redstone foundations.

   The people of Taren Ferry blend Two Rivers culture with that of the outside world. Surnames in Taren Ferry often do not follow the traditional conventions of the "al" prefix - a legacy of Manetheren heritage.  Rather, surnames in Taren Ferry are based on other influences, with examples being "Hightower", "Hilltop", and "Stoneboat".
   Citizens of Taren Ferry do not celebrate

   so the town is quiet on nights when celebrations are occurring in southern villages.  Men from the town are well known as hagglers, tricksters and fast-talkers,
   leading other Two Rivers folk to distrust them and use pejorative terms like "
   <i key="4e4328c2-16d3-4f35-8116-cb82cbbb1cf9">

   " or "

   </i>
   "" to describe them.
   Taren Ferry folk seldom visit Watch Hill, Emond's Field, or Deven Ride and tend to look down upon those communities by referring to them as the "lower villages".
   Local culture has evolved around the constant flow of commerce through the town and the influence of merchant dealings.  As a result, bloodlines of residents are mixed with foreigners.

   Taren Ferry enjoys a unique economic advantage as the singular gateway into and out of the Two Rivers region. All merchant caravans traveling south to Watch Hill, Emond's Field, and Deven Ride must first pay a toll to utilize the ferry system, and must pay again to travel north to Baerlon. Additionally, as a function of his office the Mayor of Taren Ferry observes the flow of goods and enforces Tarrifs. This ability to lay and collect taxes on merchants represents greater executive power than is held by mayors of lower villages who merely observe commerce to ensure a fair marketplace.  The town therefore prospers more from the movement of agricultural commodities through the community than upon the actual farming of the products. Taren Ferry also does brisk business in several inns, and there are many craftsmen, horse traders, and brokers in the town.

   eventually attacked Taren Ferry.  The lack of a town wall left the community exposed, a vulnerability exploited by the shadowspawn.  As a result, the small contingent of Children of the Light fled and the citizens of Taren Ferry were left open to slaughter.  More than half of the population of Taren Ferry was murdered - including the Wisdom - and many structures were destroyed.  Peace came to the community after the

   After suffering extreme depopulation, those who survived returned during the late summer of 999NE to begin rebuilding the community.  A new Village Council and Women's Circle were established under the political manipulations of Faile Bashere Aybara with a focus on providing the most basic necessities for survivors - food, water, and shelter.  The new Wisdom,
