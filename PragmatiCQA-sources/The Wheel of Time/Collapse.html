     Up to this time, the denizens of the world had only to deal with the evil within themselves. If motivations for war and hate were removed, then so were the resultant activities. The Bore changed all of that.
     The fabric of society began to unravel under the onslaught of the Dark One’s influence. A large part of the horror came from the simple fact that for many years, no one knew why this was all happening; chaos seemed to be welling up from nowhere, without cause.
     It was during this time that such brutal sports as sha’je dueling came briefly into vogue. Sha’je duels, held at Qual, involved the use of left- and right-hand daggers, called respectively osan’gar and aran’gar, tipped with slow poison… In some parts of the world, in the years immediately preceding the final collapse into war, murder, rape and even torture became regular parts of many spectator sports."

   's ability to influence hearts and emotions. Brutal sports and treacherous politics became more and more common as the Collapse wore on, and the art of war was rediscovered through these often fatal confrontations. This slow corrupting influence lasted a little more than a hundred years; slowly persons of power and prestige converted to the Shadow, either publicly or in secret.

   The Collapse has parallels with the Christian concept of the Fall. In both cases humankind lived an existence of relative bliss and innocence. A woman (Lanfear in the Age of Legends and Eve in the Garden of Eden) partook of something that was forbidden and introduced evil into the world.
