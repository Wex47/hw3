This proves that having the spark does not necessarily mean stronger channeling ability, as Nicola and Sharina had to be  taught to channel and they are more powerful than any Aes Sedai in centuries (except the aforementioned). However, most of the women (except possibly Cadsuane) mentioned to match or be more powerful than Nicola have the spark, indicating that the strongest channelers are almost always born with the spark.
