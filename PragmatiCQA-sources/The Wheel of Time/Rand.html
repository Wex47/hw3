   A side-effect of this event was that Rand and Moridin became linked by body and soul. Rand begins to see another face in his mind's eye and Lews Therin refers to there now being three of them and that each one of them are "destroyers". The effect is mirrored in Moridin, who can feel whenever Rand is injured. This overlapping in consciousness increases with time with Moridin being able to speak to Rand. Eventually, this will lead to a consciousness swap where Rand inhabits Moridin's body, allowing him to live on after his battle with the Dark One and his old body, that contained Moridin's consciousness who wanted to die, is burned with the assumption that it is that of the Dragon Reborn.

   to the continent. Alternatively, they may have spawned from the Karaethon Cycle as it was known in the time of Hawkwing and been changed, mistranslated or altered for political reasons. It is also possible that these prophecies are more accurate and it was the Westlands one that became corrupted, and this is the Seanchan belief. The most obvious difference is that their versions say that the Dragon Reborn will kneel to the

   A skeptic, however, may say this is part of a complex hallucination or inferred from other information. This would not be true, however, as Rand is able to recall facts such as Sammael's real name, Tel Janin Aellinsar. Rand thinks to himself that "No history recorded the name, no fragment in the library at Tar Valon; Moiraine had told him everything the Aes Sedai knew of the Forsaken".
   His mental image of Ilyena's golden hair matches the women we see killed in
   the opening of the whole series
   .
   The Forsaken use the term "web" rather than weave in their point of view.
   Lews Therin also makes astute observations about the identity of the

   inside their head before Rand is even aware of him. Even harder to dispute is the sudden ability to draw portraits to assist Rand in the search for the renegade Asha'man.
  </p>
  <p key="f8bc0723-a072-4798-8f6b-b74382a65b48">
   It should also be noted that Rand does not have all of Lews Therin's memories and that he gained more memories as the series progresses. He does not, for example, recognise Lanfear nor Asmodean face to face.
  </p>
  <p key="9a9f3a68-70ef-4f91-9e53-9c0ea0d0d652">
   Whether Rand possesses (at least part of) Lews Therin's knowledge is a subtly different to whether the voice in Rand's head is real or not. This is less easy to prove. After Nynaeve discovers that she could Heal the Taint-induced madness of the Asha'man
   she Delves Rand as well for madness, and she discovers that the entirety of his mind is so heavily covered with the web of tiny thorns of blackness that it seemed impossible to her to remove. She is surprised by how could Rand even
   <i key="d60bb74d-2a2f-40e9-8b99-8dd6ed8feab5">
    think
   </i>
   with that on his brain. She also, however, discovers that there is a protective glowing white insulation between the web of thorns and his brain.
   <i key="49c40a55-60f7-4062-90c8-8d7330fdf0b0">
    "Light given form and life. Coated each of the dark tines, driving into Rand's mind alongside them."
   </i>
   This implies that Rand received some kind of protection from the Taint from the
   <a href="Creator.html" key="710578c4-db76-4e20-a7fc-22a03e2ec2dd" title="Creator">
    Creator
   </a>
   that should have long ago driven him to madness and, going further, that Lews Therin could not be a product of a madness whose cause is the Taint. Indeed, after Rand's epiphany on Dragonmount, he has he realisation that he and Lews Therin are one. After that point, the merging of both personalities and memories is complete and he no longer hears the voice. When he meets with Egwene in the White Tower, he states that he can remember Lews Therin's life "as a clear dream".
