   Before she completed her first step away from the pillar, she experienced a vision from the pillar even though she did not step into the pillars. The vision successfully tempted Aviendha into entering the glass pillars for a second time. This vision did not seem to be caused by anything Aviendha did. The pillars seemed to act of their own will, giving the vision to Aviendha to force her to enter the pillars again.
