Unfortunately for Liandrin, Be'lal was killed in a subsequent encounter with Rand and Moiraine. Then, two of her followers were captured by Egwene, and finally the Stone of Tear itself fell to a surprise assault by

Liandrin stated that she would not attempt such a betrayal, but the moment she thought the Forsaken's guard was down she deviously tried to do exactly that. Moghedien effortlessly parried the attack before subjecting Liandrin to extreme anguish and temporally placed a weave of true Compulsion upon her before removing it again. Cowed into submission, Liandrin accepted her new status as a minion to Moghedien, though in secret she decided to wait until a time when the Forsaken might become weakened when she would strike again.
