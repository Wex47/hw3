   allows the user to see their future, laid out for them many many times in variation. Hence an apprentice can be understood to be the equivalent of an Accepted at the White Tower, bypassing the rank of

  </p>
  <p key="4844f8b7-ddae-432d-8c4e-a5eafefda614">
   After this first test, the apprentice undergoes training in various aspects of being a Wise One. From the use of the One Power, and Dreamwalking, to the use of herbs and medicine, depending on the student's abilities and talents. In the mean time, she must also serve the Wise Ones much as
   <i key="4680bdb3-7205-4091-85b7-12a2abedc556">

   do, by making tea, tending the sweat tents, etc.
  </p>
  <p key="78d5c0df-0ca4-4b8c-b0d8-8a7202f85e2b">
   When an apprentice's training is complete, she would be subjected to menial, and increasingly meaningless tasks without any further training, until she declares herself ready to be a Wise One. This step of the training is often confusing to the apprentice, as she would not know why she was being subjected to such seemingly unfair treatment. However, the rationale is that the apprentice must see herself as an equal to the Wise Ones rather than be told she is ready, and therefore thinking independently rather than remaining obedient as an apprentice would.

  <p key="092f6d29-b5a3-4fa7-9ed2-f424dc71796e">
   When the apprentice has declared she is ready, she is welcomed by the Wise Ones to their sisterhood, though she must return to Rhuidean to enter another

   , the Shaido Wise Ones able to channel are described to be around four hundred. If more or less each Aiel Clan collects the same amount of female channelers it can be calculated that the female channelers among the remaining eleven Clans are around 4400 in total, an impressive amount considering the Aes Sedai are around 1000 (even considering also that among the Aiel Wise Ones there are almost a thousand very weak channelers that are not even considered to be tested for the shawl in the White Tower).
  </p>
  <p key="3ad5e9bf-2c5f-4b40-8d78-1ae8e2957d16">
   This can partially be attributed to the fact that all women who can channel are discovered by the Wise Ones, and there are no
