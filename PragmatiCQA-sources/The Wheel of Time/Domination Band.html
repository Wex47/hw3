   , the Domination Bands were dangerous to use because they did not prevent the man from going mad. They are also imperfect because, given time, he will eventually be able to control the woman as well as she controlling him. Even removing the bracelets wouldn't be possible without the man, as surely as the man needs a woman to remove the collar. While
