   the age restrictions have been lifted, and there are novices of all ages, even some as old as grandmothers. This is causing consternation among some traditional sisters, but most are happy that the number of Tower initiates has ceased dwindling and also because the potential of new older novices as

   Once a woman was tested and was found to be able to learn to channel, she would continue to touch the Source even without training. The Aes Sedai used this life to hold on to any girl who could channel, as it would not be safe to let them loose without proper training. By the time they were trained enough to be safe, they were usually set on the path to becoming an Aes Sedai that few thought of leaving.

   Novice life is deliberately harsh, in order to prepare them for the difficult life of an Aes Sedai. When a girl becomes a novice, she is required to burn the clothes that she arrived in, in order to symbolize a break with her past ties and build dependence on the Tower. Her room is tiny, the bed uncomfortable and hard, and she must wake every day before dawn to scrub the floor and sweep the room. Meals are taken in silence and are extremely brief, so the novice must eat quickly or go hungry. She will have lessons and classes; some on learning to

   , geography, politics and philosophy - to all of which she must pay strict attention or face punishment. Novices also have classes on the history of Aes Sedai, about channeling in general and classes on uses of the power such as

   . However, most of her day will be taken up with such chores and duties as laboring in the kitchens, scrubbing floors, doing errands for Aes Sedai, and working in the gardens.
  </p>
  <p key="4678b32a-147b-4491-b03a-547f81ddbba8">
   Novices are not permitted to channel except when supervised by an Accepted or Aes Sedai (though many do so anyway in secret), and must do all their chores by hand. The idea is that the hard work builds character, though it is likely that there is a desire to keep them too busy, and too tired, to start playing around and experimenting with the
   <a href="One Power.html" key="55876a72-c442-4b1a-8c24-3863bece2086" title="One Power">
    One Power
   </a>
   . Novices are strictly confined to the Tower grounds, and there are no days off, except for occasional freedays where there were no lessons or chores, except possibly chores given as punishment. There was no set schedule for these; the Mistress of Novices declared them at discretion. During the 130 days that Nynaeve and Egwene were in the White Tower, there were only three freedays.
  </p>
  <p key="314f6e4d-df48-41c0-82d0-b517c4b8d82f">
   In order to learn to channel, weaves are demonstrated at a strength too low to be effective. This was done simply in ordr to show the flows and the manner of weaving them. Novices were forbidden to try any weave themselves unless a sister had demonstrated it, and was satisfied that the novice could make it properly. No experimentation whatsoever in the Power was allowed, and novices were always closely supervised when channeling.
  </p>
  <p key="e85e01ab-ff9e-4ab7-aa34-05587edf1200">
   Novices are subject to strict discipline, decided and handed out by a sister appointed to the post of

   </a>
   . She is both disciplinarian and confidante, punishing those who have broken the rules and providing a shoulder to cry on as life as a novice is very hard. It is she who decides when a novice or Accepted is ready to be tested (though the same could be proposed or vetoed by certain combinations of the Amyrlin, Sitters or ordinary sisters, but it was always more difficult to propose than to be vetoed as it was safer to wait than to speed up a testing), or if the girl will be put out of the Tower for good. Punishment ranges from a lecture to a severe switching, and extra chores are usually involved. For all that Aes Sedai act like they rule the world, within the Tower there are hierarchies and rules, and discipline and obedience are instilled from the earliest days. In addition novices are carefully cloistered from men. It isn't that the Tower disapproves of intimacy, but that they don't want their novices thinking too much about hearth and family. Relationships between two novices or Accepted, known within the Tower as "
   pillow friends
   ", are commonplace and unremarkable.
  </p>
  <p key="26c7bb4c-c1d6-48db-8c9a-181a3d4415b8">
   Understandably some novices find the pressure too much, and resolve to run away. They rarely get away with it, usually being caught and returned. Life for a captured runaway makes ordinary novice life look pleasant, with anything less than perfection being swiftly and harshly punished. The reason given is that a half-trained channeler is a danger to herself and those around her, which is not untrue, but it is also the case that the Tower considers itself to have absolute right over all channelers, and does not permit them to leave until it is finished with them.
  </p>
  <p key="b106fba2-f53a-4bad-ba14-cf73b8c07922">
   The novices studying under the rebel Aes Sedai have been arranged into "families" of seven or eight women, making them much easier to organize and also establishing close friendships that help novices to get through the day. This new development has meant that this faction has almost no runaways to deal with. It is unknown whether this new organization has been adopted within the now-united Tower.

   Ten years normally is also the time a woman of average strength needs to reach her full potential in the One Power.
