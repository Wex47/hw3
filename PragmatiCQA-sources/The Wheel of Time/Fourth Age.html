   Pact of the Griffin

   Tarasin Palace
   ; Oncala deliberately withheld the fact that these plans were only contingencies to be used if the Westland nations attacked the Seanchan first.

  <p key="ee133d4d-4fda-4ebe-a151-69caa0d36c9a">
   Oncala's ruse succeeds. Decades later, the war has gone badly for the Westlands and Aiel. Every nation and the

   hold
   , but this too is razed. The last Aiel scatter and become impoverished nomads unable to support themselves, eventually degenerating into a near-feral scavenging people who call themselves the Folk.

   By then, the Raven Empire seemingly dominates the Westlands uncontested. The Empire's technology has advanced to the point that firearms, automobiles, and electric lights are commonplace, and a railway is being built across the Aiel Waste to link the Empire with Shara.
