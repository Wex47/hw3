   The ability of Warders to protect their respective Aes Sedai through these heightened abilities is paramount for them, for if she dies, he will most likely go insane with a sense of fatalistic vengeance.

   It is also possible to create a switch in bonding if an Aes Sedai knows she is going to die. In the case of Moiraine's death, Lan's bond immediately switched to Myrelle, which meant Lan could not waste his life on the spot.

   If a Warder dies, his Aes Sedai grieves deeply but does not go insane. Some sisters resist bonding another after their initial choice dies of old age or falls in battle. Green Ajah sisters instead frequently choose to bond another as soon as possible, which led in part to

   Both male and female channelers are able to 'mask' a bond they have instigated, cloaking it to avoid the emotional awareness in inopportune circumstances, and even muting the geographic awareness when necessary. The ability is somehow related to the ability to channel, as non-channelers are completely unable to avoid feeling what the other person feels, even when it is not desired.

   It has recently been confirmed
   [1]
   that Warders can be released from their bonds, although it is done rarely under normal circumstances. However, if an Aes Sedai is able to prepare for an unavoidable death, she may release her Warders to spare them the uncontrollable desire for revenge and death, and in rare instances a Warder may be released voluntarily while both are still hale and hearty.

Once Siuan was Healed, she felt all the pain again, which indicates, Healing restores the Warder bond to that level, even after the death of a Warder.

   at the time, but it was also unorthodox in that her Warder is female. No previous instances of this are recorded, and the side effects have been interesting. Both women have experienced embarrassing moments of emotional 'leakage', where one's strong emotion (embarrassment, anger, passion) is fed through the bond to the other, who experiences the emotion themselves, instead of merely being aware of it. Additionally, their cycles have synchronized.

   There is no information about whether this version of the bond provides the same benefits of the Warder Bond. E.g. Warders' hardiness, or the susceptibilities to death of either person. Presumably with the harsh training and dangerous conditions that

   go through, it would have been noted if their wives had gone into an insane rage when they died. As the bond is presumed to be independently discovered, it is likely that it does not provide those additional benefits and drawbacks.

   's task to capture and gentle the entire Black Tower is disrupted, she and most of her fellow sisters are bonded by full Asha'man in a manner very similar to the wife bond. Curiously, the reaction to the bond that Toveine experiences appears to be very similar to a
   female orgasm
   . This is not the "extra bit" referred to, however; instead, the bond used with the Aes Sedai allows the Asha'man to require obedience from their bonded sisters.
   It may or may not require active channeling with Spirit, as is required to gain involuntary obedience by an Aes Sedai from her Warder. There is no sign yet that this can be circumvented by channeling, as Rand appears to be able to do with Alanna.

   While they were arguing,

   bonded
   Androl
   by surprise and he, enraged, bonded her in response
   , forming a unique double link; this kind of bonding enhances the sharing of emotions, sentiments and even thoughts between the people involved, becoming a form of telepathy.

   The double bond significantly changes the behavior of a circle involving the two channelers.  Every time one of the two touches the One Power, the other is immediately put in circle with them, which differs from the normal requirement that a woman start and form the link and the normal behavior that a channeler cannot be drawn involuntarily into a circle without the use of a

   </a>
   designed for that purpose.  Each channeler can take control of the circle using his/her willpower, while in a normal circle, control can only be passed willingly and, in addition, a circle consisting of one man and one woman must normally be controlled by the man.  The Forsaken did not think it was possible for a woman to control such a circle; they could not have discovered this method, because the Warder bond did not exist during the Age of Legends.

   have a previously unseen type of bond, which joins two individuals as 'siblings' whatever their age and parentage. It is used to adopt someone as a
   first-sister
   or
   first-brother
   in their society, and is never done lightly. A wealth of conditions are imposed to ensure that the pair truly wants to become family, and failure or avoidance at any point results in immediate denial. The ceremony is performed by a

  <p key="ca953d94-088f-42b9-a33f-f5525e7eb54b">
   The end result is similar to a weaker form of the Asha'man/wife bond; the pair can sense each other vaguely, and share some level of psychic link, although the close friendship that precedes this bonding ceremony makes it difficult to tell what portion of this mutual understanding is due to the weave, and what is due to shared affection for each other. Neither of the pair have to be able to channel for the bond to work. Also, it is never done to a woman with child as the child would die.
