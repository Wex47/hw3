Marriage between the Amayar and Atha'an Miere is all but unknown, as each group finds the others' ways to be strange and unpleasant. Despite this, the two get along very well, probably due to the easygoing and fair nature of the Amayar.

   Amayar culture is rural. For the most part, they raise sheep, goats, and small cattle, oxen, and horses. Although they do not receive the credit for manufacturing Sea Folk porcelain, they barely give it a thought, as they like the prices that they receive and mainlanders keep away from their homes in their ignorance.

They gave their children a poison that put them into a deep sleep from which they did not waken. It seems there was not enough of that to go around, so many of the adults took slower poisons.
