   Maidens have their own "handtalk" or sign language which consists of finger spelling as well as complete words and phrases. Many societies, male and female, have their own set of handtalk, but Far Dareis Mai are the only ones that have nearly a full language in handtalk alone. It is known only to other Maidens, though

   as his honor guard. When he first comes to the Waste he tells the Maidens that they "carry his honor," a task they take very seriously. Though he has no society or sept, he was born of a Maiden and is regarded by them as "the first son of a Maiden to come back to us." They will not allow his honor to be represented by any other group, and feel gravely slighted when left behind by Rand - they cannot comprehend his reluctance to commit them to battle (because of his aversion to any harm coming to women).

     "I am the spear. When a lover came between me and the spear, I chose the spear. Some chose the other way. Some decide they have run with the spears long enough, that they want a husband, a child. I have never wanted anything else. No chief would hesitate to send me wherever the dance is hottest. If I died there, my first-sisters would mourn me, but not a fingernail more than when our first-brother fell. A treekiller who stabbed me to the heart in my sleep would do me more honor than you do. Do you understand now?"

   , the Maidens definitely do not take his commands as law; but they, more than most, readily disobey his commands that they consider "foolish." They listen to Rand's instructions in battle, but they find it unacceptable when he leaves them out of the battle - and they are willing to show their anger when he treats them as somehow less than the other male societies. At one point he is severely beaten while in his private chamber with
