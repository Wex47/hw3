   The Mistress of Novices is expected to be a harsh-yet-fair woman. She serves to carry out punishments on her charges, which usually take the shape of a strapping or switching. However, she may also set manual labor, such as working in the kitchens.She is the ultimate authority over Novices, and as such she is also responsible for bringing them to their test for Accepted. Despite her seemingly negative role in the life of a Novice, it is not unheard of for her to be a comforting shoulder to those who feel the pressure hardest.

  <p key="085d4747-58aa-4947-831d-80b1e0ee76f1">
   She is also responsible for the discipline of Accepted, and is generally considered to be harsher on them than Novices, as it is believed that they should know better.

   Aes Sedai can even be sent to her for a penance, though it is rare and ultimately humbling for the Aes Sedai.

   The Mistress of Novices is traditionally appointed by the
   <a href="Amyrlin Seat.html" key="0bafe187-91f4-4807-8d95-35543d935f9a" title="Amyrlin Seat">
    Amyrlin Seat
   </a>
   ; there are some instances of a Mistress of Novices being forced upon an Amyrlin by the
   <a href="Hall of the Tower.html" key="62f32188-53a4-4355-91f5-5a30210f3df5" title="Hall of the Tower">
    Hall of the Tower
   </a>
   , although this is rare. Traditionally, a new Mistress of Novices belongs to the same
   <a href="Ajah.html" key="26981fb0-290c-42a6-bdcb-bc3aee12c7b7" title="Ajah">
    Ajah
   </a>
   as the Amyrlin was raised from, but much like the
   <a href="Keeper of the Chronicles.html" key="4ed9d8ab-e19c-4d93-a8c4-ad051a040e30" title="Keeper of the Chronicles">
    Keeper of the Chronicles
   </a>
   , this is not absolute and the Amyrlin may appoint a Mistress of Novices from a different Ajah, either to favor that Ajah or because the woman is extremely competent.
  </p>
  <p key="dfdf873c-86b6-4a49-b099-e5fc5960c077">
   Traditionally, the Mistress of Novices may be dismissed and replaced if she outlives the Amyrlin Seat, as seen with
   Amira Moselle
   replacing
   Merean Redhill
   after the death of
   <a href="Tamra Ospenya.html" key="c36d57db-e9ca-4b57-af3c-6db6b377a66a" title="Tamra Ospenya">
    Tamra Ospenya
   </a>
   . However, there are exceptions, as
   Sereille Bagand
   was considered such a legendary Mistress of Novices during her time in office that she served for one hundred and seven years under three different Amyrlins.
   . Indeed, Merean herself served under two different Amyrlins, having served under the previous Amyrlin,
   Noane Masadim
   , as well as Tamra Ospenya.
  </p>
  <p key="c1760600-28ba-4b0e-b42e-a83b7600ec14">
   The Mistress of Novices does not serve at the Amyrlins pleasure any more than the Keeper does, and can only be removed by the greater consensus of the Hall of the Tower except in the case of certain specific misdeeds, in which case only lesser consensus is required.
  </p>
  <h2 key="7a8087f7-2711-436d-b330-1bb2a14d63ab">

  <p key="a4a39807-882e-4769-998e-889469253827">
   With few exceptions, it requires at least the lesser consensus of the Hall of the Tower to override the Mistress of Novices regarding almost anything to do with her charges. Some things are set in the law, including strictures against singling out any girl for either favor or censure without cause, but by and large she can reward or punish as she chooses to.
  </p>
  <p key="13560388-4edb-4c8a-b8d7-56f62f6a2e3c">
   The manner in which novices are fed, clothed, and housed is largely in her control. The manner in which Accepted are fed, clothed, and house is only somewhat less controlled by her. Accepted are given individual rooms, or even apartments, since there are fewer of them, for example, and she cannot make them all live in the small cubicles given to novices; an Accepted as well as a novice can still find herself feeding on bread and water, and while Accepted are allowed more jewelry than novices and are seldom called down for excessive, ornament, at least once they had progressed a little, she can restrict them just as severely as the novices if she chooses to.
  </p>
  <p key="37138141-ff3b-43b3-81c3-e686e3d009c2">
   The authority of the Mistress of Novices over her charges is such, according to the law, that she can in some cases defy the Amyrlin Seat or anything below the lesser consensus of the Hall of the Tower, or in some cases, the greater consensus. An Aes Sedai who is instructing novices or Accepted can send a novice or Accepted running on any task, or send them to the Mistress of Novices' study, but it is the Mistress of Novices who decides what punishment to dole out, if any, and the sister who sends the girl has no say. The Mistress of Novices is heartily offended if any sister tries to take a hand. By law, not even the Amyrlin Seat can tell the Mistress of Novices what reward or punishment to give any novices or Accepted.
  </p>
  <p key="8f98906d-2685-450b-8887-e6b433786abb">
   Many Mistresses of Novices say that the girls in their charge are theirs and that the girls belong to them. This attitude is generally accepted by the sisters. Some Mistresses of Novices use this to be unremittingly harsh on their charges, but it was also used to protect the girls from sisters, Sitters, and even the Amyrlin Seat. All Aes Sedai are goddesses in the eyes of the novices, and not much less in the eyes of Accepted, but even the Amyrlin Seat has to go through the Mistress of Novices for almost anything concerning both novices and Accepted.
