   Egwene is described as wanting to learn everything, as fast as possible; she chafes against the restrictions her teachers put on her, even those set for her own safety.
   Moiraine Damodred has made note of Egwene's social intuition; while she may not understand the private or secret machinations going on around her, she is often (at least) aware that they are happening.

   She holds a fairly unique perspective of the role of Aes Sedai in society, having spent only a short time as a Novice in the White Tower before being taken by the Seanchan and subsequently training with the Wise Ones. Her opinion of the Tower as an organization, however, remains very high, and she believes the Aes Sedai thinking that the White Tower should "guide" Rand to achieve the best outcome for the world.

   She also has exceptional ability with weaving Earth, as shown by her talent for

She also has strength in Spirit as evidenced by her ability to still an Aes Sedai holding the Source while she was only Accepted and her Dream-related Talents. By her own admission, she is also very strong in Air and Water, which are usually favored by female channelers. She is very well rounded when compared to others in the tower. Having great ability in all five of the Powers is rare and seen in only a handful of Aes Sedai and Asha'man.

   As with many very strong channelers Egwene has the so called "fast learner" Talent, in fact for her it is enough to see and study the forming of a weave only few times to memorize and learn how to reproduce it.

However, they are both captured, having been betrayed by Nicola Treehill when the sly novice left the rebel camp for Tar Valon. Leane and Egwene are both drugged with forkroot, which temporarily makes them unable to channel.
   Egwene was taken by the White Tower Aes Sedai and demoted to a novice at Elaida's command. She notices that many among the Tower are at each other's throats and plans to exploit that from within, viewing herself as an agent rather than a prisoner. Her refusal to treat the Tower Aes Sedai with the deference and courtesy expected of a novice leads to repeated corporal punishment, which she takes in stride. Meanwhile, she sows the seed of discord among the Aes Sedai, many of whom have already begun to question Elaida's leadership.

   Egwene gains the respect of prominent Sisters and Sitters when they invite her to debate with them. Ferane, for instance, compliments her on her logic, and Suana, Head of the Yellow, recommends the Ajah to her. During these moments, she tries to Heal the bridges between the Ajahs, knowing that the Last Battle approaches, and that the White Tower as it is, is woefully unprepared for it.

The White Tower is to be emptied and all novices and Accepted based in Mayene, where they will Link with the sisters there to provide extra channeling power. Egwene then confronts Leilwin about her business. Leilwin swears a very strong oath to serve Egwene. Egwene is unsure about accepting the oath but asks her to give as much information as she can on the Seanchan empire. 
At first the Aes Sedai are only used sparingly on the Kandori battle-front. Egwene confronts Bryne and asks him to actively use the Aes Sedai in battle, as this is what they have trained for. He agrees. Egwene then leads her channelers against the forces that have destroyed the country. Initially the heavy use of the One Power by the Aes Sedai seems to stop with success the invading forces of the Shadow. Egwene hears news that Dreadlords have begun attacking Lan's army. She charges Bryne with sending a message to the Aes Sedai outside the Black Tower, asking them to return in order to re-enforce the Borderlander army.

   . The women talk about the troubling dark cracks that are appearing, particularly when balefire is used. They all decide to ban the use of balefire. Amys tells Egwene that she is proud of her and the group then farewell each other. She wakes to find that Rand has come to meet with her before he goes to Shayol Ghul. Rand shows her a ribbon he had kept for her, for when Egwene was of age to braid her hair. The two embrace each other, even though they still do not see eye to eye about the matter of the seals. Rand asks to see them one last time. Rand goes still when he touches them and asks if she is trying to fool them. He tells Egwene that what they hold are not in fact the seals but duplicates. At some stage Darkfriends must have stolen them and now have the Dark One has the keys to his own prison.

   and tells the Aes Sedai around her to release the Source. The Aes Sedai camp is attacked, destroyed and occupied by the Sharan's. In the chaos of the surprise attack, Egwene and Gawyn are trapped under an overturned wood cart and, because of the presence of a large amount of Sharan soldiers and channelers, are unable to immediately escape the seized Aes Sedai camp. Egwene is unable to use the One Power because the Sharan channelers would immediately detect her embracing it, even if she were to invert her weaves afterward. So they are forced to wait for night to come for an opportunity to slip out of the camp. While they are trapped, they see Bao the Wyld (Demandred's assumed identity), appear and address his followers. He detects a female channeler in the camp, and Leane appears, wrapped in flows of air. Bao gives her a message to deliver to Lews Therin: he is here to kill Lews Therin, and if he fails to appear Bao will kill all his followers, seize his lands and utterly destroy everything he has worked to create. Bao names Rand a false Dragon, stating he, Bao, is the true savior of the world. Bao walks off into the camp, Leane in tow, and after some time Gawyn and Egwene make their escape attempt after dark. Gawyn takes the lead, scouting ahead, with Egwene twenty paces behind. While hiding in the shadows, Egwene is suddenly shielded by a Sharan channeler, who foils Egwene's attempt to stab her by also wrapping her in flows of air. While the unnamed Sharan explains how she will subjugate Egwene to Bao's will, Egwene uses the emotional connection of the warder bond in an attempt to alert Gawyn of her predicament by allowing her fear and near-panic to flow through it to him. As she attempts to communicate with him, Leilwin, who had previously sworn fealty to the Amyrlin, creeps up from behind the Sharan and knocks her unconscious. They are soon rejoined by Gawyn, then Bayle Domon, and make their escape to the White Tower.

Fortuona agrees to fight, and will recognize the sovereign borders of the nations as they stand now. The Seanchan will also not force obedience on channelers that do not violate their borders. Egwene insists on the Seanchan releasing the control of Tremalking. The Seanchan have no leader set up there and do not acknowledge the Seanchan as rulers. Fortuona agrees when she sees Egwene's logic. Egwene agrees to let Seanchan emissaries come to Tar Valon, where they will have free board and collar any woman who wishes it.
