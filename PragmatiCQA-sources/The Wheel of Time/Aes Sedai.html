Additionally, due to the social structure of the Age of Legends being based on how well one served society, the Aes Sedai as an organization were held in extremely high regard and were very well respected due to the fact that, with the advantage of being able to channel, the Aes Sedai contributed extraordinarily to the betterment of humankind.

   Current Aes Sedai differ greatly from those from before the Breaking, most notably in their organization and their level of knowledge. Present day Aes Sedai are organized into what is known as the White Tower. Only those women accepted by the White Tower can be called Aes Sedai, and all other channelers are known as

   . Additionally, their overall philosophy has changed drastically, and not for the better. Modern Aes Sedai, by and large, are trained not only in the Power, but are taught how to manipulate those around them. As observed by Nynaeve and numerous others, most Aes Sedai tend to place the White Tower's status, authority, and well-being above all other considerations. As such, they are seen as being very self-interested and self-serving. Many Aes Sedai excuse their behavior with the justification that whatever is best for the Tower is best for the world, but needless to say, this outlook is not shared by others. Additionally, the implementation of the Three Oaths, which make Aes Sedai incapable of telling an outright lie, have backfired with regard to their effectiveness. This is due to the fact that Aes Sedai simply use metaphorical doublespeak to circumvent the Oaths, and people are well aware of it.

   Most people in the Third Age trust neither the intentions nor the words of an Aes Sedai, and many others outright hate and fear them. Due to their tendency to meddle in the affairs of others, and their poor reputation, the Aes Sedai have many enemies and few allies. They are still very respected in the

Despite the strict hierarchy based on strength in the One Power, a Sister's strength or standing compared to other Sisters is not usually openly discussed, and it is considered rude to do so.  Rather, Aes Sedai naturally expect weaker Sisters to submit to the authority of stronger Sisters which younger initiates learn on their own without explicit instruction.

   This means that a Sister's social or economic status prior to joining the White Tower has little to no influence on her standing within the establishment. A quite strong Sister born a commoner can easily outrank a sister born into a great noble family and holders of certain positions of power rank at the top. Morgase Trakand who is recognized as being given the right to wear the Ring was more a formality as a link to the Andoran Royal Family and her position as Queen, but her ability to channel was so little that she was seen as being below even the newest of Novices in the Tower.

   Each Ajah has its own hierarchy and internal positions of authority, and the women in charge of each Ajah are collectively known as Ajah heads, though the nature of the position differs from Ajah to Ajah. It is unusual for an Ajah head to also be a Sitter, but not unheard of. Sitters are answerable to their Ajah heads for their actions in the Hall, and for the most part all Aes Sedai must obey the authority of their Ajah heads in general, especially regarding Ajah matters. Though the names of Sitters are public knowledge, the identities of the Ajah Heads are a closely guarded secret of each Ajah and as such they have no extra authority outside their Ajahs.

  <p key="0fef4bc1-6b61-4413-9c8a-1a435fbef513">
   During the last three millenniums Aes Sedai developed a very specific method of training to teach how to form weaves using
   <i key="d9decb73-cfe3-49c0-9ed8-632a55d132dc">
    saidar
   </i>
   . Their first goal was to ensure no danger in the trainees, the second to teach the most effective kind of weaves in every matter; despite it this method showed some limitations if confronted to the methods followed by other groups of female channelers.
  </p>
  <p key="332e58ad-6e4c-4e41-a600-e9bc8ebe44d3">
   In weaving the threads Aes Sedai developed unnecessary  gestures, so particular and specific that you could trace who taught the weave originally based on minor quirks.

   </a>
   do not use a lot of gestures, their weaves can seem rough and in some cases less effective, but this avoided some problems linked to gesturing. The first problem is that if you have the hands occupied or bonded you can't form a weave properly. The second problem is that a specific gesture, repeated many and many time to form the same weave, imprints itself in the mind of the channeller, so she can't easily learn a new manner to form it. For example, when new effective healing weaves were invented or rediscovered, many Aes Sedai imprinted by the traditional healing weaves were not able to learn easily the new ones.
  </p>
  <p key="a998ffc0-3b9a-4a1f-a720-809e58ac35bf">
   Another limitation demonstrated by Aes Sedai is their behaviour in experimenting with the One Power, they are very conservative, they are inclined to use only the weaves that they knew well, discarding innovation and originality as dangerous.

  <p key="c6da5082-ad2a-4e96-92f2-f7e4514a1a67">

   The name Aes Sedai and their magical nature comes from Irish myth, specifically from the
   Aos Sidhi

   universe
   . The group is described as an exclusive sisterhood whose members train their bodies and minds through years of physical and
   mental conditioning
   to obtain
   superhuman
   powers and abilities that can seem magical to outsiders. Sometimes called "witches" due to their secretive nature and misunderstood powers, the Bene Gesserit, like the Aes Sedai, are loyal only to themselves. However, to attain their goals and avoid outside interference, they often screen themselves with the illusion of being loyal to other groups or individuals. As their skills and knowledge are as desirable as an alliance with the Sisterhood itself, they are able to charge a fee to school the females from Great Houses, and install some of their initiates as leaders, wives, and prominent figures to their advantage.
