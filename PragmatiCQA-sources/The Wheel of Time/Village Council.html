    Village Council

   of each community is an all-male eight-member committee whose councilors are elected by the corresponding villagers and nearby farmers. Each council is headed by a
   Mayor
   who is elected in a similar fashion and serves as one of the eight members.
   Village councils are common in communities outside the Two Rivers as well.  In most places these councils will make decisions affecting their areas as a whole and will negotiate with councils of other villages over matters jointly affecting the communities.

  <p key="c374492c-98d7-4614-a2d9-ceb7e7a18667">
   Village councilors establish economic policy with merchants, peddlers, and the councils of other communities. Twice each year these councils will assist their mayors in observing trade with visiting merchant caravans that travel to the Two Rivers to purchase
   Tabac
   and wool. The primary function of the Mayor in this regard is to ensure a fair marketplace for all participants transacting within a village's sphere of influence. Councilors will also engage in the resolution of disputes related to property ownership.
   In extremely rare cases, councils have sent out patrols if villages believe they are being victimized by outsiders seeking to steal property from locals.
   While the elections for mayors and councilors are usually peaceful in the three smaller villages, campaigns in Taren Ferry have been known to become quite contentious, sometimes leading to prolonged quarreling among townsfolk.
