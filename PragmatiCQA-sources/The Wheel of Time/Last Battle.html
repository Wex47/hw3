   The Last Battle was prophesied in several accounts of many people, the most central one being the

  <p key="485e8ab2-87c3-47a4-bd1f-9fe0dff0bf37">
   According to prophecy, if the Dark One had prevailed he would have escaped from his prison and remade all of time and space in his image. The forces of the prophecies did not include a clear, specific outcome to the Last Battle, specifics of this eventuality, and it has proven a subject of some debate between philosophers.

   , others say that he will bind the Nine Moons (the sigil of the Seanchan Imperial Court) to him; it is possible these conditions are not exclusive of one another. It is also possible that Ishamael may have tampered with the Seanchan version of the prophecies, or that Seanchans turned them into propaganda themselves.

   However, the Prophecies specifically state that the clearest sign of the Last Battle will be the return of the dead to plague the living. Early in
   1000 NE
   inhabitants of the Westlands, possibly the whole world, began to see images of people long dead, sometimes just individuals but sometimes entire long-destroyed cities or towns that appear and then vanish. Around this time 'ripples' in the fabric of reality were detected, suggesting that the entire

   because the Dark One's prison must be whole once more when the Wheel of Time turns and the Age of Legends comes again, when the Aes Sedai of that Age create the Bore in the first place.

However, that engagement seems too detached from the other assaults by the Shadow to be part of the Last Battle, as no other significant Trolloc armies came out of the Blight for two years after this skirmish.

   The Shadow had consolidated its forces in the Blight before the Last Battle, readying a huge force of Shadowspawn. The Shadow sent trollocs to invade the lands of mankind in 4 different points. All invasions were independent from the others, and designed to occupy the forces of the Light on multiple fronts at the same time.

   Battle of Maradon
   . After a very successful holding action at the fortifications outside the city, Ituralde's force was eventually overwhelmed and forced to retreat to the city. Unfortunately, it was commanded by a Darkfriend who refused to allow them in, citing that they were forigners. After a revolt by the remaining Saldaean forces in the city the army was let inside the walls. However, after a short siege the walls were breached with help of male Dreadlords in the Shadow's forces. Ituralde took to street fighting inside the city, stalling the trollocs as he hoped for reinforcements from the Dragon Reborn. Ituralde's tactics were brilliently successful and the Trollocs fell in droves, but their sheer numbers allowed them to pressure Ituralde's forces and whittle them away.

   After suffering grievous loss, Ituralde's forces were rescued by reinforcements sent by the Dragon Reborn. With the help of Davram Bashere's army and a number of Asha'man, the Trollocs were driven from the burned remains of the city. Shortly thereafter the Dragon Reborn destroyed the entire Trolloc army with the One Power, but it was only a slight reprieve.

By Lan's estimates the trollocs outnumbered his 12 thousand men 10 to 1, and maybe more. However, the Gap's topography allowed for a relative small force to defend it. The Trollocs were forced to a grueling slow advance, and gained ground only when helped by channelers.

   Out of the four invasions, only two had succeeded - Kandor was overrun and Caemlyn fell. If all four would have succeeded, It seems likely that the entire north would have collapsed. The forces of the Shadow could have marched forward, surrounding
   The White Tower

   However, the two successful invasion caused some heavy losses to the forces of the Light. The loss of Caemlyn meant a moral blow to one of the most powerful nations, and a loss of a major supply depot for the forces of the Light, given that Caemlyn was under the influence of the Dragon Reborn, guarding it fed the Shadow's taint. It also gave rise to much dread from other nations who had waygates, fearing they would fall too. The most strategic advantage was of course putting a vast army at the heart of mankind's lands, behind their major lines.

   The fall of Kandor, though significant, could not achieve its maximum effect due to the failure of the invasion to Saldaea and Shienar. However, it did give the Shadow a foothold at the borderlands, killed many shadowspawn-trained soldiers and captured many human slaves to help the Shadow's support lines.

  <p key="690cff1f-e51d-47f2-b122-f3481655b944">
   As they enter Tel'aran'rhiod they find a great tempest. The winds of the great storm can be felt everywhere around Tel'aran'rhiod, and they seem to wear the terrain down. At first, it just seems a form of 'erosion at high speed', but soon, as the Last battle rages on, the effects are much more intense. Perrin also notes that the world is breaking apart in other ways, such as the ground erupting, sending chunks to the air.
  </p>
  <p key="ac814ed7-32b6-4a86-a90a-c8ec89afca77">

   Indeed, the Dreamspike was most probably not used by Slayer, but by M'Hael. Slayer was tasked with killing Rand as he was confronting the Dark One. Perrin is unaware of this, but deduces that Slayer will show-up somewhere along the various battle fronts anyway. He asks the wolves to keep a watch and notify him if they see Slayer. However, the first sighting reported to him is not of Slayer but of

   inside Caemlyn against attacks by Traveling. Caemlyn itself was a good defensive position for the Shadow. After the initial invasions the Fades reined in the Trollocs, and half of the city still stood, as well as its walls (excepting the part destroyed by the Band during the invasion).
  </p>
  <p key="aafa153b-59c7-4c8a-9b2b-6f0a5256f914">
   Besieging it was not an option, as the trollocs could feast on many of the human occupants still in Caemlyn or get supplies through Traveling, and the Light's forces were needed elsewhere, as the Kandori and Shienarian fronts were only to hold until they were finished. It was also not possible to just leave them, since from that position the trollocs could send armies to threaten all of the southern kingdoms and destroy the Light's supply centers, such as

   . Alternatively, the Shadow could launch an army at the back of the defenders at the Borderlands, trapping them. And so it became clear that the Trollocs army in Andor must be defeated and destroyed.

   noted that he approved of this plan and had often worried about an attacking force establishing itself at the Wood and threatening Caemlyn.
  </p>
  <p key="a17f1a83-6759-4816-a5df-db4942476326">
   The first step was to flush the trollocs from Caemlym itself. Using the Kin, Bashere's forces planted oil (supplied by Mayene) in many of the still standing buildings' basements via Traveling. Setting it all aflame at once, the trollocs were forced to pour out of the city, where the Light's forces waited to bait the trollocs into giving chase.
  </p>
  <p key="a2077477-6cd1-4b77-9b72-11b29bf031c5">
   However, the trollocs did not take the bait, and camped around the city and on its walls. The Light forces turned to 'hit and run' attacks in order to force them to pursue, and after several attempts succeeded, as the entire trolloc army went after them. The Light forces guided the trolloc army towards Braem Wood, where on the brink of the woods waited a company of Two Rivers archers and two banners of crossbow men from the Legion to break the pursuit.
  </p>
  <p key="88cd04ab-3314-4515-8c79-19a986015fa4">
   As the trollocs broke, they split their forces - some making for the woods and others heading east, toward the roadway winding around the Wood. Taking the roadway, the trollocs could surround the Light's forces in the Wood. As the Light forces drew the first force deeper into the woods, the Band's dragons waited at the roadway for the second force. The dragons succeeded in almost completely destroying the trolloc force at the roadway, gaining no casualties themselves. The trollocs were now boxed in the Wood.
  </p>
  <p key="cf9132c4-277a-4678-93c1-267f9c44bc45">
   Inside the Wood, the aiel and other forces killed many trollocs, using ambushes and guerrilla tactics. However, their efforts proved to be not enough - the trollocs having quickly adapted and avoiding ambushes. As the trollocs gained control of the entire southern section of the Wood, Bashere announced that the operation at the Wood had done all the good it could do, whittling down the numbers of the enemy's forces. Since the dragons were no use in the thick forest, they were now needed to draw the trollocs once more into the open.

   , where there are no bridges. The Band will build bridges and after the army crosses the river - torch them. Dragons will also be used from the far bank to hurt the trollocs approaching the river. They will repeat the process over the
   River Alguenya
   , and head towards Cairhien, finding a better position in the hills surrounding the City. Elayne is reluctant, as just moments before she was advised about the hurried retreat at the Shienarian front, but eventually agrees as she has little other choice.

  <p key="5f7fe695-40f4-47d5-bd96-ca77dd140885">
   The army advances east in the Wood and uses the whitecloaks and the Ogier to cover their retreat. As they cross over the Erinin and march towards the Alguenya, waiting for the bridges to be built there, a vanguard of the trolloc army managed to reach their location. The Light's forces hold against the attack with the aid of Rand, under the disguise of
   Jur Grady
   .
  </p>
  <p key="19835144-b991-4d8c-a624-7fa9fcd15c1b">
   However, as they cross the Alguenya, Bashere's scouts discover a trap - a second trolloc army ahead of them, moving on the city of Cairhien. The discovery unsettles Bashere, as he feels he should have anticipated it. He deduces that it isn't a second force sent somehow south of the Blight, but part of the original force that split off from the rest at the Wood, hurrying through rough terrain to beat them to Cairhien. Bashere claims he didn't take into account how far the Fades would push the trollocs, and risk many casualties in the forced march. The result is that Elayne's forces are trapped between two armies - one to the south building rafts to cross over the Alguenya, and one to north threatening the defenseless city (whose defenders are with the army).
  </p>
  <p key="ca5f1f1b-cdde-440b-9207-568517060d66">
   Bashere suggests to march towards the northern force before it can take the City. He rejects ideas to Travel into the City, arguing that they must completely destroy the northern force, not wait for it to be joined by the southern force as the Light is besieged. Their only hope is to take it out as quickly as possible, using the fact that the trollocs must be tired from the forced marching, and then wait for the southern force to arrive.
  </p>
  <p key="5c1e4540-25b9-4d5a-bdc1-e4065bc6d1ac">
   Elayne agrees. The army leaves a company of bowmen and some of the dragons to stall the southern force trying to cross the river with orders to retreat when overwhelmed. Meanwhile, through use of Traveling by the kinswomen, the remainder of the army moves to confront the northern trolloc forces, placing themselves between the trollocs and the City. However, as they are successful at engaging and surrounding the trollocs, Elayne learns that the southern force will shortly arrive, one full day ahead of schedule.
  </p>
  <p key="76f68945-8aa6-4ea5-adef-fdb069189791">
   Bashere is baffled, and contemplates several destructive ideas that have no way of succeeding. Tam confronts him and accuses him of knowing about the southern force's push. Elayne confirms this after hearing from Bael that the aiel were not used as scouts, thus deducing that the scout reports were forged by Bashere. Elayne denounces Bashere as a darkfriend and removes him from command. By this time, there is no way to retreat since the kinswomen are too tired from helping the army Travel ahead of the northern force. The army have the northern force surrounded, and is forced to try and destroy it as quickly as possible before the southern force arrives. However, it seems like a lost cause, since Light's forces will be left too tired from the fighting to stand against another army of Trollocs.
