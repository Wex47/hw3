   By this time, the spring of
   FY 943
   , over a third of the entire continent was under his control, and even in regions far from the warzone many came to believe that only the true Dragon Reborn could achieve so much. The nations of

   started seeing similar discontent among its people.
  </p>
  <p key="929ff992-1198-4e57-aa0a-a8cc45780e08">
   With Amalasan looking ever more undefeatable, it fell to Artur Paendrag Tanreall, already dubbed 'Artur Hawkwing' for the speed with which he could move his armies, to face him in battle. Hawkwing had fought Amalasan several times already, but only as part of a larger contingent of troops. While Hawkwing had not suffered major losses to Amalasan, he had not been able to score a decisive victory either. In the spring of FY 943 Hawkwing was leading an army, accompanied by several Aes Sedai, out of Shandalle and

  <p key="7638266a-d3f0-4326-89d7-c877492c9345">
   This was the decisive engagement of the whole war, and both armies came to it unexpectedly. Amalasan is believed to have been leading a massive flanking assault into Tova to cut off reinforcements headed for Khodomar, but was not expecting battle so soon. His and Hawkwing's scouts stumbled into one another south of the pass, near the town of Endersole, and both armies deployed for battle.
  </p>
  <p key="e482f62c-3d14-4b77-b3bf-81b630b12180">
   Hawkwing's army consisted of 23,000 infantry and 12,000 cavalry. The make-up of his army is unclear, but the fact he was in command suggested it was mostly forces from Shandalle itself, although the records indicate troops from
   <a href="Tar Valon.html" key="bd0386d6-f459-45b7-aef6-c6a2f8f09843" title="Tar Valon">

  </p>
  <p key="560c7ec2-36c6-46f9-980f-bc6d72c7412f">
   Amalasan's army was considerably larger: 41,000 infantry and 26,000 horse. However, the terrain did not favor the use of cavalry and Amalasan dismounted a large amount of his mounted force.
  </p>
  <p key="13f49773-afe4-4226-bf92-fc6b54ccaad6">
   The battle went Amalasan's way, although quick redeployments of Hawkwing's lines prevented his forces from being encircled. At the end of the day's fighting both armies had suffered severe casualties, but Amalasan could afford the losses. Hawkwing began a retreat to the pass and Amalasan decided to let him go to rest his troops and begin the pursuit in the morning.
  </p>
  <p key="13f1471b-7256-479b-9e8c-b815b3e1e58a">
   However, Hawkwing instead split his army in three, sending his cavalry (accompanied by the Aes Sedai and Hawkwing himself) on a night ride of almost fifty miles into Amalasan's rear and sending his two infantry wings to strike Amalasan's flanks. This was in contravention of military doctrine: Hawkwing's troops had already been fighting for hours and were too few to gain a decisive breakthrough. However, the sheer panic that the three-pronged attacked sent through Amalasan's army nearly brought about its collapse. Just as Amalasan was starting to rally his troops, Hawkwing and the Aes Sedai led a cavalry charge on Amalasan's position. Amalasan was taken, shielded from the One Power, and removed from the battlefield. This caused his army to break and run. Unable to spare the time to pursue and destroy Amalasan's forces, Hawkwing and his force headed north towards Tar Valon with all speed.

   Hawkwing's badly-blooded army undertook a forced march from the Jolvaine Pass to Tar Valon, the better part of a thousand miles. It is unknown whether he gathered additional reinforcements from Shandalle or other kingdoms along the way. What is known is that in defiance of

  <p key="1d7af15f-8716-4afe-9243-3b8aea0f3088">
   At the same time, news of Amalasan's capture had reached his lieutenants fighting on other fronts. Within three days of the Battle of the Jolvaine Pass, General Sawyn Maculhene withdrew 50,000 men from the fight in Khodomar to march on Tar Valon, while Elinde Motheneos led an even larger force north from Esandara. The combined force, exceeding 100,000 men in number, marched up the western shores of the Erinin and launched a surprise attack on Tar Valon itself, capturing two bridges over the Alindrelle Erinin and entering the city in force. In response, Hawkwing led his army into the city from the opposite side of the river, resulting in bloody and bitter street-to-street fighting which raged even to the foot of the White Tower itself. Maculhene was killed during the fighting, and with Amalasan already

   , Khodomar, and Tova, apparently fearful of Hawkwing and declaring him a renegade for defying White Tower law while on Tar Valon territory, launched a joint invasion of Shandalle from the west, south, and east respectively. It is unlikely such an invasion could have been carried out without the Aes Sedai knowing about it, but the Aes Sedai made no move to intervene in this conflict. Some historians suspect that Amyrlin Bonwhin, infuriated that Tar Valon had been saved by a man acting in defiance of Aes Sedai orders, had decided that Hawkwing could not be allowed to continue his reign.
