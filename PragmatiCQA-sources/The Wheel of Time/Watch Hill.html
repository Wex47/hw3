   ruled the region, a watchtower was constructed in this location to take advantage of the excellent view and defensibility of the hill. After the
   Battle of the Tarendrelle River
   and the subsequent Battle of Aemon's Field, the nation of Manetheren perished and the watchtower was left abandoned. Later when farmers returned to the area to establish a community, it is believed that they named their village after the mysterious nearby ruin. Whether by the theft of its blocks by needful farmers or the unrelenting erosion of the elements, no trace of the old tower remains.

   Like the other villages in the Two Rivers region, Watch Hill practices a form of gender-based
   bicameral
   government.
   Governance is officially controlled by a

   consisting entirely of men who are elected to office by villagers via popular vote. The council is headed by a mayor who is elected in a similar fashion. The current mayor of Watch Hill is

   .
   Additionally, a second ruling body called the

   Edelle Gaelin

   who has served the community for more than twenty years. As in the villages of Emond's Field and Deven Ride, political control of Watch Hill exists as an ongoing willful struggle between the Village Council and the Women's Circle. In general however, the Village Council tends to regulate economic matters and the Women's Circle holds sway over social issues. Though Watch Hill continues to assert political independence, recently many villagers, including Mayor Barstere, have begun to defer to Lady

   . Like all inhabitants of the Two Rivers, villagers of Watch Hill are known for a strong streak of stubbornness, a legacy of ancient Manetheren. As a consequence they are a hardy folk unwilling to give up even when times are tough. While on the surface it may seem to outsiders that the conflict between the Village Council and the Women's Circle is forever ongoing, villagers are actually fiercely loyal to each other. As a result they will fight united with every fiber of their being to protect their property and way of life.

   After the Battle of Emond's Field, villagers of Watch Hill began to regard Perrin Aybara as a sovereign lord. This prompted Edelle Gaelin to lead an envoy from the Women's Circle to Emond's Field to see if Lord and Lady Aybara were "right for the Two Rivers".
   After concluding that they were indeed worthy of rulership, the village council added its endorsement. Since that time, Edelle Gaelin has frequented Emond's Field in the company of
