   the same time as Rand did, and the two beams crossed over each other and touched. As a consequence of this, they have formed a connection: Rand then often saw Moridin in his mind when he channeled. The link worked both ways as Moridin was also aware of Rand. The sensation Rand had was of them each touching the other, but not physically. Rand then suffered nausea when he first reached for

   While dreaming one night, Rand found himself in one of Moridin's
   dreamshards
   , their link to one another having pulled him there without either he or Moridin willing it. Upon seeing Moridin, Rand immediately reasoned that Moridin was the reincarnation of Ishamael, and was angered and horrified to learn that others amongst the Forsaken might have been resurrected as well. However, during a relatively genial chat with Rand, Moridin informed him that the only way to ensure one of the

   servants remained dead was to kill them with balefire. He also expounded slightly on the connection he shared with Rand, though he admitted to not understanding it. The two of them discussed the timelessness of Rand's struggle and Moridin's belief in its ultimate futility. He also revealed that he was feeling exhausted, and wondered out loud whether the exhaustion he felt was Rand's or his own. He also mentioned to Rand that he believed that he knew the truth about the Dark One's intentions - that the Dark One intended to destroy creation forever. He went on to cite his contempt for the other Forsaken, mocking them for believing that they would receive eternal life and power. However, the idea of the end of creation seemed to please him, as he gave a laugh that had "true pleasure in it," as opposed to other, humorless laughs that he had exhibited during the conversation. Before leaving, Moridin asked Rand why Rand had come to his dreamshard, but then speculated that it was their link that somehow drew Rand to it.

   . He also showed her a prophecy of the possible death of Perrin. In doing so, he revealed that a chamber within his palace appeared to be full of powerful relics from the Age of Legends. Graendal seemed to have a very difficult time controlling her fear of him during this meeting as opposed to the last time she met with him. She also made an observation that Moridin would understand Rand's feelings of guilt for destroying her lair and its inhabitants, but did not elaborate much. During the meeting it appeared that Moridin was able to receive commands directly from the Dark One without being at Shayol Ghul. Around this time, Moridin's attitude began to attract the attention of some of the other Forsaken as being distinctly different from that of Ishamael. Virtually all of his vindictiveness, cruelty and sadism essentially vanished, and he took to carrying out his tasks in a somewhat mechanical fashion. More often than not he was silent and seemingly detached.

Rand is pulled into Moridin's dreamshard via their connection. Rand reveals that he knows that Lanfear lives again. Moridin tells him that her name is now Cyndane and she now hates Rand.

He rushes Rand and the two of them engage in a swordfight in the now lava-less Pit of Doom. Rand eventually touched this hole with his foot, which froze both of them in place while Rand confronted the Dark One himself outside of reality. When Rand managed to overcome the horrors of the Dark One's assault, Moridin stabbed Alanna in the heart in the hopes Rand would lose control when the holder of his warder bond died. However, Alanna was able to release Rand's bond before she died, so Moridin then stabbed himself in the right hand, knowing that his connection to Rand would cause him to drop

   Dying, Rand managed to bring Moridin out with him as the cave collapsed. They were both moved to the camp by Shayol Ghul for healing. Unbeknownst to everyone at the camp excepting Min, Aviendha and Elayne, Rand used his connection to Moridin to swap bodies, putting Moridin in his own dying body while taking Moridin's body for himself. This was enabled due to the fact that Moridin, above all else, wanted to die, while Rand wanted as badly to continue living. Once the transfer was complete, Moridin died in Rand's body, and was cremated on the Dragon's funeral pyre.

   Upon being reincarnated as Moridin, Ishamael initially kept most of his former personality traits. However, as time passed his personality changed drastically. Though his madness was said to have been even greater as Moridin than as Ishamael, he exhibited a preternatural calm most of the time, and appeared to have left both his pride and his desire for power behind him. Additionally, he lost any hint of sadism that he had once had, and took more often than not to simply brooding in silence. Instead of the fanaticism he had once possessed, he changed to becoming fatalistically devoted to seeing the Dark One triumph, as he believed that his service to the Dark One would grant him his truest desire; to die so completely that he would never have to be reborn again. This desire was brought on by an overwhelming sense of self-loathing, and utter despair regarding what he saw as the inevitability of the Dark One's victory. This desire was apparently so strong that, rather than being punished (both for dying and for impersonating the Dark One) upon resurrection like the other re-incarnated Forsaken, the Dark One deemed that returning Ishamael to life in and of itself was punishment enough. His insanity, therefore, took on an omnicidal tone rather than a power-mad one, as the only thing he wanted was to bring about a permanent end to the world as quickly as possible. However, he did appear to suffer from violent mood swings at times, thought they were very, very transient and he tended to regain control very quickly. Several comments from Graendal suggested that, before his conversion to the Shadow, he may have been much like Rand al'Thor. Indeed, the two of them, even as mortal enemies, appeared to get along oddly well during their numerous conversations in Dreamshards, and before re-integrating Lews Therin's memories with his own and recovering, Rand nearly destroyed the Pattern in a nihilistic despair similar to Ishamael's own.
  </p>
  <p key="19cf57f5-ccd3-4c85-9fe9-3760fbadb260">
   Ultimately however, despite understanding a great deal about the nature of the Pattern, he ultimately failed to realize the true nature of the Dark One, having believed that the Dark One would have allowed him the peace of oblivion despite the fact that the Dark One was completely incapable of granting peace or rest of any sort.

   Apart from being one of the most powerful male channelers - as strong as Lews Therin Telamon - Elan Morin Tedronai was also one of only a few male Dreamwalkers. He used this talent extensively, communicating his orders to Darkfriends via their dreams. He trapped many Darkfriends in Dreamshards to punish their failures, and he also used tel'aran'rhiod to lure the three ta'veren. He also spent much of his leisure time in very subtly twisted Dreamshards. His favorite settings appeared to be realistic places that contained warped or impossible elements. His typical setting involved sitting alone in front of a fireplace that radiated no heat, with disturbingly human-shaped flames and clouds bursting and contorting, and burning rats behind the fireplace. Others involved places like a platform floating on endless water with people chained under the waves, perpetually drowning and being eaten by giant, unseen predators.

  <p key="bb531e2a-7813-4cfc-a8ca-c35f16de2a2c">
   As Moridin, Elan was granted essentially unlimited access to the True Power, as Rand al Thor, when drawing on the True Power through his link with Moridin, compared the amount of energy that he was able to draw on as comparable to drawing on both

   . His access to this power was so great that, when drawing upon it through Callandor, the Dark One was not able to shut off Moridin's access to it despite being its source.
