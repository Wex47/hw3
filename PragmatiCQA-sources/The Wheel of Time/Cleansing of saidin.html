   to that goal, it created something he had not directly intended. Rather than a tunnel as he thought would appear,

   was actually just an intricate, flowery-looking shape which was a tunnel of infinite and zero distance only relative to the Source and Shadar Logoth; from any other vantage point, it looked nothing like a conduit.

   into Shadar Logoth. Rand's theory was, that after channeling enough of
   <i key="57860888-03e9-4a96-b6e4-d2d05357a509">

   into the conduit, the taint would be drawn in its entirety towards a similar, yet polar opposite sort of taint; the evil residue of Shadar Logoth. After that, he would merely need to keep a steady flow of
   <i key="d01e50fa-93fb-4e9f-a25b-009eb743e7fc">

   In Shadar Logoth, a dome-like structure of black darker than black appeared, slowly rising out of the ground as if thick, viscous mud were being piled on the city. Towards the end of the battle, flames even darker than the mass of taint flashed throughout the bubble--Mashadar and the taint destroying each other. This created an immensely powerful whirlwind, sucking Moghedien towards the ruins, and left a gigantic crater sweeping the city.
