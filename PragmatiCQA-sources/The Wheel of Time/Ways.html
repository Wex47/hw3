   they do not share rules of space and time with the world outside. The pathways of the Ways exist as suspended platforms, bridges, and stairs. Often routes span in ways that defy logic with no visible supports. Travelers may walk for a day in the Ways and emerge hundreds of miles from their starting location in the outside world. Paths link areas known as Islands. Each island contains a navigational marker; a large slab of stone covered in Ogier script called a Guiding. The Ways used to be well lit by a 'sun' set in cloudless skies, with food-bearing trees on the islands. There was grass on every pathway and all the traveled routes were beautiful in the manner that Ogier loved. No evidence of these comforts now remain. The Ways also have had traps laid in them for

   the Ways began to change. Initially Ogier noticed that the light within the Ways was growing dim. Then travelers began to disappear. Eventually the light in the Ways grew so faint that the fruit-bearing trees on the islands began to die soon to be followed by all other growing things. Ogier began to fear traveling the Ways when some emerged crazed, raving about

The exact reason for the corruption of the Ways is a mystery, though it has been theorized that the Ways were corrupted during their crafting by the male Aes Sedai who channeled threads of tainted

   will attempt to attack and devour any creature it encounters, including Shadowspawn. The exact nature of the black wind is not understood completely, though it is known that it will consume the soul of any creature unfortunate enough to be caught by it. Unless it is pulled away, the soulless body of a victim will be subsequently mutilated and destroyed by the entity. Before encountering

   , travelers within the Ways may feel a slight breeze upon their skin, an abnormal event within the Ways where there should be no movement of air. As it approaches closer the sound of wind will increase to a roar and at its closest a traveler will begin to hear the crazed voices of the consumed souls of

Potential victims who are able to escape from the entity with their lives are often driven insane after exposure to these voices. The Black Wind doesn't appear to think or be sentient in any way.

   The last Waygate known to have been grown was the gate in
   Stedding Tsofu
   , approximately 600 years before the present day. It was also the last gate closed permanently. All Ogier now shun the use of Waygates and Ogier Elders have forbidden their use. In many

   treesingers have encouraged the growth of thickets and thorny plants in front of gates to inhibit efforts of the unwary. Those that summon the courage to enter the Ways risk death or insanity at a possible encounter with the Black Wind. Travelers must bring lamps with them and even with such devices the darkness of the Ways seems to suppress illumination. The stonework of the Ways is crumbling and some Guidings are so severely scarred as to be illegible even to those that can read Ogier script. It is possible for a traveler to become stranded if a required bridge has failed structurally. It is also feared that an unfortunate traveler might be present on a bridge during a failure. It is unknown what would happen to someone who is cast down in such a manner.
Because some Waygates have been swallowed by the Blight, it is believed that forces of the Shadow have begun to use the Ways to move massive amounts of
