   , Shaidar Haran intercedes (presumably incidentally as it was present in the tower for another reason) and forces Mesaana to spare her. When Mesaana challenges its decision, it burns off her clothing and binds her with black fire in preparation for punishing her for failing to participate in the Battle near Shadar Logoth. It then marks Alviarin in such a way as to prevent Mesaana from harming her, and charges her with uncovering the Aes Sedai who are hunting the

What became of this husk after Tarmon Gai'don is unknown.

   . The fear that Myrddraal stimulate in ordinary people with a glance appears to be present in Shaidar Haran, but in an augmented form; its gaze strikes the same fear in the Forsaken that normal Myrddraal strike in most people. In addition to this, it also appears to wield some unusual form of black energy, which may or may not be connected to the True Power. It has used it on occasion to create orbs of colored light, and to create black fire. It has used this fire to destroy a length of spear out of frustration and to bind Mesaana in preparation for her aforementioned punishment. During its encounter with Mesaana, it also demonstrated the ability to change its size. It has also been implied that it has the ability to incapacitate people (or at least Aes Sedai) at will by an unknown mechanism and can nullify wards of the One Power. Its most unusual power however, is its ability to sever a channeler from the True Source at will. The sensation felt by the channeler is described as being so total that it is essentially the same as a true severing (stilled/gentled). Unlike a severing however, this effect is temporary and ends upon Shaidar Haran willing it so. As of yet, there is no mechanistic explanation for this ability. It has been implied on at least two occasions that Shaidar Haran may not actually be a Myrddraal by other characters. Once when Alviarin witnessed his punishment of Mesaana and thought that he was "the Great Lord, clothed in the skin of a Myrddraal", and again when he rescued Semirhage "she did not think this thing was truly a Myrddraal". Alviarin's interpretation was, however, tempered by a great deal of terror and ignorance. On this same occasion however, it referred to the Black Ajah as "its creatures."

  <p key="f0a28def-cc90-4ed3-84a6-7780cef4b469">
   Ultimately however, Shaidar Haran appears to have been acting as something of an incubator for bringing an infinitesimal portion of the Dark One's own essence into the Pattern. During Rand's assault on Shayol Ghul, it is implied by Moridin that Shaidar Haran had served as a vessel for a patch of what appeared to be absolute nothingness that was seen hovering behind a Myrddraal's corpse. Touching this nothingness evidently allowed one's consciousness to interact directly with the Dark One, drawing the individual into a realm outside the Pattern where it could be directly viewed in a metaphysical sense.

   <li key="57149d5c-f5f5-4924-9cdf-0e687ae7e5f2">
    There is also evidence that could show that Shaidar Haran is merely a powerful Myrddraal, as he states that there must be a way to break the bond to Shayol Ghul. This could also be taken as Shaidar Haran wanting to break the bond as to allow himself a longer period away from Shayol Ghul.
   </li>
   <li key="af710ead-dc60-4ba1-9e83-12ec6a95f736">
    It is also interesting to note that despite his incredible powers and his recently revealed ability to incapacitate the Dark One's enemies, he has never attacked either Rand or any of his major allies himself; even with standing death warrants by at least Moridin if not the Dark One himself, on Perrin and Mat. The reason for his lack of direct involvement has yet to be explained.
   </li>
   <li key="88b15ca6-c89b-4261-9756-c0772c77b535">
    Shaidar Haran's powers are largely limited to being used on people who have sworn to the shadow. Those who have not forsaken the Light are not subject to a great deal of what he can do, or perhaps him at all. That's why he doesn't directly go after Rand and his major allies - he can only go after Darkfriends.
