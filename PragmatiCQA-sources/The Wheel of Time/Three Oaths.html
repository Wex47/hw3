   , as much as 500 years beforehand, in response to the common people's distrust of Aes Sedai. It is noted that all three oaths were concretely in place by the end of the Trolloc Wars.
   This seems somewhat contradictory, but can be explained if all three oaths were not made mandatory until the Trolloc Wars, imposed only on some members of the White Tower or intermittently, with various Amyrlins or Halls adopting different policies.

   Recently it was discovered that use of the Oath Rod was actually reducing the Aes Sedai lifespans by half. In the days after the Time of Madness, Aes Sedai expected to live as much as seven hundred to eight hundred years, barring accidents. With the use of the Oath Rod their lifespan was reduced to a maximum of approximately two hundred to three hundred years.
   The oldest age any known Aes Sedai has reached is 306 for

   The cumulative effect of taking Three Oaths as opposed to fewer resulted in the phenomenon known as Aes Sedai "agelessness", the difficulty in being able to place an age on an Aes Sedai. This effect takes several years to take effect, as evidenced by the Aes Sedai chosen to capture

   notes that the so-called Aes Sedai of the Third Age "bind themselves like criminals", perhaps hinting that the ageless look is a sign of those bound several times, but may just refer to the original use of the Oath Rod as Binders.

   The prohibition on lying does not prevent an Aes Sedai from speaking words that are false, but that she believes to be true. It also does not prevent them from saying an obvious untruth with sarcastic intent. It does, however, prevent them from being able to lie in a letter in the same way.

   's test for Accepted where she says that "Once, Aes Sedai were not required to swear oaths. It was known what Aes Sedai were and what they stood for, and there was no need for more...we swear these oaths, that we are known to be bound, allows the nations to deal with us without fearing that we will throw up our own power, the One Power, against them. Between the Trolloc Wars and the War of the Hundred Years we made these choices, and because of them the White Tower still stands".
   This apparent contradiction may be solved partly through imperfect knowledge of the Aes Sedai, partly through the fact that Sheriam is secretly
