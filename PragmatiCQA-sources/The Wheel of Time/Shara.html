   lie to the east of both features, further inhibiting travel into Shara. The Cliffs of the Dawn are easily scalable only in six locations. The Sharans have built heavily-fortified towns in each of these locations, where trade is permitted with westerners (

   the Aiel permit to cross the wastelands). In each of these towns the residents go veiled at all times, and the walls are so tall that it is impossible to see into the towns from outside. Westerners are not permitted to travel through these towns' eastern gates into Shara proper. Those who try disappear.
  </p>
  <p key="26b5a77b-943e-435b-bd11-b392f9ac981f">
   South of the cliffs lies the Great Rift, an immense canyon which separates the Sharan interior from the Aiel Waste. No successful crossing of the rift has been recorded. The southern edge of the rift, which may be passable, is separated from the rest of the Aiel Waste by the

   Shara extends much further south than either the Westlands or the Aiel Waste and its southernmost tip crosses the equator. Shara's southwestern coast is extremely mountainous. The only easily-accessible harbors are located along the south coast itself. There are only five known ports on the south coast, and these are similarly classified as open trading ports by the Sharans.

   and western vessels are permitted to dock, but again traders are not permitted to travel outside the cities. The same immense walls are to be found here, but in this case they extend even across the harbors themselves.
  </p>
  <p key="9a9726e2-c919-451a-9b6d-dd0303345c25">
   Traveling to the east of the easternmost trading port is extremely hazardous and most vessels that attempt going east vanish. Nevertheless, over the centuries enough Sea Folk vessels have managed to return after conducting inconclusive surveys to put together maps showing the Sharan coast. These maps suggest that Shara extends for approximately 2,000 miles from the Aiel Waste to the Morenal Ocean and for approximately 4,500 miles from the Mountains of Dhoom to the Sea of Storms. The Mountains of Dhoom tumble into the sea similarly to the way they do in the Westlands, and there is at least one large island off Shara's east coast. Its name is unknown.
  </p>
  <p key="6a20946a-cf16-4cd8-a640-614916b887a2">
   Despite being far more extended than the Westlands, Shara does not seem to be very densely populated, in fact during the Last Battle the employed Sharan's forces (both armies and channelers) were surely huge, but not as if this east part of the continent is populated as the west.
  </p>
  <p key="6bacf807-c063-4df1-8285-77c32af9daa5">
   This could be caused simply by being a lesser developed country or maybe it is caused by the presence of some natural obstacle that does not permit the development of a major population. In this second case it can be guessed that the Cliffs of Dawn, so high, stop wet winds from the Morenal Ocean, provoking aridity in the Aiel Waste but huge rains in Shara, and so the presence of an enormous and almost impenetrable rain forest.

   The Sea Folk recorded at the time that the invasion force had successfully landed in several locations on the western and southern coasts of Shara. However, later reports suggested that the ships were ablaze in the bays and inlets where they had landed, indicating the invasion had been defeated. To this day, Sharan traders deny all knowledge of such an invasion taking place.

When they are sixteen they are taken from the village and are hooded and cloaked, and are matched with women who desire children, which is sometimes several. When they turn twenty-one, or show signs of channeling, they are taken from the village as if again to go breed and are instead killed and cremated.

Its alternative name, Kigali, is the capital of Rwanda in the real world. However, it also resembles Imperial China, due to its monopoly on silk production, the isolationist port cities, and an absolute monarchy that has ruled the nation for millennia. The names of Sharans often sound Chinese in origin, such as
