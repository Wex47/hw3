   ; although forgotten places are mentioned in the east. Like many other writers, Robert Jordan never officially names his world, so in lieu of another name Randland has come into accepted common usage so that fans have something to call it. It is possible that it is still called Earth as Lan Mandragoran refers to Malkier as being "wiped off the face of the earth".

   Although no scale appeared on the maps in the books themselves, a scale did appear on the world map on page 146 of the guidebook accompanying the series,

   . The scale on this map suggests that the distance from the edge of the continent on the west to The Spine of the World in the east is approximately 3,000 miles. This concurs broadly with the designers who worked on

   , who suggested a scale of 1"=400 miles on the color endpaper maps in the hardback editions of the books. By their calculations, the Westlands therefore measures roughly 3,500 miles from the west coast to the Spine of the World, making it approximately the size of the
   United States of America
