   Though as adequate a battlefield general as she was a researcher, she proved an appalling ruler (though by the Shadow's standards, she was positively brilliant and efficient in achieving their goals). Captured regions saw their children forced to attend schools teaching praise for the

   . Slow learning was punished by death, and she encouraged the children to spy on and bully each other. Mesaana encouraged children to isolate and harass children who were different. She had the children form large mobs and hunt down people from institutions of higher learning. Many children betrayed their parents and families because of her. During the second half of the war she also used them to carry out executions, at times forming "courts" entirely of children. Museums and reminders of old ways were destroyed; nothing could stand in the way of the Shadow's triumph. Such was the influence of these children that they came to be known as "Mesaana's Children".

   Mesaana ran the Black Ajah mainly through Alviarin. However, unknown to Alviarin, Mesaana had also contacted each of the other twelve members of the Black Ajah's Supreme Council, and had learned the identities of every Black Sister.  She didn't know as much about the Black Ajah as she deluded herself into thinking, though.

   Among Mesaana's accomplishments are causing and prolonging the
   schism
   between the Tower Aes Sedai and the Rebel Aes Sedai (by participating in, and perhaps even by causing, Elaida's coup, and by increasing the tower guards, among other things); widening the wedge between Rand and the Tower (by making Elaida sign the proclamation that recognized Rand as the Dragon Reborn while condemning him, and condemning all who had aided or would aid him). This also weakened Rand by reducing his potential support, and weakened the Tower by reducing its flexibility in dealing with Rand and by forcing Rand's allies to oppose the Tower if they wanted to continue supporting Rand. Mesaana also caused the internal strife between the Ajahs, weakening the Aes Sedai's unity.
