   When a target is struck with balefire, its thread in the Pattern is destroyed, in an amount proportional to the power of the balefire strike. This translates to both the target's existence, and actions up to a certain point, being retroactively erased. For example, when

   This can have serious consequences on the Pattern; the use of an extremely powerful blast of balefire to destroy a great number of lives at once has been shown to produce an effect referred to as a "
   balescream
   ," the sound of the Pattern itself groaning under the strain of rearranging itself around such a large gap. The use of balefire in great amounts, or in areas or situations in which the Pattern is already thin, can cause cracks in the fabric of reality; pitch black cracks will form in objects that appear to extend into complete oblivion. In most cases, these cracks simply turn into the mundane cracks of a damaged object within a few seconds. However, in situations of extreme damage to the Pattern, these cracks can widen and consume the reality around them. All events that could have been said to have "happened" before the destruction of an individual's thread are remembered by any other individual, though the physical reality of the situation is now changed; anyone that was witness or party to the "reversal" of time will still remember all the events that were undone as if they had actually happened even if the effects themselves no longer exist.

   Additionally, balefire will only travel a certain distance and will only penetrate through so much solid matter, depending on the amount of Power behind it. The stronger the blast, the farther it will travel, and the more matter it will be able to consume before extinguishing. It is also described as being phenomenally hot, though this property is somewhat irrelevant as the heat of the weave is presumably not what causes its reality-warping effects.

Intuitively, the more powerful a channeler, the greater the blast of balefire that can be produced. A relatively weak channeler like Moraine can only produce a stream around as thick as a typical human finger, while a channeler such as Rand al'Thor, who is as powerful as a channeler can be, can produce a stream thicker than the body of a typical man.
