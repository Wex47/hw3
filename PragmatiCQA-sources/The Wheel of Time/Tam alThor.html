When he accuses her of doing something to Rand to have made him so different, Cadsuane wraps him in weaves of Air and lifts him from the ground with his arms pinned to his sides. Nynaeve tries to argue with Cadsuane in his defense, but Tam says it is all right, that he has dealt with bullies before, and whether they used their arms or the One Power makes no difference.

The two trade blows with each other for awhile but Rand finds it difficult to fight one handed. Tam then fights Rand one-handed as well. During their bout, Tam keeps telling Rand to let everything go. Rand finally puts all his emotions away and concentrates on the duel.
