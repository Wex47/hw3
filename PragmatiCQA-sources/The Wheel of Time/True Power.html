   She talked about this to Moridin who was obviously not known by her, so Moridin may add +1 to the original twenty-nine. This may or may not be synonymous with the title of "Chosen". Regardless, it is clear that only a very exclusive elite within the followers of the Shadow are granted this gift from the Dark One, especially if one considers the very large number of channelers that have followed him over the Ages.

   It seems not to have the same limits as the One Power as to how much of it can be drawn. Rather, the Dark One himself appears to control how much a channeler can access. Rand, who was able to draw upon the True Power due to his strange link with Moridin, described the amount of energy that he held when first grasping it as being similar to drawing Power from both Choedan Kal, likely reflecting the level of access to the True Power that Moridin himself had. Before he was reborn as Moridin, Ishamael presumably drew enough of it to overpower

   before he was run through with it. Conversly, Graendal cannot draw upon it very heavily, as she is not as favored by the Dark One as Ishamael/Moridin. Even Demandred, who was very probably the second most favored of the Forsaken, was only able to draw upon a small amount of it.

   It also appears to generate a physical warping of the Pattern surrounding an individual; Rand was described as having a dark aura that could be almost more sensed than seen. This aura may have even caused an unusual decay of objects around him when he was feeling strong emotions (fresh tea becoming immediately spoiled for instance), and it produced feelings of unease in those around him when it manifested. With Rand, this aura could only be seen in one's peripheral vision, and if one attempted to gaze at it directly, it vanished. A much more evident manifestation of this aura was Ishamael himself. During the time when he called himself
   Ba'alzamon
   , he was almost constantly surrounded by an intensely dark aura which grew darker the stronger his emotions became. As Moridin, the only evidence that he possessed the aura was seen when Aviendha saw him watching her group go through a Gateway and she felt great fear at his presence, though all he did was watch her from a distance. Also, in

  </p>
  <p key="9ee8cc6a-a6af-45fb-a21e-3748777a2f3f">
   It is possible that extensive use of the True Power may give one the ability to communicate directly with the Dark One outside of Shayol Ghul. In one instance, Ishamael beseeched the Dark One for aid against a
   <i key="2bdc9e0e-ae50-4015-ba70-aebba2530762">
    Callandor
   </i>
   -wielding Rand, and the Dark One apparently allowed him greater access to the True Power in response. Additionally, Moridin appeared on several occasions to be able to receive instructions from the Dark One regardless of his location. No other Forsaken was ever seen communicating with him in this manner, and no other Forsaken used the True Power to anywhere near the extent that Moridin did (nor do they have anywhere near as much access to it). One of the wounds in Rand's side, the one given to him by Ishamael, is almost certainly a result of being burned with the True Power, and cannot be Healed by either the One Power or Rand's body's own natural healing processes.

   Balefire does not appear to have any unusual characteristics when woven with the True Power versus the One Power except for the added ability to destroy cuendillar, nor does it require any special knowledge to weave, as Rand was able to form it immediately after accessing the True Power for the first time. Thus it is likely that there is no technical difference between creating a weave with the True Power versus the One Power.

   spread across one's entire eyes to color them completely black, at which point it is believed that the channeler would become totally and irreversibly insane. These flecks move across the eyes in greater quantities and with greater speed when one draws more deeply on the Power. For this reason, the Forsaken use the True Power extremely sparingly and in very small amounts, and they tend not to use it for tasks that can be performed with the One Power. The sole exception to this is Moridin, who wields the True Power to the apparent exclusion of the One Power and in phenomenal amounts. Why he is willing and/or allowed to do this appears to be a combination of his status as the Dark One's favorite servant, and the fact that he seems to be insane already. As such, the negative effects of the True Power on his mind are mostly negated.

   . It has been speculated that the appearances of Ishamael's mouth and eyes, which were replaced by yellow-green flame at times, may have been a result of overuse of the True Power. It is also very likely that the reason for Ishamael's body decaying as rapidly as it did after death was due to the effects of the True Power. When

   appearing. It is however, worth noting that Moridin, despite having been given a fresh body with an undamaged/uncorrupted brain, was already far more insane upon his rebirth than he had ever been as Ishamael. Thus it is not known for certain how much of his madness can be blamed on overuse of the True Power versus the other factors that may have been responsible for it.
