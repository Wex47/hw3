  </h2>
  <p key="a6af4f3b-ad26-477d-a2b0-1aac122137c4">
   The Prime rules were:
  </p>
  <p key="6cdfbae6-9919-41b6-8aee-38ca464272ed">
   1) All Kinswomen, even the Eldest, are subject to the Rule.
  </p>
  <p key="01789786-fce5-49e5-9d28-450caa56fa3a">
   2) All Kinswomen obey any order of the Eldest and of the Knitting Circle.
  </p>
  <p key="a7758900-e25c-4b5f-9133-7ce8f3f9c3c9">
   3) The existence of the Kin must be kept secret from all who are not Kinswomen.
  </p>
  <p key="4b3d50e8-eaf5-49f4-a2b5-462bf56c0f21">
   4) It was forbidden to claim to be Aes Sedai, or to do anything that, under any circumstances, would cause someone to believe that one was Aes Sedai.
  </p>
  <p key="f650d80f-a412-4e9e-8cb0-efdcbcd29303">
   5) It was forbidden to attempt to learn more of the One Power, or to try to increase one's strength, skills and abilities beyond the level they were upon leaving the White Tower.
  </p>
  <p key="70a0c06d-dbfe-4d19-bcb4-368a30312271">
   6) It was forbidden to use the One Power outside of carefully defined circumstances, or at great need. Anyone violating this rule would be brought before a court and receive severe punishment if found guilty.
  </p>
  <p key="1bd8a27a-e3b9-488f-8c64-c81cc95c5a01">
   7) It was forbidden for anyone except the Knitting Circle, or those named by the Knitting circle, to recruit other women put out of the White Tower or who had run away. Nobody could recruit any woman who could channel except those who had once been in the Tower.
  </p>
  <p key="b17ec48d-e645-48f1-be58-a4b0352e11a1">
   What kept the Eldest from changing the rules was the simple fact that it was forbidden to change the Rule.
  </p>
  <p key="eeee2eb4-5d49-4458-9ec5-127b51f79331">
   Most of the Kin's members were put out of the White Tower for one reason or another, the vast majority for being too weak to advance to superior levels, some for failing one of the many required tests, some for insuperable discipline problems and very, very few are runaways. The Kin did try to avoid women put out for being too disruptive or who were put out for crimes such as habitual theft.

   (i.e. no Tower training) are not admitted. Young girls with the

  </p>
  <p key="b4678258-4830-4a98-808d-0b05c00db3f3">
   The Kin had a few women in Tar Valon, called guides, who cautiously checked out women expelled from the Tower. They kept a low profile and were changed at regular intervals. The guides focused on finding runaways; they would turn in those who seemed to need more training, while helping others escape. Most successful runaways were aided by the Kin. Of women put out of the Tower, the Kin approached only when sure of acceptance; they would rather miss some recruits than draw attention from the Tower.
  </p>
  <p key="ef8a1f95-d91f-4ccd-9b26-100004741e40">
   There were other rules besides these. The Kin do not allow marriage, and relationships with men are forbidden while in training. Impatience and hotheadedness were punishable. It was forbidden to speak of returning to the Tower, or to speak of recruiting girls who could be taught to channel.
  </p>
  <p key="9ad69456-45c0-4b11-9edd-4df498aa4300">
   These rules were crafted to prevent Aes Sedai from learning about the Kin; indeed, the Kin were unaware that the Aes Sedai already knew about their existence, though the Aes Sedai had severely underestimated their number, ages and organization.
  </p>
  <p key="d114db31-0ce0-4254-ae70-7a73b8c0445c">
   None of the Kin's women were

    Aes Sedai
   </a>
   , but having trained in the Tower for a while, they have some similar rules and are not exactly wilders. Rank among the Kin is determined by age, not strength in the Power. This is because the Kin tried to pattern their rules and heirarchy (except those related to keeping secret) after what they believed to be Aes Sedai rules; but because none of them had been Aes Sedai, their rules were similar to what Accepted and novices were held to. Punishments were often physical in nature, or involving labor. They were very strict about behavior.

   . Therefore there are some Kinswomen, older than Aes Sedai, between three and five hundred years old, that showed great skills and capacities in some cases better than Aes Sedai themselves.

   In fact it was recently discovered that because the Kin do not use the

   after she was told by
   Vandene Namelle
   , the Kin believed their existence was unknown by Aes Sedai that actually used them to locate runaways. This way, the capture rate of women who fled the White Tower was significantly improved, catching 90% of all runaways.

   Any Kinswomen is allowed to stay in Ebou Dar (or any other place) for no more than ten years, so no one can notice that she doesn’t age. Then she is sent far away, employed in some craft or as a merchant; she can return to a previous place only after more than twenty years have passed, as it is assumed no one would easily recognize her any longer. As part of their need for discretion, they will often take many names, trades, and jobs over the course of their lives.

  <p key="3490c703-9bc1-4cc1-8d72-638b13827586">
   The Kin does not allow its members in Ebou Dar to reach the number of two hundred, a number considered too much noticeable by the White Tower. So they are turned frequently to and from other places, using the Farm as a cover to pass through.

   The Aes Sedai discovered the organization quite quickly, but their involvement in the Trolloc Wars stopped them to intervene immediately to disperse the Kin. Later for the Sisters became convenient that the Kin, so discreet, took care for the channelers that failed to become Aes Sedai. Also, as stated above, the Kin revealed to be very useful to catch runaways, so finally the White Tower decided to not intervene against it.
  </p>
  <p key="e2a25edb-dc6b-4c52-b3be-cf57d347f9af">
   During the centuries the Kin became the refuge for many hundreds of female channelers, finally gathering more channelers than the Tower itself. In fact its discretion, its ability to hide the Kinswomen by organizing a rapid turn over of people from the same place, left the Aes Sedai completely unaware of its real dimension.

   Sedai asked Reanne Corly how many Kinswomen there are all together. Reanne answered that they are one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three (1,783) names on the roll. The Aes Sedai present were shocked for this large number, because the Kin is almost twice as many as their total number. Reanne mistook their silence and thought that it was too few a number.

   The average strength in the One Power among the Kinswomen is very low if confronted to that of the average Aes Sedai, in fact the Kin is formed in majority by ex-novices too weak to reach not only the Shawl, but even to be tested for Accepted.

This contract was not considered well by the Amyrlin Seat and the Hall of the Tower, but the upcoming of the Last Battle stopped them to take a measure about it.
