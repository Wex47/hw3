   Canluum

   in size. Despite being neither built by Ogier nor founded on the site of a city built by Ogier, Chachin holds its fair share of ancient relics; foremostly the documents named

   Shol Arbela
   , lay within the borders of

   The city is built around several hills with three tall mountains rising out of the center. The
   Aesdaishar Palace
   , the seat of the ruler of Kandor, currently Queen
   Ethenielle Cosaru Noramaga
   , is located atop the highest mountain, which rises over 5,000 feet over the city below. Three tall ringwalls encircle the city with a 100-foot-wide drymoat located beyond that. Twenty-four bridges cross the moat, each overlooked by a small fortress where the bridge meets the city. The Bridge of Sunrise is located on the eastern side of the city, where the road from Canluum enters the city.

   As with many Borderland cities, Chachin is mostly made of stone buildings with glazed tile roofs that are more difficult to burn in a sneak attack. The poorest districts are nearest the edge of the city, within the first ringwall, with the districts becoming richer and more prosperous the closer a traveler comes to the central mountains.

  <p key="604ecdcb-d085-4d7c-851d-b4beb69e575a">
   The city is also the home of the Merchants' Guild of Kandor. These merchants can easily be recognized by the chains going across the front of their coats.
