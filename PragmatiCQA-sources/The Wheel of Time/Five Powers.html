    Experiencing the Flows

   Sensing the flows of the Power is, at best, described inaccurately to those who cannot channel. Even saying one can "feel" the flows is misleading, as it is not a physical feeling. However it is perceived, each of the Five Powers is distinct and distinguishable by channelers. It could be said that each element has a different flavor or character.
  </p>
  <p key="7ccfc006-fae0-4733-8c15-cf69c98d7462">
   Channelers will describe the experience of "seeing" the flows visually, despite the non-visible nature of the flows. Seeing the flows take shape into weaves is how one learns and memorizes the techniques of manipulating the Power. The flows appear smooth and nearly transparent, faintly tinged with color according to which of the Five Powers is involved. Fire appears red, Water appears blue, Earth appears green, Air appears yellow, and Spirit appears white.
  </p>
  <p key="f7411d1d-b941-46ff-8659-5656b70e3f73">
   The strength of a flow is evident to a channeler by its size, be it a trickle of power or cable-thick strands. Again, this is a misleading way of describing it to non-channelers, as very thin strands can be quite fine and powerful while thicker ones less forceful. These flows appear to emanate from the body of the channeler, except to the channeler him or herself. To the person channeling, the flow appears to originate in close proximity.
