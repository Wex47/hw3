   is most concentrated here; any who dared channel it would be instantly incinerated. This is the only place on Earth where the Dark One can directly communicate with those within the Pattern. The Dark One is also capable of altering time and reality in this place, and it appears that the Dragon, Rand al'Thor, can counteract this tampering. The Dark One's control of reality in this place makes certain things, like creating
   Mindtraps
   , possible, where they would be impossible anywhere else. During the Last Battle, the lake of lava was consumed by a tiny portion of the Dark One's essence that he managed to spawn into the Pattern, leaving it empty and dark.

   Shayol Ghul may be a parallel to
