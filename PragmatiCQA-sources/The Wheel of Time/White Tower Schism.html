   Later it was revealed that five of those sitters had originally been sent by their Ajahs. The Heads of the five "unaligned" (i.e., not Blue or Red) Ajahs met and decided to send one Sitter per Ajah to help guide the rebels toward reconciliation:

   In their places, the Heads directly appointed themselves or women younger than what was usual for a woman to hold a chair in the Hall. These replacements were only meant to serve for a short period—presumably until the five Sitters returned.

   There were two other pre-split Sitters who were not invited to the vote to depose Siuan.
   Janya
   (Brown) left on her own out of disgust at the illegality;

    Seaine

   (White) was not instructed to leave, and decided to stay to keep the Tower whole. It is likely that Seaine was not sent so that each unaligned Ajah would have exactly representative in Salidar. This may be why Janya's replacement,
   Shevan
   , was not an unusual choice, as Janya may have been seen as a geunuine rebel.

   In Salidar, the five Sitters found a rebellion led by Sheriam and
   five other women
   that was better organized than the Ajah Heads had anticipated. They divided into factions meant to keep the Hall paralyzed by playing

   against one another (Faiselle and Takima joined Lelaine, while Magla, Saroiya and Varilin joined Romanda). By the time the schism healed, Ajah Head
   Jesse Bilal
   believed some of the five Sitters had come to side with the rebels more often than the Tower. Indeed, many of them believed the rumors about the Reds setting up Logain as a false dragon, making it difficult for them to continue defusing the rebellion as their personal beliefs conflicted with it. However, the five were consistent in opposing Egwene's motions and pushing for negotiations with the Tower.

   Aside from the five Sitters sent by the Ajah Heads, the Blues, and Janya, the rebel Sitters were too young or otherwise unusual. Among the Sitters chosen in Salidar, only Romanda and Moria were not really unusual.

    because of

   her previous experience (former Sitter and Yellow Ajah Head). The five Sitters seemed to have been responsible for choosing the Too Young Sitters from their Ajahs; Romanda thinks that Magla had insisted on
   Salita Toranes
   for the Yellow, though even Magla did not dare oppose Romanda's raising as a Sitter. However; this tactic may have backfired as the young Sitters generally
   voted as a bloc
   in favor of Egwene's proposals and other decisive action such as declaring war against Elaida. In fact, the five Sitters sent from Tar Valon generally found themselves virtually alone on the losing end of votes.

   . Elaida was captured and the White Tower reunified under rebel Amyrlin Egwene al'Vere. The pre-split Sitters who fled the Tower all regained their seats in the Hall, in most cases displacing the Too Young Sitters or taking seats vacated by Black Ajah members. In fact, the Brown Ajah returned all three pre-split Sitters to the Hall upon reunification as none had been Black.
