   joined the fight. Hawkwing defeated them as well. Over the next nineteen years Hawkwing conquered the entire continent, sparing only the city of Tar Valon and its surrounding territory. His final victory came in
   FY 963
   with the defeat of Aldeshar and the surrender of its king,
   Joal Ramedar
   . In a surprising move, as Hawkwing was famed for his leniency and mercy towards honorable foes, he had Ramedar executed, claiming that he had a hand in the murder of his first wife,
   Amaline Tagora
   , and their two surviving children two years earlier. He also had Ramedar's heirs and family stripped of all their titles and scattered across the land. This is known as the
   Black Years
   of his reign.

  <p key="4dc27da8-a150-42f4-bce1-c37c4bbedfd6">

   , only fragmentary records remain of how the Empire was organized. We know the Empire was split into numerous provinces, each under the control of an Imperial Governor appointed by Hawkwing. Hawkwing used former rulers or the heirs of those rulers of the preexisting kingdoms where he felt they were suitable, but to prevent them building up power bases and rebelling, he would transfer them to remote parts of the continent from their homeland (with the sole exception of Endara Casalain). To this end he also appears to have changed the borders and names of the provinces to prevent a resurgence of nationalist feeling within those lands.

   in the
   Caralain Grass
   , a site selected for its central location with respect to the rest of the Empire, its lack of preexisting historical ties and symbolism, and the barrier that prevented usage of the One Power. However, construction of the capital never advanced beyond the completion of a great statue of Hawkwing, and that was pulled down soon after his death.
  </p>
  <p key="e61feb24-8eb6-4533-8df3-1e5ccdeca874">
   Under the High King in the Empire's hierarchy were the Imperial Governors. Each governor had responsibility for a huge territory and sometimes vast populations, granting them power equal to one of the former kings or queens. The major difference was that Hawkwing promoted strictly by merit. Nobles had to prove their worth to rule as governors as they did in the military, and it was not unknown for commoners of exceptional ability to rise to these high positions.
  </p>
  <p key="1a2c6609-0cd9-45dc-84a0-f185e1eba4f9">
   After Hawkwing restored friendly relations with Tar Valon, he increasingly came to rely on Aes Sedai administrators and governors, mainly due to their lack of corruptibility compared to others. By
   FY 973
   over one-third of the high administrative offices in the Empire, including the governorships, were held by Aes Sedai. However, some claimed that these Aes Sedai were more loyal to the Amyrlin Seat than the High King.
  </p>
  <p key="c429305b-f8be-45a2-88de-6f9ea75fb2e8">
   During this time Hawkwing also sponsored many great public works, such as the building or rebuilding of many major roads, the construction of new towns and fortresses, and the establishing of militias ("circuit rovers") and police forces (the "Civil Guard") to reduce crime and banditry within the cities and on the roads.

   The Empire, consisting as it did of all the military forces of the former kingdoms combined, possessed vast manpower stretching into many hundreds of thousands of troops. Hawkwing, as befitting the greatest military commander in history, kept his armies well-trained and motivated even in times of peace. He rotated military formations through different provinces to ensure their freshness, and promoted strictly by merit.

   . The invasion was aborted after several months due to severe losses to the Aiel guerrilla tactics and their refusal to engage in an open field battle, as well as the harsh climate and terrain. Relations between the west and the Aiel do not appear to have improved much beyond this time.

However, in FY 993 Hawkwing attempted an invasion of Shara by sea, through an army led by one of his daughters. The invasion was defeated and the army and fleet destroyed.

   Following the murder of his wife and children in
   FY 961
   , Hawkwing entered a period called the
   Black Years
   , a time of anger and depression when he made many questionable decisions, including the hasty and ill-thought-out invasion of the Aiel Waste. Upon his return from the Waste, he met and fell in love with a young woman named
   Tamika
   , who became his second wife and lifted him from the gloom of the Black Years, giving him several more children including Luthair and
   Laiwynde

   In
   FY 973
   , a man named
   Jalwin Moerad
   arrived at Hawkwing's court and rapidly won the ear of the High King, despite reports of unorthodox and unstable behavior. Known for having a strong contempt of Aes Sedai, he quickly became Hawkwing's closest adviser, and in
   FY 974
   Hawkwing abruptly dismissed all Aes Sedai from posts within the Empire. The following year, Hawkwing's armies overran Tar Valon's territory and laid siege to the city, a siege that would last the remainder of Hawkwing's life. The reasons for this sudden collapse of relations are unknown, although many conspiracy theories have been present. One of the most plausible is that Moerad presented the High King with evidence that it was Bonwhin who had ordered the deaths of Amaline and their children, but this remains pure supposition.

   Battle of Talidar
   in early
   FY 987
   and utterly crushed them. Emboldened by his victory, and possibly wishing to busy himself with work after the death of Tamika the same year, Hawkwing began massive planning and in
   FY 989
   , two immense fleets began construction at the western and southern ports. He began a recruitment drive to assemble no less than 600,000 soldiers and settlers to dispatch on two expeditions across the oceans. In FY 992 he dispatched the first fleet from the western ports under his son Luthair, with orders to land in and subjugate the Seanchan continent. The following year, one of his daughters led another fleet from the southern ports to Shara, but this army was apparently destroyed and Sea Folk reported that the the fleet had been burned at anchor in the landing harbors.

   While few thought much of it at the time, it became known in later years that, while this chaos was consuming Hawkwing's empire, Jalwin Moerad vanished abruptly and without a trace. It also became known in later years that Moerad had remained in the kingdom for exactly forty years, and that he had never appeared to age a single day in all that time. These oddities led Aran son of Malan son of Senar, a post-Breaking historian, to theorize that Moerad had in fact the

   , and that many of Hawkwing's more questionable decisions could be traced to his counsel. These decisions included Hawkwing's sudden about-face on his relations with Tar Valon, the invasions of Seanchan and Shara, and his refusal of Aes Sedai healing that led to his death. Additionally, he also speculated that Moerad was behind the sudden deaths of the rest of Hawkwing's family and the three most likely extra-familial contenders for the throne, in order to see to it that the High King had no obvious heirs. All of these events, Aran concluded, were part of a plan by Moerad/Ishamael to destabilize and ultimately destroy Hawkwing's empire, the existence of which had greatly stabilized the Westlands.

   Hawkwing's remarkable success in unifying all the lands under one rule, and his belief in universal suffrage and equality, proved extremely unpopular with the nobility. During the War of the Hundred Years every statue and memorial to him, and almost every book which mentioned his name, was destroyed. A huge statue to him located on what is now
   Caralain Grass
   was pulled down and demolished. In many areas even mentioning his name was a crime. However, the people remembered and Hawkwing's name continued to be mentioned with honor even a thousand years later. The claim that Hawkwing's grandson Tyrn actually survived and rose to rule in the city of
