   Most people today are not as dedicated to the Dark One as they were when the Bore was open, although some are still as zealous today. Many people just want to dabble in something taboo and do not realize that their vows hold them unto death (and sometimes beyond it). There are enough of them in number to be dangerous, however; a city of one hundred thousand may contain five hundred to one thousand Darkfriends, roughly 0.5% to 1% of the population.

   It is not made clear how exactly such a vast network of Darkfriends is completely organized. In almost all cases the only thing that any of the Darkfriends have in common with each other is that they worship the Lord of the Grave. From the highest to the lowest there are Darkfriends, although rank in the regular world means nothing - Darkfriends have their own internal hierarchy and a king or Aes Sedai would have to obey the lowest beggar if they stood higher than them and gave the correct signs (for example, there was a Darkfriend beggar in

   Some Darkfriend circles and individuals, such as
   Liandrin's group of Black Sisters
   and Jaichim Carridin, have found themselves being given conflicting orders by different members of the Chosen, putting them in a difficult position as they would not hesitate to kill them for disobedience or failure.

  <p key="53f72209-0092-4be9-8c62-61003acc933f">
   The Wheel of Time Companion reveals that there was no overall command structure. Darkfriends were organized in cells, which contended with one another; each organization has its own internal structure and hierarchy. Some individuals operated alone; these were usually not accepted in any cell due to indiscretions or similar reasons.

   In most cases, to become a Darkfriend you must be noticed by another Darkfriend. Darkfriends are always on the lookout for new recruits to raise their numbers. A cell of Darkfriends might watch people in public and see how they react, and if they think that someone shows signs of being a possible candidate they will approach them. Often they kill people who refuse to stay hidden. All that said, if someone wishes to become a Darkfriend they can speak against "The Light" trying to be subtle, although that runs the risk of being caught.
