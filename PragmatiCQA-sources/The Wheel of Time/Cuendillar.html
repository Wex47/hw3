   Though the actual making of Power Wrought weapons is forbidden, it is curious to note that after the rediscovery of
   <i key="a9561d21-bcaf-4f38-a7e7-951ea09f3eb4">
    cuendillar
   </i>
   , the weave was not used on the weapons and armor of the forces of the Light against the Shadow. Since the weapon is already made, the Oath concerning the making of weapons is bypassed and the Aes Sedai are merely altering is physical properties, therefore not creating a weapon in its entirety. Perhaps this is due to the conception that examples of
   <i key="b8e5c7d0-4f4c-4e91-a4cd-3b2db6cb33d3">
    cuendillar
   </i>
   are primarily pieces of art or tableware.

   <i key="0fd34a14-6ed9-49f5-807f-ed60c87f3aaa">

   weave on armor and weaponry are staggering. (If cuendillar must be made from iron its weight and thickness would still be a factor.)
  </p>
  <p key="a4fccdc9-4664-47b5-8d93-9058f5e37289">
   Armor could be paper thin and weigh next to nothing allowing suits of armor that cover the entire body apart from eye slots without over-encumbering its wearer, impenetrable to armor-piercing weaponry. There would be few practical ways to kill a soldier in this armor. Striking through the facial spaces or hitting the armor with enough force for inertia to damage its occupant are the most common ways for a non-Power user to defeat their opponent.
  </p>
  <p key="5d77b02e-c602-4c53-a10c-87ee0e8a0910">
   Siege warfare would no longer be able to utilize battering rams, catapults or trebuchets to damage walls or gates.
  </p>
  <p key="b33412c6-73d8-44bb-9e85-2d1e323eddd3">
   Weapons would never need sharpening, repairing or oiling. Hafts for polearms could be thin pipe extrusions instead of wood, thereby granting better blocking capability and mobility due to lower weight. Dragons (cannons) would be many times lighter, allowing for hand-held versions.
  </p>
  <p key="35b5e6b2-889c-4c80-b82a-b40543e39868">
   If the Aes Sedai had altered weapons for the Last Battle, they would probably still insist on disposing of them after it is over via dumping them off the edge of the Ways or Gateways because they could be construed as power-wrought weapons whose only purpose would be to kill men, the shadowspawn having been exterminated.

   The first broken seal found in the Eye of the World remained hard as in its material. When Lan tried to break one piece even more, he broke a good knife of the best steel from Tear but the piece remained unharmed.
   This might indicate that it was broken by the True Power. 
Seals found later were not broken but one could slice off pieces of them with a knife.
   The last three were broken by Logain in the Last Battle and he simply used his hand to break them.
