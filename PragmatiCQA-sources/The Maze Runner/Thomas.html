     takes him to a chair, then injects a pain stimulator into Stephen's neck. Stephen tries to stay with his old name, but, at the touch of a button, Randall activates the Stimulator, causing excruciating pain. Seconds after the first wave of pain, Stephen wakes up, strapped with leather to the chair. Randall is in front of him with the button, Stephen starts to cry, and then Randall presses the button. This happens several times, after four waves of pain, Stephen gets used to the torture's never-ending pain. Stephen tries to fake accepting his new name. Randall then responds saying "I don't believe you." and presses the button, causing more and more pain. Randall then continuously asks Stephen his name. Giving up hope, he responds with 'Thomas' and accepts his new name. Randall administers a final wave of torture to remind Stephen (now Thomas) that he can always inject a new stimulator if he even mentions his old name. After this, Thomas does not see Randall for years, which he is thankful for, as he hated him.

At night, just as the walls begin to close, Thomas sees Minho dragging an unconscious Alby towards the Glade; the Griever had been playing dead and Alby had been stung. Thomas wants to go and help and, ignoring the rules, dashes into the Maze right before the walls close. Minho is angry at Thomas for doing something so pointless, as he believes all three of them will die. At the sound of Grievers in the distance, Minho leaves Alby and Thomas and runs off, believing their chances will be better if they split up. Thomas drags Alby to the wall and starts tying him to the vines, working him higher and higher above the ground. When a Griever finally appears, Thomas lures it away from Alby by running deeper into the Maze. When he finds himself surrounded by several Grievers, he runs away and then, turning around, he leaps over the one chasing him before it can slow its momentum.

They both stand at the edge of the Cliff, and when the Grievers charge at them, they jump away and the Grievers fall over the edge. Several feet beyond the Cliff, there is an invisible hole seemingly suspended in mid-air, which is where the Grievers usually return after roaming the Maze.

     At nightfall, Gally brings Thomas to the Pit. Chuck appears and talks to him, confiding in him how he longs for his parents. Chuck is convinced that Thomas will finally make it out of the Maze and he gives Thomas a small figurine as a lucky charm and asks him to tell his parents that he loves them. But Thomas refuses and insists that Chuck will tell them himself.

     That night, the doors do not close, and the Grievers attack the Gladers. Alby saves Chuck's life by hacking off a Griever's limb, only to be killed seconds later. Many Gladers are killed in that night. When the attack is over, Thomas stabs himself in the thigh with the hacked off Griever sting, hoping that he will regain some memory to help them finally escape. In his memory dream, he can see himself working beside Teresa for WCKD, experimenting on his friends. Thomas wakes up in the Pit, afflicted by feels of guilt. Newt tells him that none of the past matters any more. The only thing that matters is who they are now and what they do now.

But Thomas knocks out his capturers, his friends free Teresa, and two parties form. Thomas, Teresa, Newt and Minho are determined to go for the Griever Hole and find the exit.

    Gally, who is stung by a Griever, appears with a gun, telling them that they will never be free. He points the gun at Thomas, but Minho throws a spear at Gally, impaling him in the chest, while Gally shoots a bullet at Chuck, hitting him in the chest. While the Gladers cry in shock over Chuck's dead body, masked and armed men arrive and usher them to a waiting helicopter, telling them that they are safe now.

When Thomas asks when the Flare will stop, Teresa replies that it stops when WCKD finds a cure. Thomas replies that there is no cure. Janson holds them at gunpoint, but Teresa manages to let Thomas and Newt go to find Minho while she goes to do a blood test on Thomas' blood.

     Thomas and Newt reunite with Minho and they and him escape from Janson and the WCKD soldiers. Thomas, Newt, and Minho manage to lock themselves in a room. Thomas and Minho manage to break the window and they and Newt jump out of the window and into the pool. When they get out of the pool, four masked soldiers approach them and tell them to surrender, but one of them shoots the other three, takes off his helmet, and reveals himself to be Gally. Minho is shocked to see that Gally is alive, and Gally tells him, Thomas, and Newt that they are nuts.

Janson reveals to Thomas that he has been infected by the Flare and plans to inject the serum with Thomas' blood into his arm, causing Teresa to hit Janson in the head with a glass flask, knocking him unconscious. Teresa tries to release Thomas, but Janson regains consciousness and knocks Teresa down. Thomas frees himself and engages Janson in a fight, but Janson overpowers him and prepares to shoot him, when Lawrence's crew fires a missile at the WCKD Tower, knocking Thomas, Teresa, and Janson down. Teresa carries Thomas to the medical wing, but not before Janson shoots Thomas in the stomach. Teresa offers to give Janson the serum containing Thomas' blood, but Janson refuses and wants Thomas himself. Thomas throws a very heavy object at a glass front, allowing the Cranks that are locked inside it to break out and attack Janson. Teresa carries Thomas to the roof, gives him the serum containing his blood, and kisses him. Minho, Gally, Frypan, Brenda, Jorge, Vince, and the Immune teenagers arrive in a berg. Thomas is unable to get on the berg due to his wound, but Teresa throws him onto the berg, allowing Minho, Gally, Frypan, Brenda, and Vince to pull him aboard. Teresa falls to her death when the WCKD Tower collapses. As Jorge flies Thomas, Minho, Gally, Frypan, Brenda, Vince, and the Immune teenagers away from the tower, Gally administers a bandage on Thomas' wound.

    Minho gives Thomas Newt's necklace, which Thomas discovers contains a note from Newt. Thomas reads the note, in which Newt tells him to look after everyone, before thanking Thomas for being his friend. Thomas approaches Minho, Gally, Frypan, Aris, Brenda, Jorge, Vince, Sonya, Harriet, the Right Arm, and the Immune teenagers at the campfire, hugs Gally and Brenda, and sits down with them, Minho, Frypan, Aris, Jorge, Vince, Sonya, Harriet, the Right Arm, and the Immune teenagers at the campfire. The next day, Thomas goes to the
    Memorial Rock
    and carves Teresa's name on it. Thomas walks along the beach, stops walking, looks at the ocean and the ship, takes out the serum, looks at it, and looks out into the distance.
