   Kaya Scodelario was born Kaya Rose Humphrey on March 13, 1992 in Haywards Heath, West Sussex. Her mother, Katia Scodelario, is a Brazilian from Itu, São Paulo, who moved to England in 1990; Scodelario's surname comes from her mother's Italian grandfather. Her father, Roger Humphrey (died 22 November 2010), was British. Scodelario's parents divorced when she was a child and she was raised in London by her mother, subsequently adopting her surname and becoming fluent in Portuguese.

   In 2007, at the age of 14 and with no acting experience, Scodelario was cast in the first series of
   <i key="efd9b60a-62fe-4bd0-a93c-212691cbd14e">
    Skins
   </i>
   as Effy Stonem. At the auditions, Scodelario became discouraged as she felt she was too young, but a producer told her to stay and she was asked to read for the part. While Scodelario's role in the first series had minimal speaking lines, her character developed considerably during 2008. She eventually became the central character in the 2009 and 2010 series after the cast had been replaced with a new generation of characters. This made Effy one of the only characters to appear from series 1 right through to series 4 of Skins. Filming began in July and Scodelario said that 18 November 2009 was her last day of filming the series and that she would miss being on the show.

  <p key="e82a92de-ffe7-4b60-b76c-d0f67e222ad5">
   Scodelario left after the fourth series, making way for the third generation of characters. Her performance was praised by critics, and she was nominated twice for Best Actress at the TV Quick Awards, in 2009 and 2010. In the episode "Fire", one of three parts of the seventh (and final) season of

   , Scodelario reprised the role of Effy. It is a two-part depiction of her life as an adult, lasting two hours. She claims "Fire" is "more like a movie" and that she could relate to Effy's struggle to change from a teenager into an adult.
