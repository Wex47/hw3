This is speculated to be the voice of Chancellor Ava Paige and that she is the one who left the room after waking Thomas, who sees a door close as his eyes adjust to the light. Shortly after, Thomas finds a manila folder with a name in big red letters on the front. Inside, there is a map of the

     are over. She says there is more than enough data to create a blueprint but that her associates disagree with her. Paige states that she was able to stop the procedure they were going to carry out on Thomas and saved his life. She says that WICKED will continue trying to find a cure with the data and that the subjects' participation is no longer required. She continues, saying that there is a back door in the building and she wants Thomas, his friends, and the rest of the

     that will transport them to what she hopes "will be a new life." The note ends with her saying to "take them all and leave."

    In the epilogue, Paige sends her associates a final message saying that they have failed, but they have also succeeded. She says the original plan never came together and they were not able to finish the blueprint or create a

Paige says she hopes that over the years they have been able to pay part of the price of the "unspeakable act committed against humanity" by those before them who released the Flare into the world. Towards the end of her message, she states that she doesn't know how history will judge the actions of

    , but that they only ever had one goal: preserve the human race. Paige says that with this last act, that is exactly what they have done. She ends the message by repeating that WICKED is good.

   Although she does not make a personal appearance in the first three books, she is still revealed to be exceptionally intelligent, charismatic, and resourceful. She's also extremely adaptive and is capable of manipulating any change in plans to the advantage of her goals, to such an extent where they benefit her plans directly. She is a utilitarian, and when

   's attempts at finding a cure fail, she abandons them to put into place a backdoor to save the human race (alternatively, one could say that it's the rest of the WICKED employees who abandoned her and WICKED's original goals of saving the world, to keep their organization alive). She is also shown to be much more kind than her movie counterpart, and was said by Thomas in The Fever Code that she was 'the only doctor who seemed to have a heart'.

   that she is willing to fake her death to support its aims. She is somewhat delusional and does not believe that the things she and her organization are doing are completely necessary, and any negative results are inevitable or necessary. Despite the genocidal results of her experiments, Paige believes that her conscience is clean. She has virtually no remorse or guilt in the cruelty of her experiments, or horrors she puts her test subjects through, and believes everything she and her cohorts do is for the greater good, justifying her depravities that her methods are merely a means to an end. She believes that no cost is too great to successfully manufacture a cure for the Flare Virus, and will allow for nothing and no one to stand in the way of that, as she allowed

   right after claiming her conscience to be clear. This is very different from how she was portrayed in the books. Perhaps a small part of Paige does regret her actions as she wanted for the children Janson to harvest from to feel no pain. Even so, it's small enough not to stop her from her hypocrisies.

    "Well, I think it's safe to say the Maze Trials were a complete success. I wasn't expecting so many survivors, but the more the merrier. Thomas continues to surprise and impress. And for now, they seem to have taken the bait. It's too soon to say, but they could be the key to everything. So let's move forward. It's time now to begin Phase Two."
