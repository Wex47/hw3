   The Denver Crank Palace was set up like a town, with huts built along streets surrounding the open center of the compound. Cranks at varying stages of the Flare roamed freely, and the guards were nervous. There seemed to have been some attempt made to give the inmates entertainment, as Thomas and the others found Newt in a dilapidated bowling alley. While walking through the Crank Palace, a guard told them that putting glass in the building windows had been a huge mistake when it became a source of weaponry. This was added to when Thomas, Minho, Brenda, and Jorge encountered a Crank wielding a long shard of glass.
