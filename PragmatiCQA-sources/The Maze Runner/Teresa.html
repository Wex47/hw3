   Teresa was extremely intelligent and smart; she was capable of finding a cure in the movie, and in The Fever Code, technologies were her area of expertise. She is also very caring because she tried to do whatever it takes to save Thomas, even when it meant her death. Sacrificing herself in both the movie and the book required a great deal of bravery.

I thought she'd get better. Every night, she'd make these awful sounds, like screaming. And then, one night, she just stopped. She was finally quiet. I went down to her room.
