This is not a variable and i'm not lying to you.". The opration would be painless, but it would result in Thomas' death. The only thing that saves Thomas is WICKED Chancellor

    In the part titled 'Minho, Phase 3 trial', Janson is encountered once, the only time he's encountered in the entire book. Janson turns up at Minho's door with two armed guards. When challenged, he orders, "Follow me or you'll be fired upon.". He escorts Minho into his room- Room #8. When questioned, Janson explains that, inside the room, Minho will have to undergo the third phase of the Trials. He states that it is "The easiest [and shortest] of all the tests" that WICKED have created. He then states that Minho's answer will "consist of exactly one word". Minho doesn't trust Janson and tells him to his face, calling the man a "shuck-face". Janson then says that Minho's "response alone will dictate what happens.", and that, "Everything from this point is voluntary. The Trials are over.". Janson leaves.

Janson draws his gun, proclaiming that it is a waste to spill Thomas' precious blood. He intends to shoot Thomas, who is saved by Brenda, who shoots Janson in the shoulder and provides Thomas with cover while he runs away. Wounded, Janson returns to the berg and is carried away with Paige, Teresa, and the remaining WCKD soldiers.

She undoes one of Thomas' straps, but Janson regains consciousness and attacks her. He is desperate and fights for the Cure- eventually getting it after smashing her head onto one of the tables. Thomas quickly gets the other strap undone, and tackles Janson through a glass pane. The two of them fight viciously in the corridor until Janson stands up and points his gun at Thomas. Suddenly, two rockets hit the building and Janson falls over amongst the explosion and fire. Thomas uses the opportunity to stand up. He and Teresa grab the serum and run. Janson shoots at them as they sprint down the hallway. Thomas and Teresa hide in a testing room, where it is revealed that Thomas has been shot in the stomach.
