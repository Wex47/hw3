   , another Icer, proposes that they simply abandon Aris to the Maze and let the Shades, Group B's equivalent of Grievers, take him. Rachel and Alexandra quickly get into a heated argument over the morality of leaving Aris to die in the Maze. Before it can escalate further, Aris interjects, much to their chagrin.

  <p key="fa531ed6-f03b-454c-b94a-1dc55d651383">
   Aris states that neither side is wrong in what they say. Ximena is right to not trust him over who he is. Rachel is also right in that he is not a spy and, like the girls, does not know why he is here. He nevertheless states that he is willing to assist the girls in finding a way out. The short speech earns the support of the Icers in allowing Aris to join them. Immediately afterward, Ximena punches Aris square in the face, stating that it is the most effective way of helping Aris remember his name, to which he tells them.

   Sometime later, all the Icers, including Aris, head out into the Maze. Once they reach the vertical portion of the Maze, they begin the strenuous work of ice climbing it. As the girls ascend, they make note it is the farthest up they have ever been in their time in the Maze as well as the fact that no Shades have appeared. Before the group can ascend further up, a Shade attacks the group, killing Ximena and severely injuring Rachel.

   As Rachel recovers from her fall, Aris discovers that there is a Maze pattern on the wings of the Shade hanged up in the hut surrounding the Decision Tree. Using their time out of the Maze, the two work together on examining the patterns and drawing it out on paper. Meanwhile, the able-bodied Icers continue to head out into the Maze, suffering additional losses as the Shades grow bolder in their attacks. One day, Aris decides to cut open the Shade and discovers a transmitter buried inside it. At that same moment, the remaining Icers, led by both Harriet and Sonya, confront the pair over the actions.

   Aris explains to the rest he discovered what appears to be a transmitter, which could be a way out of the Maze. Before a vote could be made on whether or not they should activate it, Rachel presses the button hoping for the best. It instead releases Shades into the Spring. The two begin apologizing to the group for leading them into a trap, but Harriet stops them. She states that while the two didn't save them as they hope, they did finally bring an end to the nightmare of being in the Maze. The Icers quickly rally to attack the incoming Shades. As the Icers try and fight off the Shades, the transmitter turns green and
