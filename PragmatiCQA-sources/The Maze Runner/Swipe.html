Eventually they realize that they need to have the Swipes removed so WICKED can no longer control their actions (thus, they intend to only remove the part that WICKED allows to control them), so

   , an ex-WICKED scientist. When he goes to set up his machine, however, WICKED's control over Thomas kicks in. While trying to kill his friends, Thomas remembers that WICKED had implanted a fail-safe device inside his brain to prevent the control-chip's removal. After Thomas has a brief struggle with WICKED over the control of his brain (because WICKED isn't close enough for full control), he picks up a knife and attempts to kill Hans. He does because he thinks the fail-safe would make him kill whoever was trying to remove that fail-safety device inside head. It takes the other four to finally get him on the bed and drugged so Hans can remove the Swipe.
