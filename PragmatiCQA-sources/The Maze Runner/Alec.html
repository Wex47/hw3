     When Mark awakes, Alec tells him that he found Trina, Deedee and Lana in a suburban area and tells him that they're about to land a few miles off. They pack food, water and the newly acquired Transvices and depart from the Berg to retrieve their friends. They manage to shoot off a few stragglers before hearing the aching scream of Lana. Alec books it to the source of the sound and finds her, hair torn, bloody, beaten, a shadow of her former self surrounded by 3 Infected. In a fit of absolute rage, Alec begins to fire at the men surrounding her, while Mark, never having seen the man so angry, begins to shoot as well. They take them out as well as the auxiliary ones. Alec runs over to Lana, Mark following, and witnesses what they've done to her. Alec, seeing that Lana is in the greatest amount of pain, points the Transvice to her head and pulls the trigger. Mark then begins to see the affect of his partner's death on Alec.

     Alec, still emotionally sturdy, and Mark begin to search house to house for Trina and Deedee, attracting the attention of many Infected. After a few failed attempts, the two find the two girls in the basement of a mansion, huddled together. As Mark begins to escort the two girls out, a horde of Infected attack the house. In the midst of the action, Trina exclaims to Alec and Mark that they have to get Deedee to a safe place for she was immune. With a few scratches and bruises, the group make it out alive, make it back to the Berg, and launch up into the sky. Alec and Mark discuss where they should go, and both agree to get Deedee to the Flat-Trans in Asheville to get her to safety. After the conversation, both men decide to get some sleep while the Berg flies to Asheville.

    In the middle of the night, Mark finds Alec at the foot of a door and flashes a light to his face. Alec, eyes bloodshot and profusely sweating, declares that he's really sick and going to die, but swore not to while standing idle. Mark asks him if he could still make it to Ashville, to which he says yes. A few hours later, Alec, Mark, Trina and Deedee all prepare to land in the PCC base in the city, but find Bruce and his army leading a siege to destroy the FlatnTrans. Hastening, Alec lands Mark, Trina, and Deedee in front of the base and realizing that this is the last moment they'll all share, listens to Mark's last request, that no matter what happens he'll know what to do. The trio then rush into the building, while Alec ascends into the air one last time. He flies around the base and after witnessing the horror of the scene of Bruce's men taking the base, he decides that it was time. He then shifts the plane towards the PCC building and begins to soar at top speed. As Trina and Mark embrace after escorting Deedee to safety, Alec pilots the Berg into the building, detonating a massive explosion, obliterating all of them, and ultimately completing his moral mission: perish for a cause.
