     , they met a group of Cranks that came at them. Thomas found a familiar face in one of the Cranks, which was Newt's. He got out of the van and ran straight to Newt. Newt was suddenly begging for him to shoot him in the head, which was what Newt wanted based on the note that he gave Thomas, reading "
     <i key="cb411b7a-6674-4faa-b3d1-6f9eb7ba5c3a">
      Kill me. If you've ever been my friend, kill me.

     " Thomas didn't want to, but Newt kept asking him helplessly. He said he didn't want to end up losing his sanity and eat people. He told Thomas how he got his limp, jumping off a Maze wall. He tells Thomas that it was all his fault that Newt tried to kill himself and asks him to kill him to make up for all the pain he caused Newt.
    </p>
    Newt's last words were "
    <i key="91c23dcf-a649-4b4f-8679-a4fc359af16e">
     Please, Tommy. please.
    </i>
    " With a heavy heart, Thomas knew it was Newt's last wish, so he pulled the trigger and shot Newt in the head, which eventually lead to Newt's death. Thomas was shown to be deeply affected by his death, as he was described as having a numbing sadness in his body that is equivalent to the sadness he felt when Chuck was killed.
