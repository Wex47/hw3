A WICKED guard attacks Brenda, but he is overpowered by Thomas, while Teresa rescues Brenda. Jorge and Brenda disappear shortly afterwards.

     Before they could get inside a berg, a dozen WICKED guards stormed into the hangar and opened fire on Thomas and his friends. Minho told Jorge to start up a berg while they fight the guards. Jorge complied and ran off to power up a berg while Thomas, Minho, Brenda, and Newt fought the WICKED guards. The guards, unaware of the stolen weaponry Thomas and his friends possessed, were easily underestimated and quickly beaten by the Gladers. At the same time, Jorge had powered up a berg and shouted at Thomas and Brenda to get on board, but before they could reach the berg, however, one of the WICKED guards shot Brenda in the back and Thomas, Newt, and Minho rushed over to help her.

     Seconds later, Jorge emerged from the berg with a flamelauncher and incinerated many of the WICKED guards. Minho quickly grabbed Brenda and carried her to the berg and Thomas followed, but was shot by one of the WICKED guards before he could enter the vehicle. Thomas crawled with all his might towards the berg. When he eventually reached it, Newt and Minho shielded him and fired at the WICKED guards and dragged Thomas aboard as the hatch closed and Jorge took off and Thomas, Minho, Newt, Brenda, and Jorge finally escaped WICKED's headquarters as Thomas passed out.

    </p>
    <p key="94ed5b83-6ba6-4d0c-8bc3-c088bc3f3ee7">
     Thomas realized that the right time to read Newt's message to him was coming closer and began wondering what it meant. Later, the berg arrived in Denver and Thomas, Jorge, Minho, and Brenda disembarked and left Newt on board the berg. When the four went through security, Jorge used fake last names to gain access to the city. When the four finally got access to the interior of Denver, a man approached Thomas and told him that a group of people have escaped WICKED's headquarters and he believed that Thomas and his companions were part of the group. He then handed a message to Thomas and told him to accept the advice the message contained within before walking away.
    </p>
    <p key="98a0d9bb-372d-4fe0-8cea-ca0d31a63869">
     Thomas opened the message to find out that it was from his former nemesis

     <a href="The Right Arm.html" key="6c10e855-8110-4c09-a4f8-6fe0f7cd22ab" title="The Right Arm">
      Right Arm
     </a>
     . Thomas and Minho had a hard time believing it was Gally, but later came to understand that Gally was being used as a puppet by WICKED, was taken into custody, treated of his injuries, and set free. He somehow made it to Denver and suggested they see him before finding Hans when Jorge had told Thomas that the Right Arm is an organization with the goal of sabotaging WICKED for good. They took a taxi and reached the apartment, where Gally greeted them and told them that the end of the world is upon mankind. He let them in and Thomas apologized to Gally for fighting him and Gally apologized for killing Chuck.
    </p>
    <p key="52d3572d-15a4-4d40-acea-97f6079ad3d4">
     Gally told Thomas and his companions about the Right Arm taking action against WICKED, but it doesn't have enough resources to disrupt their activities. He revealed that a bunch of spies took him to Denver from WICKED's headquarters and after a few weeks, they heard about the escape from WICKED's headquarters through a netblock message. Gally also told Thomas that the Right Arm has two problems to deal with: The
     <a href="The Flare.html" key="24defe60-0d14-4c63-ac45-ea7955c0577f" title="The Flare">
      Flare

     is spreading slowly through Denver despite the city's official's attempts to cover it up, and many citizens who are immune to the Flare, called

     </a>
     , have been disappearing and an informant told Gally that they were taken by WICKED and imprisoned them somewhere he did not know, but he assumed it was to continue the Trials. Thomas then questioned Gally if he knew about Teresa's supposed escape along with the other Gladers the same day. Gally replied that he was well aware of both escapes and that the Right Arm also found them and that Teresa was his informant, making Thomas think she went through the removal of the
     <a href="Swipe.html" key="b0ae6e46-bfae-4bd0-8cdd-f05ef5c2630b" title="Swipe">
      Swipe
     </a>
     along with the others and possibly triggered the truth about WICKED's true intentions. Gally also informed Thomas that Teresa herself is searching for him and that Hans, the doctor who Brenda mentioned earlier, has a large bounty placed on his head and that WICKED wants him dead because they believe Thomas came to Denver for Hans.
    </p>
    <p key="f5d0b669-bdf9-4623-a302-80ac0b7b13ce">
     Afterwards, they leave and Thomas promised Gally that he would return. Gally replied that the Right Arm will take action soon and they need as many people and information as they can get and also warned Thomas that while there is not much time, there is still hope. Thomas and his friends eventually found Hans in his apartment and Brenda told hm that someone has placed a bounty on his head and that Thomas and Minho need the Swipe removed. Hans left to prepare. While waiting, Thomas began to lose control of himself and said he can't allow Hans to remove the Swipe. Thomas also unintentionally attacked his friends as he struggled to resist, which Brenda told Thomas that WICKED is closing in and he must fight the manipulation. Hans stormed into the room and attempted to stop it. Minho quickly subdued Thomas and pinned him to the floor and Brenda told Hans to remove the Swipe. Thomas eventually broke free and attempted to attack Hans, but was pinned down again by Minho and Hans attempted to remove the Swipe again. When Thomas attempted to break free a third time, Minho knocked him out, giving Hans enough time to remove Thomas's swipe and eventually Minho's swipe.
    </p>
    <p key="fe92dd0a-db5a-45b6-a30e-b32dbf096d8f">
     Thomas eventually woke up, now in control of himself. Thomas asked Minho about what happened while he was out. Minho told Tomas that Hans was successful in removing the Swipe in both of them. A second later, Brenda, Hans, and Jorge entered the room and Brenda informed Thomas that Hans is leaving Denver with his wife and that he successfully deactivated and removed the Swipe and also permanently disabled Thomas's ability to speak to Teresa through telepathy. Before leaving, Hans wished Thomas luck in doing what he does not have the courage to try. Thomas replied that if they defeat WICKED, he and his friends will come back for Hans.
    </p>
    <p key="68d542bb-427a-4f3b-a9ae-bcce796e9045">
     After Hans left, Brenda asked Thomas what they do next. Thomas told his companions that they needed to find Teresa and the other Gladers and return to Gally with them in order to help the Right Arm. He also mentioned that WICKED had created the Flare through a failed experiment and vowed that once the Gladers were together again, they would stop WICKED's operations and prevent them from putting the Immunes they've taken prisoner through the Trials like they once have. Afterwards, they discover Teresa's corpse when she saved Thomas from being crushed by a falling rock. Jorge and Aris later follow Thomas and the rest of the Gladers through the Flat Trans and into the last remaining paradise.
    </p>
    Jorge is presumed to be one of Paige's two partners (the second is Brenda) whom she secretly placed among the Immunes, as she mentioned in the epilogue.
