   Jed and his followers believed the heavens were punishing them for becoming lax, and to remind them of what they needed to become. They felt that trees, plants, and animals are magical, and that those who were hit with darts were demons. And since

As Jed talked to them, he felt a pain in his head. Sounds of people yelling, screaming, and laughing came from the woods. The Infected faction from the village had arrived.

   Jed pressed his hands against his head and moaned. As he writhed in pain, his followers knelt down and lowered their faces to the ground in a kind of worship. Jed screamed and yelled, "They've killed me! The demons ... finally ... killed me!" He died as blood seeped from his nose and mouth.

   Jed was described as a disfigured person with no hair and no ears. His face was hideously scarred from the Sun Flares, and his lips were yellow and malformed, twisted to one side.
