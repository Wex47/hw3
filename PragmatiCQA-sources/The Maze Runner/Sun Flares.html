   Little information is known about the event that would come to be known as the Sun Flares. It can be assumed that the Sun Flares was an extremely powerful coronal mass ejection released from the Sun. No information is given on whether or not humanity was aware of the impending disaster and if so, made preparations to safeguard people in the lead up to it. From what is revealed about the event in The Maze Runner series, it seems that no major action was taken to prepare for the disaster. Thus, it is likely humanity was completely caught off guard when the Sun Flares impacted the Earth in October 2136. The population was greatly diminished due to this natural disaster.

   When the solar flares impacted the Earth, the areas between the Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn, a region located both north and south of the equator, was directly impacted and thus the hardest-hit area. Approximately 4.5 billion people died within the first 15 minutes of the catastrophic event. Whole cities at or near the equator were all destroyed. Billions more would die in the subsequent firestorms, extreme heat, and tsunamis that ravaged the planet in the weeks to come. The Earth's magnetic field was greatly disrupted by the event, allowing for increased radiation to reach the surface.
  </p>
  <p key="0b65d3ad-f3ea-4e1d-ac22-e4816b8184bf">
   The event brought about severely drastic changes in the Earth's climate and in turn its biosphere. The increase in radiation levels coupled with climate change leads to the extinction of most agricultural crops as well as countless other species of animals and plant life.

   , a barren, desert-like wasteland filled with the burnt-out remains of countless cities. Meanwhile, violent weather phenomena such as extreme lightning storms became common. The event caused rapid melting of the polar ice caps, leading to a rise in sea level. As a result, many parts of the world, including most of Europe, were inundated.

   Human civilization was brought to the brink of collapse following the Sun Flares. A multitude of countries within the area directly affected by the solar storms, such as Mexico and India, were completely decimated. The many more countries that were not directly impacted suffered immense strain, if not outright collapsing, due to the subsequent natural and environmental disasters wrought by the solar storms. In addition, most forms of communication were disabled by the disaster.

   Despite the cataclysmic event, humanity nonetheless persevered. There were a number of survivors in the Scorch, eking out an a meager existence in its barren waste. Meanwhile, the remnants of many former governments joined to form the

  <p key="d53c01d6-9781-43f2-aefb-486b02b6db9a">
   Six months after the Sun Flares, the survey conducted by the PFC was completed. During a special resource conference, it was grimly revealed that there was insufficient amounts of food, drinkable water, and living space to effectively serve the remaining ~1.4 billion surviving people, with there being only enough sustainable resources left for about 70% of the remaining population (~980 million).

   , a former city council member of Blackfoot, Idaho, however, disagreed. She believed this would only lead to civil unrest and ultimately war that would threatened to fracture the PFC. She instead proposed that the remaining 30% (~420 million) had to be eliminated in some manner. She made note that Dr. Cooper, prior to the Sun Flares, was studying a gene that randomly occurs in about 30% of the population, and she believed that she was necessary to finding a way to target this gene. While initially wanting no part in the effective genocide of a third of the remaining human population, Dr. Cooper was informed that the PFC will move forward with the plan without her. Ava Paige, however, convinced her that if she stayed, the PFC would do the population reduction right so that innocent lives were not needlessly killed. Dr. Cooper ultimately relented, revealing a virus would be needed.
