As Thomas began to ask questions, Alby told him that he'd gradually get his answers and that he would give him the tour of the Glade the next day. Thomas nonetheless continued to ask questions, causing Alby to get angry with him. Alby proceeded to tell Thomas that he needed to accept his new life in the Glade. He reaffirmed that Thomas would get a tour of the Glade and left it to

     went out into the Maze to check on Minho's sighting of a dead Griever; however, the Griever turned out to be playing dead, and Alby got stung. Minho tried to half-carry him back to the Glade. However, they arrived outside the doors just as they began to close for the night. As he saw them approach, Thomas slipped out just as the doors closed in an attempt to help them. Minho was very angry at him for this, saying he had no hope. Believing their chances were better if they split up, Minho ran off, leaving Thomas and the now unconscious Alby alone together.

     Thomas, refusing to leave his friend behind, grabbed Alby and started running through the Maze. He eventually realized he was too tired to keep carrying Alby, but still wouldn't leave him, so he tied himself and Alby in vines that hung from the walls. As the Grievers rolled up the wall toward Alby, Thomas redirected them towards himself, and when the Grievers had picked up too much speed to miss him, he moved aside, throwing the Griever past him.

     together. As they approached, they braced themselves and faced the Grievers that had pursued them. They then used Thomas' dodging idea to lead the Grievers over the Cliff, saving Alby and themselves. They then started back towards the Glade, grabbing Alby on the way.

     went to check on Alby. He found him lying in the Map Room, stunned, with a cut across his forehead. The maps in the room were apparently burned by an unknown Glader; however, they turned out to be decoys, as the real ones had been moved. Alby later confessed that he burned what he thought were the maps and then slammed his head against the table to give himself an alibi. He then ranted about how they shouldn't try to escape the Maze because there was a

     After Alby had undergone the Changing, it appeared as if he feared the outside world due to his memories. He became distant and no longer trusted himself to make any decisions for the Gladers, leaving Newt in charge.
    </p>
    As the Gladers were attempting to escape the Maze, they were confronted by numerous Grievers. Afraid to return to the real world, and possibly believing that the death of one Glader would satisfy the Grievers, Alby did the unthinkable. He sacrificed himself to the Grievers, but unfortunately, his death was for nothing, as a bloody battle ensued in which many of the remaining Gladers were killed.
