Minho taunts him for stating the obvious, not getting Newt's point. Newt reacts uncommonly snappy and leaves the room to recompose himself. When he returns, another cutting remark from Minho sets him off completely, leading to an actual brawl between the two of them.

Before they could get inside a berg, a dozen WICKED guards stormed into the hangar and opened fire on Thomas and his friends. Minho told Jorge to start up a berg while they fight the guards. Jorge complied and ran off to power up a berg while Minho, Thomas, Newt, and Brenda fought the WICKED guards. The guards, unaware of the stolen weaponry the Gladers possessed, were easily underestimated and quickly beaten by the Gladers.

     At the same time, Jorge had powered up a berg and shouted at Thomas and Brenda to get on board, but before they could reach the berg, however, one of the WICKED guards shot Brenda in the back and Minho, Thomas, and Newt rushed over to help her. Seconds later, Jorge emerged from the berg with a flame launcher and incinerated many of the WICKED guards. Minho quickly grabbed Brenda and carried her to the berg and Thomas followed, but was shot by one of the WICKED guards before he could enter the vehicle. Thomas crawled with all his might towards the berg. When he eventually reached it, Minho and Newt shielded him and fired at the WICKED guards and dragged Thomas aboard as the hatch closed and Jorge took off. Minho, Thomas, Newt, Brenda, and Jorge finally escaped WICKED's headquarters as Thomas passed out.

     Ten hours later, Jorge landed the berg in a big clearing. Later, Thomas awakened and called a meeting with Minho and Newt to discuss going to a city called

     , an ex-scientist working for WICKED who has left the organization after discovering their true intentions and that he can remove the Swipe from the Gladers' brains and Minho agreed to go to Denver with Newt. After a meeting with them, Jorge reactivated the berg and flew off, heading for Denver as Thomas fell asleep.

    <p key="f0cde3be-f109-4fd7-a376-f20905699011">
     When they had another gathering, Minho asked why Brenda was with WICKED, but she explained that she was never with them and that after surviving so long in the

      Scorch
     </a>
     , she sees a chance. Brenda then mentioned Hans and WICKED's manipulation skills and that there are many people after them. Newt, however, cared little about the Swipe's removal and angrily told his companions not to persuade him to enter Denver and stormed off. Thomas realized that the right time to read Newt's message to him was coming closer and began wondering what it meant. Later, the berg arrived in Denver, and Minho, Thomas, Brenda, and Jorge disembarked and left Newt on board the berg. When the four went through security, Jorge used fake last names to gain access to the city. When the four finally got access to the interior of Denver, a man approached Minho and Thomas and told them that a group of people have escaped WICKED's headquarters and he believed that Thomas and his companions were part of the group and handed a message to Thomas and told him to accept the advice the message contained within the message and walked away.

    <p key="2cbfff0b-4285-4c6a-bd0f-86bdc58fdac9">
     Thomas opened the message to find out that it was from his former nemesis

     . Minho had a hard time believing it was Gally but later came to understand that Gally was being used as a puppet by WICKED, was taken into custody, treated of his injuries, and set free and somehow made it to Denver and suggested they see him before finding Hans when Jorge had told Thomas that the Right Arm is an organization to sabotage WICKED for good. They took a taxi and reached the apartment, where Gally greeted them and told them that the end of the world is upon mankind.

     . Gally told Minho and his companions about the Right Arm taking action against WICKED, but it doesn't have enough resources to disrupt their activities. He revealed that a bunch of spies took him to Denver from WICKED's headquarters and after a few weeks, they heard about the escape from WICKED's headquarters through a netblock message. Gally also told the group that the Right Arm has two problems to deal with: the Flare is spreading slowly through Denver despite the city's official's attempts to cover it up, and many citizens who are immune to the Flare, called Immunes, have been disappearing and an informant told Gally that they were taken by WICKED and imprisoned them somewhere he did not know, but he assumed it was to continue the

     Thomas then questioned Gally if he knew about Teresa's supposed escape along with the other Gladers the same day. Gally replied that he was well aware of both escapes and that the Right Arm also found them and that Teresa was his informant, making Thomas think she went through the removal of the Swipe along with the others and possibly triggered the truth about WICKED's true intentions. Gally also informed Thomas that Teresa herself is searching for him and that Hans, the doctor Brenda had mentioned earlier, has a large bounty placed on his head and that WICKED wants him dead because they believe Thomas came to Denver for Hans. Afterward, they left, and Thomas promised Gally that he would return and Gally responded that the Right Arm will take action soon and they need as many people and information as they can get and also warned Thomas that there is not much time, but there is still hope. Minho, Thomas, Jorge, and Brenda eventually found Hans in his apartment and, despite the alarm that set on Thomas's brain to stop it from happening and thanks to Minho's (among others) help, they got their implants removed.

     The next morning, Minho frees Thomas from the Pit, asking if the latter is having second thoughts. Thomas confirms that he's ready to go and Minho leads them to Section 7, which happens to be open. He spots a stained tank on the ground and concludes it was Ben's, meaning the former Runner had been here at one point. Thomas picks up on a beeping sound coming from the metal cylinder they ripped from the Griever's body and uses it to follow where the signal is strong. Eventually, they are led to the back of Section 7 and the cylinder unlocks a hidden door. The boys enter and find another area, which they conclude is the Griever's entrance. Something scans them and walls start to close, prompting both boys to return to the Glade. They share their information with the Gladers before Teresa tells them that Alby is awake.

Thomas is unable to get on the berg due to being shot in the stomach by Janson, but Teresa manages to throw him onto the ramp of the berg, allowing Minho, Gally, Frypan, Brenda, and Vince to pull him onboard. Teresa falls to her death when the tower building collapses. As Jorge flies Minho, Thomas, Gally, Frypan, Brenda, Vince, and the Immune teenagers away from the WCKD Tower, Minho helps Gally bandage Thomas' wound.
