Now a disease of rage and lunacy races across the eastern United States, and there's something suspicious about its origin. Worse yet, it's mutating, and all evidence suggests that it will bring humanity to its knees. 
Mark and Trina are convinced there's a way to save those left living from descending into madness. And they're determined to find it—if they can stay alive. Because in this new, devastated world, every life has a price. And to some, you're worth more dead than alive.

Mark shoots his pistol at the Green Suits while Alec shoots his grappling-hook gun into the Berg's hatch. Once Alec is safely on board, Mark shoots his own grappling-hook gun into the Berg's hatch. Once inside the Berg, Mark and Alec search the room for anything that will help break the locked door open. Mark finds a sledgehammer and hands it to Alec, who uses it to beat at the door. Meanwhile, Mark finds a hard-cased box with a biohazard symbol. Inside are 24 darts holding

   When Mark wakes up, he and Alec go back into the destroyed Berg and find a workpad. Using the GPS, they figure the enemy has a bunker between 50 and 60 miles away.

The girl says her parents were shot with the virus darts and died, while her brother Ricky went into the forest with the other survivors. Deedee reveals that she had been hit by a dart but didn't catch the Flare. The group decides to bring Deedee along, and Alec announces that they only have one full day of hiking left before they reach the enemy's headquarters.

Their goal is to reach the Lincoln Building before the tsunami hits and drowns them. As they enter the newer subtrans section, they end up in a fight with some punks until a monstrous wave of filthy water enters the substrans section.

   Mark wakes up and the group continues their journey. When Alec checks his workpad to see where they are, he determines they're five miles away from the enemy's headquarters and a few miles away from Asheville. Then they hear singing in the woods, and Deedee says the people singing are the survivors who lived in her village. Mark and Alec go to check things out and find people dancing around a bonfire while others stand and sing. A man and woman invite them to join, but Alec declines. Then the woman has them restrained and carried to the fire. Mark and Alec are placed in front of the two rows of people chanting, and the woman explains that Deedee brought the evil upon their village. She also calls Mark and Alec demons and has them beat up. Then a man without hair and ears speaks up and stops the beating. This man is named

Jed says those sounds are from the other faction from his village, those who caught the virus. Then Jed screams with pain and dies.

   Mark and Alec decide to head in the direction of the enemy's headquarters, hoping the girls did the same. Alec finds blood along the path. When they reach the headquarters, the girls are nowhere to be found. That's when a circular trapdoor emerges from the ground, as a Berg is approaching to land on the pad. Mark and Alec go into the trapdoor before the Berg lands and the landing pad closes. Two people get off the Berg and mention Alaska and the Flare. Mark and Alec go down a hallway and find doors open ajar. They find a room full of cots and a sick man named Anton. He tells them that Deedee was given back to the survivors of her village. Anton then tells them about the Post-Flares Coalition in Alaska, and how the Flare is transmitted by blood and can be airborne. The plan was to kill half of the world's population. Anton says that his coworkers plan to revolt by going to Asheville and taking the

When they get to the main street, they decide to start searching the homes for the girls. They eventually find Lana being pulled by her feet out from a mansion and onto the sidewalk. The Cranks begin stabbing Lana, so Mark and Alec vaporize them. Alec vaporizes Lana out of mercy.

As Cranks break their way into the house, Alec and Mark try to fight them off. There's too many Cranks, and the situation seems dire until Trina shouts for everyone to stop. She convinces the Cranks to let her and her friends leave in peace. The Cranks oblige until the group is halfway down the hallway and chaos ensues again.

   Mark decides they must go to Asheville in the hopes of being cured. Then he dreams about being in a cave with Trina, three months after the sun flares struck. Mark wakes up and finds Alec, who is really sick. They decide they need to get Deedee to Asheville before they turn crazy. As Alec gets the Berg running, Mark checks on the girls. He finds them huddled together and scared because the "boogieman" and his friends are in the ceiling. Mark runs back to the cockpit and grabs Alec's Transvice. When he returns to the barracks, three Cranks fall through the ceiling. Mark vaporizes them all. As he takes the girls to the cockpit, another Crank attacks from the ceiling and takes the Transvice before fleeing to another part of the ship.

   Mark brings the girls to the cockpit. Deedee is scared from the Berg's movements and runs off to the cargo room, where she runs into the Crank with the Transvice. The Crank had lived in Deedee's village and wants to send Deedee back to the demons. Mark's mind snaps and charges the Crank, knocking away the Transvice and dragging the Crank to the cockpit. Mark tries to throw the Crank out of the Berg's broken window when Alec loses control of the Berg, causing Mark and the Crank to fall out the window. The Crank clings to Mark as they descend toward the Berg's thruster. Mark knocks the Crank into the thruster and watches as the Crank's head and shoulders disintegrate while the rest of his body falls to earth. Mark climbs back up to the cockpit.

Alec drops Mark, Trina, and Deedee off near the PFC building, where they enter and see two people enter the Flat Trans. Mark hands Deedee a letter he had written, telling the PFC to use her because she's immune to the Flare. After Deedee says her goodbyes, she walks through the Flat Trans. As Bruce and his army arrive at the door of the building, Trina and Mark hug and kiss. As Alec crashes the Berg into the building, Trina whispers Mark's name.
