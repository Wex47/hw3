   on Minho and forced Thomas to watch from a screen, demonstrating to both of them that anyone who tried to escape would be harshly punished. They were also still working on the Griever itself and used this as a chance to test its mechanics, as well as study the reactions of both Thomas and Minho. While they did stop the Griever right before it hurt Minho, they repeated the experience several times, having Teresa,

   watch each subsequent time, leaving Minho traumatized. After the horrifying experience, Thomas went back and directed all his attention to building the Maze. Some time later, the Maze was complete.

   Right before they were sent in, Thomas went to say his goodbyes. His friends, who had been tolerating the idea of being sent in up until then, suddenly realized that Thomas and Teresa were not going in with them, and they felt betrayed. When Thomas was not able to answer truthfully about the Maze being his project, it only made his friends hate him more.

   After the initial group of forty or so were sent to the Maze, Thomas went to the observation room to check in on his friends; to his horror, he realized that they had all had their memories wiped, which had never been mentioned to him. Day after day, he watched them from the observation room. Sometimes Chuck or Teresa joined him.

   About a year after the beginning of the Maze Trials, Dr. Paige told him and Teresa that she suspected there was an outbreak of the Flare among some of the staff. They went to Chancellor

   , though not violent. Paige looked through some files on the chancellor's computer, and she deduced that he was covering up the Flare outbreak. She then went and got Rachel and Aris, along with four backpacks full of weapons and syringes of poison that would kill quickly. Paige told them that, being the few Immune available for the job, it was up to them to kill the chancellor and all nineteen other Flare-infected. Thomas and Rachel were horrified, but Teresa and Aris seemed resigned to doing it for the common good. All four of them euthanized the Cranks; Thomas and Teresa each nearly died when a fight broke out with some Cranks and were forced to shoot two of them dead.

   After the Purge, Thomas did not go to the observation room for some time. When he finally did, the first thing he saw on the screen was Newt limping along with Alby helping him. He looked at footage from the day before and pieced it all together, realizing that Newt had climbed up a wall in the Maze and tried to kill himself by jumping off, succeeding only in injuring his right leg.

   In the Scorch, Brenda and Jorge headed together toward the Crank city, while Thomas headed with the team to an underground tunnel, which someone explained was originally made by inmates escaping from a prison, and that WICKED had claimed it for their own purposes. They headed deep into the tunnel and activated a

   , stepping through to find themselves back in a brick building that was part of the WICKED facilities. Dr. Paige and Teresa were there to greet Thomas, and Teresa hugged him. Instead of riding the few miles back to the main facility with them, Thomas elected to walk there himself, even though it was at night; Paige assigned two guards to escort him. On the way there, they were ambushed by a Flare-crazed Randall Spilker, whom Thomas had not seen for some time. He killed both guards and sneaked through the trees, stalking Thomas. Thomas picked up a fallen guard's

   and contacted Teresa telepathically. Spilker charged him, and Thomas incapacitated him with a Launcher grenade. Then, he smashed his head in with the butt end of the Launcher. When Teresa and some others came to help him, they found him sitting there, horrified at what he had done.

   Day after day of seeing the horrors of the Maze made Thomas determined to do something about it. He concocted a plan and got Teresa's approval. They planned to get Paige to allow them to go into the Maze with their memories intact; once there, however, they secretly intended to lead the Gladers to freedom outside of WICKED. Paige seemed to agree to their plan.

   The night before Thomas went up into the Maze, Teresa and Thomas had a heartfelt conversation, in which Teresa pinkie-promised that they would soon be together in the Maze, both memories intact. She also told Thomas that he meant the world to her. They hugged and lay together in Thomas's bed all night long.

   However, the next morning Paige drugged Thomas with a cup of tea. As he slipped into unconsciousness, Paige told him that he was too trusting. She also admitted to him that it was she who had unleashed the Flare on the former chancellor and the nineteen others, all because they had disagreed with her vision for the Trials.

   Thomas's memory was wiped and he was placed in the Maze. At the very end of the book, there was an email from Teresa to the WICKED staff, saying that she thought the plan for her to keep her memories and coordinate things telepathically with Aris was a good one. She stated that she appreciated everything WICKED had done for her over the years and that, before going up in the Box, she would write "WICKED is good" on her arm, hoping that it would plant a seed in the minds of the Gladers who saw it.
