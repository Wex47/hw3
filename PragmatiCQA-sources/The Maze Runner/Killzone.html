   can limit the Killzone's activity. Since the Flare eats away at the brain faster when the brain works harder, the Bliss slows the disease down. If a person, for example, has a lot of stress, the Flare will eat away at the Killzone much faster. It's often quite easy to spot someone using the bliss and many cities have a punishment for using it.
