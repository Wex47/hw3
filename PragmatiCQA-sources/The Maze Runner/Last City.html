   The city's general history remains a mystery. In the Maze Runner novels, the city in which most of the events of the Death Cure took place was known as
   <a href="Denver.html" key="b359e161-e97a-4c47-b12a-7d7191e56f9e" title="Denver">

   .
   The city was likely, but by no means was certainly, a prosperous metropolis up until the impact of the solar storm. The Last City, as it likely had come to be known, would survive the cataclysmic event, albeit with its infrastructure possibly damaged. It is also possible that the city was constructed

   itself. The theory is increasingly plausible due to its many deviations from pre-Sun-Flare cities and lack of any resemblance to Denver.
  </p>
  <p key="77ad9149-cc72-41f6-9279-007379640cf7">
   According to WETA Digital (the VFX company behind the Last City's portrayal within the motion picture), the city was built directly upon Cape Town of South Africa
   . This theory is ever more plausible due to the fact that the Last City's road layout and some of its landmarks such as Portside Tower are consistent with that of Cape Town. This, coupled with the South African geography (including the inclusion of Cape Town's famous Table Mountain, Signal Hill which is shown to be very close to the City Wall, and the distant mountains) being directly consistent with what is portrayed in the film and the fact that Cape Bay, exactly like the Last City, was historically protected by a natural mountain range which relegated entry within via natural barriers are very clear evidences providing major plausibility to the theory that the Last City was built directly upon the ruins of Cape Town.

  <p key="7668237f-5da4-48a7-8474-44292db39164">
   Aside from theories, the Last City's general history remains a collection of esoterica. Basing off of the theory that the city existed before the Sun Flares, the

   </a>
   – and later WCKD – took over administrative control of the city, constituting major construction efforts in all areas of the metropolis, including several skyscrapers (most of which, including the buildings known as "Portside" and "YKS Megacorp" are presumed to be privately owned by corporate bodies) as well as WCKD's primary headquarters and research facility.
  </p>
  <p key="f2889ce9-743e-4905-83b6-df72b264805b">
   Sometime after the city's founding, or reconstruction, it increased in size immeasurably as refugees from the rest of the Scorch flocked to the safety, security and resumption of civilization that the authorities governing the area appeared to provide. It is presumed that, during this time, it became the largest post-Sun Flare megapolis in the world.

   is understood to have visited the city for some unknown reasons, making note of both WCKD's major presence there and the measures the organisation were taking to defend it. Sometime after this, WCKD likely began making preparations for safe zones in and around high density districts in the event that the checkpoints defending the city were breached, including the construction of a titanic protective wall in the 2.5km surrounding WCKD HQ
   .
  </p>
  <p key="ea2a90dc-432c-4e21-9a9f-9600d06a2664">
   Eventually, at least one of the quarantine checkpoints surrounding the city was breached, and shortly after this, many areas of the city likely began falling into chaos. It however must be noted that refugees continued to pour in from across the Scorch, as it is stated that, by the events of the Death Cure film, the slums that had accumulated around the inner-city wall stretched on for a massive 25km
   .

   steadily began retreating its urban operations to the well-defended inner sections of the city, while slowly leaving other neighbourhoods behind as the virus slowly took hold of everywhere beyond the wall. With the quarantine checkpoints now abandoned (and infested with

   ) the amount of refugees attempting to travel to the Last City itself is presumed to have later starkly declined; however, the denizens of the Last City themselves continued to flock to the safe zone at its centre. WCKD continued to permit entry to the safe zone, but entry procedures quickly became highly stringent so as to avoid a repetition of what caused the outer city to fall. Rules and safe zone policy became extraordinarily strict: curfews were strictly enforced; infection checks in public spaces were imposed; the city's network was integrated into one uniform digital space whose only constant was universal surveillance by WCKD; and other regulations so strict that even appearing to be infected in any way, such as coughing, was cause for deportation.
  </p>
  <p key="de6e54db-2ef2-4d00-be77-a4c788bc1575">
   It is worth noting however that a major civilian presence continued to reside in the outer city, showing that the Flare had not completely wiped out the population of the outer city.

   , ordered the closing of the city's primary entrance (and only entrance to civilians), the main gate. To the dismay of both the safe zone's urbanite inhabitants and the desperate refugees alike, Paige deemed the addition as a "temporary precaution" against the increasing threat of infection from the outside. This, along with the complete cut-off from the safety and supplies provided by WCKD from outside the wall, exacerbated tensions between the lawless survivors of the outer-city and the authorities in the inner-city – to the extent where the consensus among outer-city residents was that the people of the safe zone were careless to the rapidly worsening issues faced outside the city wall.

  <p key="05cfea44-39e0-4a0c-ba26-871f721822da">
   In the final month prior to the City's collapse, the people living and working in the city had begun to lose faith in WCKD's efforts in finding a

   , displayed the highest and most promising antibodies to the Flare seen thus far, the BoD unanimously expressed their newfound doubts to what appeared to be just another pipe-dream for a cure. They also expressed their own thoughts about instead protecting people from the threat instead of attempting to fight it and initially rejected Paige's request to initiate a new round of trials on the infected using the antibodies projected from subject A7. Faith was somewhat restored after

   Virus had been detected around the safe zone, and that at the rate it was spreading the city would be in the same state as its exterior in a month.
   Already affected by the Flare himself, Janson proposed the creation of another safe zone in an alternate location, but Paige, remorseful of WCKD's previous efforts to find a cure at any cost, replied, "It's not about giving up, Janson. It's about knowing when you've lost."

  <p key="3b1dc7f8-21a1-4472-965b-1fd73f55b487">
   WCKD reacted near instantaneously by evacuating their staff and research, sounding sirens to alert the inner city denizens to the breach and deploying Zone Control at key choke points around the city in a vain attempt to halt any advance made by the thousands upon thousands of refugees now pouring into the safe zone.

   WCKD's Zone Control, despite being highly trained and highly equipped, were completely outnumbered by the sheer quantity of people storming the city, and chaos slowly engulfed street after street. A massive conflagration ensued, leading to attacks on the very infrastructure that kept the city online.
