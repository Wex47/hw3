Fearing war and civil unrest, the Coalition searched for a means of population control that would eliminate large numbers of people quickly and as humanely as possible. The Flare was discovered by

However, after Chancellor

   The Flare was unstable and mutated, resulting in turning anyone who was in contact with the virus into cannibalistic, savage beings. The mutation rapidly increased the mortality rate of uninfected humans. Because the virus was airborne, the infection rate was reaching at global levels. The virus had spread throughout the globe, affecting city safe areas, and infecting the majority of the population. The rate of infection was sky-rocketing, so that quarantining the infection was impossible for the Coalition to handle.

WICKED attempted to examine the Immunes to find a cure by looking at how their brains reacted to certain situations, as well as the physical makeup of the Final Candidate's brain. Immunes are very rare, comprising less than one percent of the Earth's population, and as such, they were given the nickname "Munies" by those not immune out of spite and envy.

   It was made to cause no pain and quick death, however, this somehow went wrong, and caused people to get extremely painful headaches and very painful death when it was first spread.
The earliest stage of the Flare will often have infected individuals feel "off" somehow, exhibiting symptoms such as sudden mood swings, paranoia, poor balance, headaches that get worse as time goes on, irrational anger, and aggression. These symptoms last for approximately two to four months, but if individuals infected with the Flare are in constant stress, it can rapidly increase the infection rate of the brain.
  </p>
  <p key="7ef51294-5329-4374-96e3-8d7de9dcf717">
   These symptoms gradually worsen as the virus rapidly infects the cerebral cortex, resulting in suffering from dementia, temporarily memory-loss, and Alzheimers-like symptoms. The rapid decaying of the brain causes psychotic mental disorders to appear from the infected, stripping the victim of their humanity, and turning them into a demented, cannibalistic, zombie-like lunatic.

  <p key="7a084f22-102a-4eb5-91cb-57824050fd2d">
   If an infected individual has gotten to the point where sanity is completely lost, they are referred to as being past a stage known as "The

However, the drug is only affordable by the extremely wealthy, due to its high price, and simply delays the inevitable, thus not making it a cure. The Bliss slows the brain's activity, making a person seem more relaxed in various situations. It is quite easy to tell if a person has been taking the drug.

   , the symptoms differ from the novels. The earliest stage of the Flare starts with swelling blood vessels and angiitis-like symptoms. The infection gradually worsens with necrosis of the infected skin area. If an individual is infected but retains most of their intelligence, some will have strange vine-like bones protruding from their bodies which is the result of mutation growing from the virus.
