   , Crow's lower body was altered further. He could now freely move around the stage (which he did via unicycle and pogo stick) due to the bunraku style of puppetry. He was shown to have three prominent toes. During a scene in which Crow performed as a weight-lifter, his lower legs were a string of balls. A new ball-spring joint mechanism was built into his neck to allow him to look up and down.

   Upon Trace's departure, Bill Corbett took over Crow's operation and thus his voice became rougher, though Corbett's voice began to settle in and became more natural in episode 804,

   . The in-story explanation for Crow's voice change is that it developed during his 500+ years of solitude on the Satellite of Love while Mike and the other SOL inhabitants played at the edge of the universe as pure essences. Joel wryly noted when he dropped in during
   <i key="f7bd583b-520b-42b4-89c9-bd5c96bcdd62">

   that Crow had "changed his bowling pin," thus altering his voice. The show's writers later made a joke of the change in episode 904,

   , by suggesting that Crow's inherent characteristics included a change of voice every seven years.
  </p>
  <p key="2b577624-e3ef-4009-8f95-2486890a431c">
   Another noticeable difference between the two performances is that Trace's Crow is more animated, often "interacting" with the film (such as listening to train tracks in
   <i key="0037f766-452d-4b8d-acca-7d6f45feead3">

   ), and almost always leaning forward to look at something, moving his mouth or eyes slightly, and turning his head slightly. Corbett attributes this to Trace being a more skilled puppeteer, and on some occasions has jokingly justified the change by claiming Crow had a stroke some time during his isolation.
