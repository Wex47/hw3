    "No kidding. It’s mayhem. Everything is more toxic and more dangerous, sexier and more atrocious than you could ever see in your real life.

Then they do the thing and talk about what they just did. You do your life, then you talk about your life and they edit the two together as though they’re both happening in real time.
