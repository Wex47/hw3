   Gypsy's head was built out of a now impossible-to-find "Century Infant Love Seat," an infant car seat from the late 1970s to the early 1980s; the inner seal of the seat was used for her jaw. Parts of an Eveready "All American Lantern" flashlight were used for her eye; the flashlight's hood (which was also used to make Tom Servo's shoulder pauldrons) was left on Gypsy's eye initially but removed for most of the series. Foam pipe insulation was used on her lips, and her neck was made of long 4-inch drainage tubing over a skeleton made from 1 1/2 inch CPVC pipe. She was painted with Testors Purple Metalflake Hobby Spray Paint. In season 11, her eye was made from a RAYOVAC-EFL6V-BA Flashlight.
