   .  It is a sketch comedy show that utilizes a single, stationary camera mounted inside the center of a large rotating platform.  The wheel would stop and a sketch would play out, often framed by some piece of appropriate artwork or prop (for the purposes of forced perspective).  At the end of the scene, the wheel would rotate, carrying one scene out of the camera's view and bringing another in. Some scenes were self-contained on the platform, while others were open to the studio beyond the platform (and additional action would take place in the background).
