   The theater is usually assumed by fans to be located at the back of the SOL in the sense that the bridge is located up front (as seen in the Season 8-9 opening) while the series of doors are located around the central part of the SOL which thus leads to the back, but as the general size, length, and the amount of sections/rooms of the SOL is of great uncertainty, this leaves the proper location of the theater unknown (plus the theater's size is a lot bigger in contrast to the smaller bridge).

   During the original run, the theater scenes were filmed in the same area as the bridge. A white sheet was placed in front of the bridge counter to hide it. Joel would sit in front of a cardboard cutout of a row of theater seats, and the Bots and the puppeteers would sit behind them and control the robots. The actors would watch the movie on screens beneath their feet, and the movie would then be edited onto the white sheet after filming.
