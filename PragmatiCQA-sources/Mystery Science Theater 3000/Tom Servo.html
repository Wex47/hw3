   Servo's personality changed slightly through the series. In the early years, Servo was somewhat pompous and even arrogant towards the other characters. Gradually, these traits softened, and although Tom let his pride get the better of him on several occasions, he also showed more thoughtfulness towards others, though not necessarily tact.

  <p key="e12400bf-0bfc-4b11-904e-7a9c06f6e03d">
   Tom was also easily rattled on several occasions, often letting his temper get the better of him or showing little patience, especially after being teased by Crow. He is highly intellectual and often shows deeper and a more complex level of thought than the other Satellite residents. This is demonstrated most overtly in the episode

   More than that, Tom Servo seems to be an autodidact and polymath, knowledgeable in such diverse areas as the Greek classics (Homer) and mythology, philosophy (he has described himself as a "Humist", or follower of David Hume, an 18th century Scottish philosopher known for his philosophy of empiricism, amongst other areas), physics ("Mom, is space curved?" he has one on-screen character ask, referring, perhaps, to the works of Minkowski and his one-time student, Albert Einstein), and he seems not unacquainted with the works of Steven Hawking and Roger Penrose, and higher mathematics ("Are Gaussian equations flawed due to their strictly Euclidian view of the universe?"). It's debatable whether some or all of this is just a pretense, subject to the whims of his extreme emotional lability and moment-by-moment egoic needs. At the end of

   , Tom referred to the Three Laws of Robotics as defined by Isaac Asimov, specifically the First Law which states that "a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm" (though Joel says "kill" in this scene rather than "injure" or "harm"). This would imply that Tom (and presumably the rest of the 'Bots on the SOL) has been programmed with these Laws. Despite this, there were several times throughout the series history where Tom (and the other 'Bots) harmed a human, intentionally or otherwise. The other two Laws state that robots must obey humans and protect their own existence, except in instances where doing so would contradict the First Law. Tom and the other 'Bots have all been shown violating these laws, so it possible that they were programmed in as something closer to guidelines or suggestions.

   Tom Servo is a red puppet that has a gumball machine (Carousel Snack Dispenser) for a head, a body composed of a toy "Money Lover Barrel" coin bank, and an engine block from a Talbot Toys dune buggy,
   and a bowl-shaped hovercraft skirt or hoverskirt (a Halloween 'Boo Bowl' with black vacuum formed Tyco Turbo Trains spaced around) instead of legs. His arms are from a pair of obscure small doll hands on the ends of springs and upper arms from a C'more Bunz Novelty doll that are not really functional as arms, a point that is commented on occasionally throughout the series. (Oddly, though, some episodes feature Tom with objects already in his hands, raising the unanswered question of how they got there.) His shoulders are made from the front of an Eveready Floating Lantern. He is painted with Testors Red Metalflake. Because Servo's head is transparent,
   chromakeyed
   images appear projected through it, and thus a second puppet was built for use in the theater segments, entirely spray-painted black. This black Servo also appeared in a host segment in
