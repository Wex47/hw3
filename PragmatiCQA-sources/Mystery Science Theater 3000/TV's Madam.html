    The puppet Madame (a bawdy old movie star with a naughty sense of humor) was popular with audiences in the 1970s and 1980s. She appeared on a number of comedy/variety shows with American puppeteer Wayland Flowers, her creator.

    Madame's character is that of an "outrageous old broad" who entertains with double entendres and witty/sarcastic/sardonic comebacks. Madame's appearance and wardrobe are based on movie stars such as Gloria Swanson.

    Though the character's name is typically pronounced "Madam", it is consistently spelt "Madame".

    , which aired for one first-run season from September 20, 1982 until February 25, 1983, although the actual number of episodes produced is disputed (IMDB.com lists 51, Wikipedia includes a claim that there were as many as 75 or 150). The show was unusual for a sitcom in that it was produced for first-run syndication to air five days a week.

    On the sitcom, Madame lived in a plush mansion with her butler, ex-boxer Pinkerton (Johnny Haymer). They interacted with Madame's bookish secretary Bernadette (Susan Tolsky), Madame's beautiful, IQ-challenged, southern-belle niece Sara Joy (Judy Landers), and nosy kid neighbor Buzzy (Corey Feldman).
