   Dr. Forrester (full name Clayton Deborah Susan Forrester) has been a mad scientist ever since his youth, when he was a member of Evilos (a mad scientist version of
   Webelos
   ), where he grafted the rear end of a dog onto the rear end of a cat "and they all laughed." During his youth, he played the trombone.
  </p>
  <p key="2f56d2c4-767c-49e2-a23e-41e80961ecce">
   Clayton has expressed a fixation with figure skating that he closely linked to his scientific ambitions. He referred to "Oslo...I was found drunk and woozy...scratching the name
   Toller Cranston
   into my thigh with a nail." Other pivotal moments in his early life include a 1956 visit to "Sun Valley...where I was found behind the soft-serve machine, drooling over a picture of
   Dick Button
   " and a visit to "the Ice Capades, [where] I was hot-riveting my kneecaps to
   Peggy Fleming
   's zamboni."
  </p>
  <p key="9c8dbce0-bd07-4394-a091-2c0c38814b8f">
   Forrester's high school career was typified by a series of humiliations, presumably contributing to his unstable personality. Frequently teased by classmates, he received a "shameful expulsion" from the Chess Club, suffered a "shameful shower incident" during his sophomore year, got rejected by the Swing Choir, was frequently victimized by book-dumpings after typing class, was forced to do power sit-ups in gym, and received "the revulsion, scorn, and rejection of all the pretty girls." At some point, he was struck by lightning, resulting in the white streak in his hair and mustache. This may have happened more than once.
  </p>
  <p key="1f93e871-b481-4586-acab-0963ec938716">
   While earning his doctorate, Forrester took some undergraduate courses in Super-Villainry, and at some point he joined the Fraternal Order of Mad Science. He was a frequent attendee of the Mad Scientist Convention, although he lost the convention's invention contest each year (on one occasion his entry, "the More Painful Mouse Trap," was met only with laughter). In response to his rejections, he has blown up the convention center twice and once used incendiaries to not "actually make the building blow up, it just made it burn...really quickly. Oh it was beautiful."
  </p>
  <p key="97c03a54-b0ab-4e2c-a321-c39a77c1181e">
   Dr. Forrester has expressed happiness upon the Seattle Mariners had won a baseball game, indicating that he had become a fan of that team at some point.
  </p>
  <p key="e47fe384-c026-488c-9db1-f7896abded62">
   At some undisclosed point, Clayton was reported to have had a relationship with

   While working at Gizmonic Institute, Forrester and Erhardt developed an experiment to see if cheesy movies could be used to drive people insane, thus proving the scientist with a strategy that would enable them to take over the world.

   Then, in an

   , Dr. Forrester was visited by a monolith-like giant videocassette labeled "The Worst Film Ever Made" before evolving into a star baby. Pearl then took possession of the now-infant Clayton, vowing to raise him right this time, to which the baby Clayton responded "Oh, poopie".

   In the future year of 2525, Pearl (who had been cryogenically frozen centuries earlier and revived by intelligent Apes) revealed that although she had intended to do a better job raising Clayton the second time around, she "got busy and never got around to it", so she murdered him in his youth as his twisted personality manifested once again.

   By far the longer-lived of Forrester's associates, TV's Frank was generally the target of abuse by his awful boss. Despite this, Frank was surprisingly friendly toward Forrester and displayed some moments of genuine affection toward him. Frank worked for five years with Dr. Forrester, apparently dying and being revived by Forrester several times. When Frank eventually died permanently, Dr. Forrester was despondent of the loss of his sidekick until his mother arrived.

   Pearl was typically domineering, insulting and demeaning to Clayton, even though she claimed to have his best-interests at heart. In return, Forrester was deferential to his mother, often eager to gain her affection (which was never forthcoming). He could, however, show a callousness to her, such as his lack of concern when she was ill, his willingness put her "in a home", and his eagerness to transform one of her suitors into the Chicken of Tomorrow. However, unlike his relationship with Frank, Clayton was extremely hesitant to inflict physical harm on his mother.

    Dr. Forrester may be considered an unreliable source concerning matters from his personal history, as he has been established to be "mad" and has been shown to lie when it suits the narrative he wishes to construct. Thus, his accounts of his obsessions with ice skaters or his claims about romantic encounters may not be wholly accurate.

    The discipline in which Forrester holds his degree has not been specified. It is unclear if he is a doctor of medicine or if he holds a PhD (or both, or neither). He has demonstrated a certain level of proficiency at mechanical engineering, as well as biology and genetics. He also seems to have an understanding of psychology and marketing.
