     America's Funniest Home Videos
    </b>
   </i>
   is an American comedic video clip television series on ABC, which features humorous homemade videos that are submitted by viewers over which jokes are told. The most common videos feature unintentional physical comedy (arising from incidents, accidents, and mishaps), pets or children, and some staged practical jokes.

   Originally airing as a television special in 1989, it debuted as a regular weekly series in 1990. It was hosted by Bob Saget for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons, then by John Fugelsang and Daisy Fuentes for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as D.L. Hughley and Richard Kind, ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in the summer of 2001 with new host Tom Bergeron, who was the series' longest-serving host, hosting 15 seasons. Bergeron announced in 2014 that he would be departing as host of the show, and Alfonso Ribeiro took over as host in 2015.

   was a natural fit for Josh and Trace, since writing for the show basically consisted of "riffing" on the video clips.
