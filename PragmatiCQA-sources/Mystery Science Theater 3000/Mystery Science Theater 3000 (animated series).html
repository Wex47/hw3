   New episodes were scheduled to be posted every Monday. However, despite regular updates to other parts of the site, no new episodes of the cartoon were posted after November 26, 2007. In June 2008, the website was redesigned and the cartoons removed for unspecified reasons.  However, the cartoon likenesses of the characters were still present on some pages. On July 18,

   stated that the costs were low and the flat rates never changed from the original estimates. She suspected that the revenue was the problem as the mouse pads, post-it notes, and T-shirts being sold to pay for the show did not sell as well as expected, due to the poor fan reaction to the shorts.

   Initially, response to the new website on both of the major fan discussion boards was largely negative.
   Viewers of the Flash series had said that the animation was poor and the voice actors did not fit with the characters.
