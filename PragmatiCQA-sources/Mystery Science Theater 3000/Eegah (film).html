   One night after shopping, Roxy Miller is driving to a party through the California desert when she nearly runs her car into Eegah, a giant caveman. She tells her boyfriend Tom Nelson and her father Robert Miller about the giant. Her father, a writer of adventure books, decides to go into the desert to look for the creature and possibly take a photograph of it. When his helicopter ride fails to show up at his designated pickup time, Tom and Roxy go looking for him.
  </p>
  <p key="a27dc89e-9640-4ae7-aed6-4313c97aae3d">
   Roxy is soon kidnapped by Eegah and taken back to his cave while Tom searches for her. In Eegah's cave, Roxy is reunited with her father, who tells her that he has begun to communicate with the caveman and has developed a theory as to the creature's astounding longevity. When a frisky Eegah expresses what seems to be romantic interest in Roxy, her father, fearful that the creature may kill them both if he is rebuffed, suggests she put up with as much of it as she can bear. Eegah never tries anything too explicit, though, and Roxy even ends up giving him a shave before Tom arrives and helps the Millers escape. Crushed, Eegah follows them back to civilization, a final confrontation ensues, and Eegah is killed.

    This movie was made on a budget of about $15,000 - an uncommonly low budget for a color film, even by 1962 standards. Much of the dialogue was lost during filming, and large sections of the film are dubbed as a result. These disadvantages did not hurt the film's profitability, and by 1980 it had grossed more than $1 million.

    , the writers mention that they considered the scene in which Eegah lolls his tongue around and laps up shaving cream to be one of the most disgusting things they've seen while working on the show. There was also speculation that some kind of romantic relationship existed between Arch Hall, Sr. and actress Marilyn Manning (who was Hall's secretary at the time of production), due to the non-familial chemistry the pair exhibited.
