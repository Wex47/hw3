   Vasquez pitched Invader Zim to Nickelodeon, who desired a series for their older demographic. As the series went on, ratings declined and budgetary issues became more frequent. Before the second season was completed, Nickelodeon cancelled the series, leaving several episodes and a planned TV movie series finale unfinished. The show first-ran on Nick from 2001 to 2002, with a handful of second season episodes going unaired; these episodes were later seen on Nicktoons Network in 2006.
