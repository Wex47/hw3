   The show was becoming very demanding for Joel. While the schedule on a day-to-day basis was light, it left little room for outside projects, as an episode took two weeks to produce. Jim Mallon wanted Joel to focus on the show that they already had. Joel and Mallon were now fighting for creative control of the show.

   Hodgson left the show in 1993 after a struggle with producer Jim Mallon over a big-screen adaptation of the show. "I felt like it would split the company and ruin the show," says Hodgson, "It felt like 'Mommy and Daddy are fighting but we don't want the kids to know'. My leaving was kind of like a personal tragedy, but I felt like if I stayed and fought for creative control of the movie, it would wreck the show. So I walked away instead of letting King Solomon cut the baby in two."

There were these amazing magic catalogs where you could find any trick that you would see a magician do on TV. But because my parents were really big do-it-yourselfers, I started learning to build my own stuff, like magic tables and tricks. Through high school I figured I’d be a comic magician.

    "It was a great job because really we just hung out, watched bad movies all day and said stuff, and had somebody there with a computer recording everything and putting it to time code. That was the secret of it — we had all this material, every movie had like 700 or 800 riffs and there wasn't any way when we started to create a script that would be a normal script but also have 700 riffs in it. We had to figure that out, but that's what allowed us to make the show. We were able to use a Mac and write everything down and record it and attach it to the movie via time code."

    "We started out riffing the movies in real time, like improvising. When we got paid to do it, I just decided we had to start writing them. It was going to be a national show and my friends were going to see it. It wasn't going to be a local show in Minneapolis. We would take about a week when we started to write them, and pretty soon within the first season, it took us about five days, and there were between six and eight of us writing these shows. It was a pretty quick turnaround, and since nobody had ever movie riffed before as a TV show, we didn't have anything to compare it to. We just did as much as we could and then moved on. There was nothing prior to help us go, "Oh, we're shooting for that." It was this new land that we had found."

We didn't do any of those things. When we started, it wasn't like they treated us like a real show. It was like sitting at the little kids table at Thanksgiving: "Oh yeah, that's cute. I get it, you're in theater seats and saying smart things." It wasn't like real comedy people when it started. I have to say, it really all changed when the show was done and there were almost 200 episodes. And then with the Internet, people found it.

    "(Laughs) What was going on with syndicated TV was all these guys who were producers and distributors of these B-movies, they basically created movie packages they were licensing to all these local TV channels. When you're a little local TV channel like KTMA, when you bought a movie package, half the movies you had heard of or were good movies, and the other half were these B-movies. Every little TV channel had these movies and they could run them because the next movie was going to be good — and by good movie I mean like Tarzan or something like that. We just started to get the movies out of the archive at KTMA that were already licensed as part of a movie package. Those first 22 episodes were just what was there, and when we went to Comedy Channel, HBO/Downtown Productions were the ones who would get rights to a movie. They would send us big boxes of VHS tapes, and (co-star)

    , he loves movies more than anybody, he would watch every movie and pick his favorites. During lunch, we'd just watch them and pick out the movies we thought would work well. It wasn't that hard. In some ways, the distributors were kind of shocked. We were going, "We don't want to pay for these good movies. We just want the crap movies." That was very disorienting to them, like if you're buying cocaine from a dealer and just said, "No, We just want the baby powder instead of the cocaine.

She was in good movies, and she was in really terrible movies. Actors really understand the reality of that more than anybody. This is probably getting a little too theoretical, but movies back then were so sacred. Movies are something you should be impressed with, movies are magic and they're big and they come into theaters and they come on TV and you should be really impressed all the time. We messed with that a little bit and disrupted that, but really at the end of the day all the people making them kinda go, "Yeah, you know, a friend of ours was doing a movie and he wanted us to be in it and we made $600 that week."

    was one that I thought would be pretty awesome. The truth is, I don't really think of it like that. Movie riffing isn't about serving justice on a bad movie. It's really just collaborating with a movie to make entertainment. It isn't about saying, "You, sir, just wasted $120 million by not making a good movie, and because of that I'm going to riff you." That's kind of the coloring-book version of what we do. It's really just, "Hey, we just want to hang out with you. You're like Margaret Dumont, and we're going to be the Marx Brothers." Everyone looked at Margaret Dumont and believed she didn't know she was in a funny movie. It just shows you what a genius she was. I'm like everybody else — when I'm in a movie theater, I'm relaxing and hoping for what everybody hopes for when they watch a movie: that it'll take you into it. I compare it to a magic show. A really good magic show is amazing, but a bad magic show is even better."

    "It was never clear to me when I was working on the show what was a great episode and what wasn't. Each MST3K is so epic—there are like 800 riffs in every show. So it's really like a message in a bottle. They all go out and then certain ones come back."

    . It's this really epic, two-part training film for salesmen I think for Chevrolets. And it's when the auto industry is at the height of its powers and could make these Hollywood-grade productions. It gets into the guy's life and what he's dealing with at home and his mom and his dad and it's really funny. Those two together work really well."

    , but I'd really stopped performing. And so I was kind of reluctant, but I knew I would be the easiest sell in the event that somebody wanted to pick up the show. But once it got so popular and the movie was on the horizon, I started to go, "You know, I just don't... I don't really... I didn't really have that in mind, to be a movie actor." 'Cause, if you notice, I'm not really an actor. I just do this guy. Like, even when I went back and did the season opener on the Sci-Fi channel last weekend [April 11], people were going, "You looked kind of uncomfortable." And I was. I never had to act with another person. I was on the set with Mike [Nelson], and I was going, "I've never done this with another person in the room. It's only been robots." There was never anybody else in there. I can't really do it. I don't think I'm an actor. That's really not what I want to do. I don't think I could be on camera."
