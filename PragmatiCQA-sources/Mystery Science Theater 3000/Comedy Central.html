   However, 1993 brought about strains in the relationship, perhaps due to a large slip in the show's ratings. Comedy Central stopped paying the Brains to make promos for new

   during the theater segments. Similar measures were taken when Comedy Central also began to
   crawl
   jokes at the bottom of the screen, covering up the silhouettes. Another outcry happened when it was learned Comedy Central planned to edit, without consulting the Brains, five to seven minutes of footage from season two and three episodes to make them fit into the newer-style programming schedule that included longer commercial breaks. Eventually, the episodes were left untouched and allowed to run into the next ten minutes of programming.
   At the same time, Comedy Central and Best Brains worked together to plan and execute the first ever

   Shortly after, Comedy Central made the choice to stop the midnight reruns of the show, upsetting fans and concerning the Brains. A compromise was created in the form of a viewer's choice slot that would run on Friday evenings,
   <i key="8c5c0ef9-ba22-46c2-b96d-b97de9fcc9f9">

   ; it allowed viewers to vote over the internet for the episode that would be shown, and while it showed a great deal of promise, it failed to work out in the end amid charges of vote fraud.
   However, the MSTies were not done butting heads with Comedy Central, especially the internet-based ones. Comedy Central's programming chief and co-founder Vincent Favale came on air before a Saturday episode airing, defending the cutting of the midnight episodes and stopping just short of outright insulting fans. He made a second appearance during an unprecedented call-in show aired a half-hour before the next week's Saturday episode, but refused to show respect to the MSTies in that venue either. After putting back daily weekday showings at noon for a while, Comedy Central quietly resumed the midnight showings in 1995. Promos that aired during that time had the Comedy Central announcer state that viewers succumbed to "more MST belly-aching".

  <p key="a7ae17e5-32c5-4335-9176-44fedbff95bc">
   Around the same time, Comedy Central did not make its annual announcement to renew the Brains' contract, leaving season seven in doubt.
   Negotiations produced slightly improved relations between them, as well as

   However, things continued to fall apart. One of the first decisions made was to unearth the first season episodes that Comedy Central still had the rights to air, ignoring the agreement made three years before. Eventually, a compromise was reached that allowed the Brains to pick four episodes to air. They also agreed, even with the small amount of money offered, to do segments for that year's very short

   Soon after, the final bomb dropped. Best Brains formally announced that Comedy Central had ordered no new episodes and decided not renew their contracts. Comedy Central was caught off-guard and stopped just short of declaring the show canceled, and declaring that low ratings were the reason no new episodes had been ordered. Many believed that it was simply that the relationship between the two companies had degraded to a point beyond salvation and compromise. The schedule of episode airings became thinner and Comedy Central let the rights to many movies drop, making a limited amount of episodes available for air anyway. Negotiations went back and forth for several weeks, but in the end, Best Brains announced on March 14, 1996, that Comedy Central had released them from their contract, leaving them free to seek a new network.
