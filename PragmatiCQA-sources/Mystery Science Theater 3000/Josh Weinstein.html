   , Weinstein explained that when the show was sold to cable TV, Hodgson and Mallon refused to make him an equal partner in the company (unlike Beaulieu and Murphy) and paid him significantly less than the other cast and writers. Weinstein speculated that his youth and aggressive attitude may have contributed to the treatment he received. He stated that he has since resolved his issues with Hodgson and the other cast and writers, but he has little interaction with Mallon.
