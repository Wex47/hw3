   The channel was launched on September 24, 1992, as a sister cable channel to
   USA Network
   by then-owners
   Paramount Pictures
   (which was later acquired by
   Viacom
   in 1994) and
   MCA
   (then part of Japanese electronic giant
   Matsushita
   ), the owner of
   Universal Studios
   , each with a 50% stake in the venture.

   The channel was seen as a natural fit with classic film and television series that both studios had in their vaults, including
   Rod Serling's

   Gene Roddenberry
   and author
   Isaac Asimov
   were among those on the advisory board.
In 1997,
   Seagram
   , which bought MCA in 1995, purchased Viacom's interest in USA and Sci-Fi and sold the networks to
   Barry Diller
   in 1998 to form USA Networks, Inc. Diller later sold USA's non-shopping (film and TV) assets, including Sci-Fi, to Universal's then-parent
   Vivendi Universal
   in 2002. Vivendi's film, television, and cable TV assets were then merged with
   General Electric's
   NBC to form NBC Universal in 2004.
