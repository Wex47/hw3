   . Although neither Meacham nor his assistant Joe Wilson have heard of the device, they immediately begin construction. When they finish, a mysterious man named Exeter appears on the device's screen and tells Meacham he has passed the test. His ability to build the interocitor demonstrates that he is gifted enough to be part of Exeter's special research project. Intrigued, Meacham is picked up the next day at the airport by an unmanned, computer-controlled Douglas DC-3 aircraft with no windows. Landing in a remote area of Georgia, he finds an international group of top-flight scientists already present – including an old flame, Dr. Ruth Adams. Cal is almost immediately suspicious of the odd-looking group of men leading the project

   Cal and Ruth flee with scientist Steve Carlson, but their car is attacked and Carlson is killed. When they take off in a Stinson 108 light aircraft, Cal and Ruth watch as the facility and all its inhabitants are incinerated, and their aircraft is drawn up by a bright beam into a flying saucer. They learn that Exeter and his group are from the planet Metaluna, having come to Earth seeking uranium deposits as well as scientists to help defend their planet in a war against the Zagons. Exeter informs the humans that he is taking them back to his world. Exeter and the Metalunans are attacked by Zagon starships guiding meteors as weapons against them and Metaluna. The Metalunan saucer easily avoids each attack, dodging oncoming meteors.

  <p key="5eaa9846-8b98-47a4-9219-0ce0036fbc83">
   Exeter and the two humans arrive to find the planet under bombardment and falling quickly to the enemy. Metalunan society is breaking down and there is little hope. Their leader, known as the Monitor, reveals that the Metalunans intend to relocate to Earth and insists that Meacham and Adams be subjected to a Thought Transference Chamber in order to subjugate their free will so they cannot object. Exeter believes this is immoral and misguided, since it would impede the humans' ability to help the Metalunans. Before the couple are sent into the brain-reprogramming device, Exeter decides to help them escape.

   Exeter is badly injured by a Mutant while the three flee from Metaluna in the saucer as the planet's protective "ionization layer" becomes ineffective. Under the Zagon bombardment, Metaluna heats up and turns into a lifeless "radioactive sun". The Mutant also boards the saucer and tries to attack, but dies as a result of pressure differences on the journey back to Earth. As they enter Earth's atmosphere, Exeter sends Cal and Ruth on their way in their aircraft, but Exeter himself is dying and the ship's energy is nearly depleted. The ship flies out over the ocean and rapidly accelerates until it is enclosed in a fireball and finally crashes into the water and explodes.

    went on record in interviews promoting this film that when the scenes involving the Mutant came up during the premiere, they were tempted to sneak out of the theater.

    The Metaluna flying saucer design was based on a famous photograph of an Unidentified Flying Object. In
    1950
    , a farmer in McMinnville, Oregon named Paul Trent photographed a strange craft flying overhead before it sped off at fantastic speed and disappeared over the horizon. The event has since become known as "The McMinnville Incident", and Trent's photographs have never been proven to be a hoax. They remain among the best photos ever taken of a UFO.

    A sequel to this film was announced as being in "pre-production development" at the studio in 1956 after screenwriter Franklin Coen and producer William Alland submitted a script titled "Aliens In The Skies" to Universal Pictures. However, the studio head Edward Muhl rejected the project when he saw the proposed budget for the film, which was to be shot in Technicolor and CinemaScope and feature Rex Reason and Faith Domergue reprising their roles. Muhl deemed the project too expensive, believing that a science-fiction movie in the 1950s should be a cheaply-made B-movie with a monster in it to appeal to children.
