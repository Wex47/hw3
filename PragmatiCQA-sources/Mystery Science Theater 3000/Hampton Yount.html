After an initial meeting, Hampton and Baron participated in a test session on Skype where "they did great first reads on the respective characters, but it was the stuff between takes that kind of took [Joel's] breath away".

   Crow didn't sound exactly like Trace Beaulieu's, Joel sees the bots as "manifestations of the people running them" and "the point of being a movie riffing robot is that you can do a bunch of voices and dialects – not just sound like the last guy".
