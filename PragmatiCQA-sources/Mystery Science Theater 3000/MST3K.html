   Since the end of the Film Crew, both Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett have joined Mike at RiffTrax and their productions have become much more elaborate. Now, in addition to the audio-only downloads, RiffTrax produces fully synched videos of riffed films, live shows with guests, music and other extras, as well as more fully-fleshed video releases with "host segments". In 2012 Nelson, Murphy, Corbett, and RiffTrax CEO David G. Martin bought out Legend's interest in the company, making it completely independent.
