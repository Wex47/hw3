But the way it was structured, from a business standpoint, it was just impossible to produce anything else and be fair to everyone involved.

It's really people-powered. Comic-Con is really just Hollywood blowing you away with how much money it has and awing you with its giant displays and you really are, as a fan or an observer, you're really put in this category. Here it really just, like, flows everywhere. You just can see people being creative and kind of doing their own thing. I think this one fits much better, I prefer this con way more than Comic-Con."

    "Yeah, Michael Weldon's 'The Psychotronic Video Guide' was our bible. We sat on the floor and read it to each other for a week. We’d circle movies we thought sounded good -- ‘Oh, we want this one!’ -- thinking we could just submit this list to the Comedy Channel and they'd get them for us. But the reality was they’d send us a big box of tapes and we'd just sort through them. We thought we could say, “Well, we like these two . . . these over here are great . . . ” But then they would come back to us and say, “Well, you've got to take these three, and these other two that you don’t like,” because they were all from distributor licensing agreements. And sometimes the ones we didn't request were the most painful and probably made the best episodes . . . because we were actually living the pain."
