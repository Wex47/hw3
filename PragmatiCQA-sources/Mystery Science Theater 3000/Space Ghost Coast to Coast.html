    Space Ghost Coast to Coast

   (also known as SGC2C) is a late-night comedy talk show on the Cartoon Network. It combined archival animation, new animation, and live action elements.
  </p>
  <p key="8885db25-4978-4a06-8f4c-b2568b6d25d1">
   The premise of the show was that the super hero Space Ghost was now the host of a talk show. His bandleader Zorak (a humanoid mantis) and producer/director Moltar (a lava man) were former enemies that had been pressed into his service. Other villains would appear in recurring roles.
