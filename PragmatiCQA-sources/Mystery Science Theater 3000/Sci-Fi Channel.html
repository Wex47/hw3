   The channel was launched on September 24, 1992, as a sister cable channel to
   USA Network
   by then-owners
   Paramount Pictures
   (which was later acquired by
   Viacom
   in 1994) and
   MCA
   (then part of Japanese electronic giant
   Matsushita
   ), the owner of
   Universal Studios
   , each with a 50% stake in the venture.

   The channel was seen as a natural fit with classic film and television series that both studios had in their vaults, including

In 1997,
   Seagram
   , which bought MCA in 1995, purchased Viacom's interest in USA and Sci-Fi and sold the networks to
   Barry Diller
   in 1998 to form USA Networks, Inc. Diller later sold USA's non-shopping (film and TV) assets, including Sci-Fi, to Universal's then-parent
   Vivendi Universal
   in 2002. Vivendi's film, television, and cable TV assets were then merged with
   General Electric's
   NBC to form NBC Universal in 2004.
