   , is a top research laboratory. The institute is housed in a large building, shaped both like a gear and like the letter 'G'. It stands about seven floors above ground, with at least 13 sub-basements. The institute has research and development for almost everything from bio-spheres to orbiting satellites, with advanced materials such as high-density
   Kevlar
   and
   molybdenum
   (as evidenced by the materials Joel scavenged to create

   The facility is backed by a small mountain, with a sign reading "GIZMONIC INSTITUTE". Spacecraft can be launched from this mountain. Surrounding the facility is a large office building that is nearly twice the height of the institute itself. The office can deploy spacecraft as well. Nearby was a restaurant ('Home of the big G burger'), as well as a church (which could deploy its roof as a satellite dish). Also present are a geodesic dome and a large construction crane.
