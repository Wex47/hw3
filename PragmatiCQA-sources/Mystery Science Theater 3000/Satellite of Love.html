The Season One opener seemed to suggest that Joel was shoved into a rocket and sent to the Satellite of Love, but Season Two through Five's opener instead shows that Joel was already in the Satellite when it launched. In order to keep from going mad himself, Robinson built his robot friends from parts of the spacecraft — namely the controls used to begin and end the movie.
   Eventually, Gypsy found an escape pod in a box of

   However, some aspects can be determined from the episodes. Based on the opening sequence of season 10, where the crew is briefly seen looking out a window, the room where the host segments take place is on the bridge, which appears to be in the upper-right sphere of the dog-bone-shaped ship. The crew is able to communicate with

   (seasons 9-10) via a viewscreen of some sort (never shown on the TV series but shown in the movie), accessible through Cambot, which enables the crew to see the Mads and vice-versa. (For all intents and purposes, it was the actual television camera that served this purpose, since whenever one group was communicating with the other, they looked at and spoke directly to the viewer.) Another viewscreen, the

   Each of the SOL crew has his own living quarters, the locations of which are unclear. Mike's room was only seen once when the Bots were stalking him by putting a "hidden" camera on a toy.
   Servo's room is very messy, with underwear strewn about (Servo collects underwear), and contains a car-shaped bed.
   Crow's room has never been seen, nor has Gypsy's. It is unclear if Cambot had a room or if he simply lived on the bridge. From season 8 onward, the ship was also inhabited by billions of creatures called

   A few sightings include one instance of Mike and the Bots walking down the hallway,

   's direct passage before apparently being run over by Cambot himself — Joel and the Bots after a game of tag during the KTMA season,
   repeated in a later nationally telecast episode,
   and Mike alone after dislodging the stuck door in the season 10 opener.
   Given the sheer size of the SOL, it seems unlikely that the hallway extended entirely from one end of the ship to the other, given that Joel and Mike were able to run from bridge to theater in so short a time; however, if it didn't, precisely what was at the other end of the SOL was never revealed.

   During the Joel era, Joel was sometimes seen jumping into the "Spiral-on-Down"... a separate entrance beside the main door to get to the theater,
   In later seasons this opening would be changed to, among other things, an airlock leading outside the satellite.
   In a few episodes, this hatch allowed the characters to send things back and forth between the satellite and

   The Satellite of Love was so large that many regions of it went unexplored, at least by Mike, who, during season 10, was surprised to learn that the SOL was equipped with a squash court, a silo, and a feed lot.
   The presence of Joel's escape pod in "Docking Bay 14"
   implies there are at least fourteen docking bays. The Satellite even has its own time machine which is built by the nanites during the episode

   Another section, simply referred to as "the basement" by Tom Servo, is first featured in a scene where Crow attempts to "dig" his way back to Earth.
   This part of the ship is located directly beneath the bridge, and appears to contain various mechanical parts that keep the Satellite running. In season 8, Crow conducts an archaeological dig to uncover his forgotten 500-year solo occupation of the SOL since season 7.
   The SOL crew also discovers albinos living in this area that happen to resemble the light-deprived Sumerian descendants of
