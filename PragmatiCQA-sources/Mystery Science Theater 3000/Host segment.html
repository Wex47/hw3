   , or other venues.  Host segments are usually related to the movie in some way, from featuring a discussion about the film, movie characters dropping in to visit, or simply parodying what was seen in the theater.  Occasionally, sketches may have nothing to do with the film at all, making fun of whatever the

   wanted to at the time.

   There were generally six host segments featured in any given episode of MST3K.  The first would be the introduction inbetween the
   opening theme song
   and the first commercial break.  Following the break, the show returns into the first host segment.  Each host segment thereafter takes place one quarter, halfway, and three-quarters of the way through the show, with segments two and four before the commercial break, and segment three after.  There is then one final host segment that wraps everything up before the show goes to the credits and

   In the early days of the show, the host segments were written shortly before the show was filmed.  Since the writers had not seen the movies featured before and were ad-libbing the theater segments, the early host segments had little (if anything) to do with the featured movie.

  <p key="440df979-b4e2-46b0-b954-1d1ba457de0c">
   When the show moved to national TV and the writing practices changed, several types of segments became fairly common.  One of the most enduring was the musical-based sketches featuring the characters singing about things related to the movie.  These sketches became prevelent enough that the show was eventually able to create two CD collections of music called

  </p>
  <p key="96c59462-9278-4525-a910-c013e153896d">
   Later host segments were sometimes connected by a common storyline throughout the show, such as
   Crow's evil twin visiting
   ,
   Tom asking Gypsy on a date
   ,
   Frank getting fired
   , or
   the SOL crew entering a mirror universe
   .  The practice became especially common in the
   Sci-Fi Channel
   era.

   The final host segment played host to the tradition of reading fan letters, a practice that dated all the way back to the early days of the show.
