   It's far more dangerous than shooting wildlife," says Stonehouse with a laugh. "There are more explosions and things to dodge."

  <p key="bb0acad0-fce9-4fdc-8370-afd2cd1dcdc8">
   Stonehouse should know. In his career, he's used his talents shooting wildlife documentaries for PBS' Nova series (he graduated from the University of Minnesota with a dual degree in Zoology and Cinematography), and for NBC, recording the gymnastics competition at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, not to mention numerous commercials, promotional work and six music videos for the band The Fugees.

   As time went by, Stonehouse acknowledges that he "tried to make some of the visuals a bit less static. In the beginning, we only had one camera angle and we'd zoom in and zoom out. By the time we got to

   ,' and we try to keep that in mind," he explains. "I like to keep what I call a 'tactile' feel to the show. Most of our effects are done in camera, not generated later in editing. And we followed through on that when we finally shot the movie. Instead of generating a starfield in a computer, as most movies would do it these days, we had a huge piece of black material with little cutout stars on it."

  <p key="c21415e8-0683-4724-97b6-1d719c448aae">
   The movie really gave Stonehouse a chance to stretch. "We had to make the visuals more sophisticated for a theatrical audience, which for us meant that we could actually use different shots in one scene. It was a lot of fun."

   Stonehouse, who is married and has two daughters, says he looks forward to continuing with his favorite gig for a long time to come.
