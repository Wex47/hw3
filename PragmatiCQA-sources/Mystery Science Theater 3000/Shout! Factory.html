   coincided with the 20th anniversary of the original airing of the show; therefore, their first release was a spectacular celebration of the show. They have since resumed normal numbered releases, continuing their numbering where Rhino left off. Notably, Shout uses

   to number their sets. They have also released several previously-available episodes on individual DVDs and begun a program of re-issuing the original Rhino sets.
