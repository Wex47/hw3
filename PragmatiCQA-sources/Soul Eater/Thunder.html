   Thunder has a dark skin complexion and facial features consisting of large blue eyes, rosy cheeks and mid-length blonde hair framing her face. She also has clothes composed of a striped sleeveless top worn under white dungarees, and a cap. However, Thunder's cap is yellow and her top features alternating yellow and white stripes.

   's magic, Thunder can enter her Earth Shaman form. Thunder becomes a young girl dressed in a (probably) yellow crop top which is attached to a hood that goes over her head and hangs down and curves round in a loop, with some segments of the hood separated and floating in place. She seems to wear a hat beneath the hood. Possibly yellow markings can be seen on the edges of her eyes and short streaks can be seen beneath them. She has two sleek yellow lines tattooed on her shoulder. She wears elaborate decorative sleeves that extend outward and curve into the air similar to her hood, with some parts floating detached.

  </h2>
  <p key="a452bb63-57eb-4794-9e1d-12267612e09c">
   Not much is known about the personality of Thunder and how she differs from her twin brother, Fire. Both are inquisitive and easily distracted. More often than not, they do not realize that they are supposed to be serious in some situations, and always remain playful and innocent. They share Kilik's carefree and laid back attitude to most things, and are always cheerful and looking for fun. They are surprisingly tough for their age, and do not show fear when fighting with Kilik. However, they can still be spooked when things get too violent, which causes them to cry and run to Kilik or the nearest person for protection, which show that they are still heavily dependent on others and are defenseless on their own.
  </p>
  <p key="2deed76a-04e0-45fd-a1c5-3db06d3e0c8f">
   Much like normal siblings, they quarrel a lot and can be impatient, no matter how serious the situation is. This is shown during the operation to capture
   Baba Yaga Castle
   against
   Arachnophobia
   . In conducting this mission they nearly ruin Kilik's disguise in front of
   <a href="Mosquito.html" key="611d6427-2ef7-4be7-9a8b-7a3c8e6d52e9" title="Mosquito">

   , through arguing while still being an integral part of the disguise. Also, due to their playfulness, they easily fall under the influence of Demon Tool Soldier Morubi's technique.
  </p>
  <p key="e7229f99-3632-41ac-9610-0980a3d7e488">
   Despite these setbacks, Fire and Thunder are actually quite serious at times, especially when it comes to their abilities as Earth Shamans. They have deep ties to nature and are shown to express concern, even sadness, when they feel nature's pain from being polluted. Their feelings can be quite intense if nature is heavily affected by something, which may make them emotional in some situations.
  </p>
  <p key="ab2e8721-5f6c-41de-94ef-aa592b39d006">
   Due to their young age, they do not speak. Being rather in sync with each other, there are not that many differences in their individual personalities.

Impressed by his spirit, Kilik offers him to go with him on his mission, the mission that requires a burning heart and spirit. Ox agrees and take their mission to the receptionist, who super-approves their mission.

   Fire and Thunder are seen at DWMA with Kilik, Ox and Harvar. All of them have their shirts off. When Soul and Maka ask them why they are not wearing shirts, Kilik explains their story of how they went about with their mission, which was to quell the rage of a giant. Kilik and Ox had gone against the giant in a stand-off, whilst Harvar, Fire and Thunder had sat and watched. In the end however, they had ended up befriending the giant, and had all danced around naked around a camp fire. Soon Jacqueline and Kim return and Jacqueline and Maka fuss over the twins, until DWMA officials try to take Kim and Jacqueline away. Realizing that the DWMA had discovered that she is a Witch, Kim and Jacqueline quickly run away before explanations can be made.

Fire and Thunder suddenly begin to loudly weep, to Maka's surprise. Kilik proceeds to explain that 'nature is crying' and that the grief inflicted upon the land due to magical contamination is being directly transmitted to the young children because of their Earth Shaman heritage. As Maka comforts the two, Medusa suggests that the sound of the Earth will probably sound like the babbling of children, as she cannot imagine the Earth's voice as anything else. This causes Soul to throw a snide comment at her, and he asks how Medusa can say such kind things after she had ruined the world by releasing

Medusa proposes to dissemble this protection using her magic and follow it up with a powerful attack. With that, she enhances Fire and Thunder with

However, Ox senses Kim and with persuasion from Kilik , goes on ahead to find her with Harvar. Kilik and the twins go on alone to find the Lock. However, Kilik's cover is nearly blown once again, when the twins start violently arguing between themselves but due to their resemblance to Artifact Soldiers, the deception is preserved. Kilik ends up in a room full of Artifact Soldiers. As he senses the explosions of the other Locks being destroyed, he decides to abandon his disguise and fight his way to the Lock.

   Morubi

The twins completely ignore Kilik being chased around by the Artifact Soldiers, being completely taken in by Morubi's entertaining actions. It is not until Harvar appears and kills Morubi right in front of them that they stop playing. They then run to Kilik, terrified by Harvar. As Kilik and the twins reunite with Ox, Harvar, Jacqueline and Kim, they soon go on to destroy the Lock, opening up the door to the Queen Spider's Room. This is the last time the twins are seen in this arc.

   On their first mission as part of DWMA's elite unit, Spartoi, they are tasked with the locating of certain materials supported by Kilik, Liz and Patti, with Kim and Jacqueline stationed nearby. The operation has lead the group into a seemingly desolate village within Africa, and they are infiltrating one of Medusa's abandoned laboratories in order to gather information of her plans. Through the use of the Demon Tool Income, constant contact is maintained between them and Yumi Azusa, the Death Scythe in charge of the mission. Yumi advises Kilik to use Fire and Thunder for close-range and the Thompson sisters for long-range combat. As they continue through the town, Fire and Thunder proceed to alert the others to their discovery of an underground passageway, that they are able to detect due to their Earth Shaman powers. The group cautiously descend down the darkened stairs, with the twins assuming their Weapon forms in preparation for any traps.

  <p key="334ddffe-a871-4ef7-8284-66b1efba3692">
   After entering the laboratory, they gather the information, and the team exits the hidden structure only to be attacked by numerous crazed locals of the village. Because of them being fired on by guns, Kilik mostly fights using Liz and Patti, whilst Fire and Thunder retain their Weapon form, as Kilik evades the multiple assaults directed towards them, only using the Pots to eventually smash through a solid wall in order to conduct an escape.

   Later, at a more secure location, the twins are seen playing with Pattyas the reunited group contemplate on the meaning of the research they have gathered and its relation to the situation in the village. While this occurs, the Black Clown appears. Fire and Thunder are immediately aware of the Clown's presence. They, along with Liz, Pattyand Jacqueline assume Weapon form as Kim and Kilik prepare to fight the Clown. After overcoming the Wavelength of madness coming from the creature, they engage in battle. Kilik now starts using the Demon Pots more than the Thompson sisters, engaging in close combat. Kim covers Kilik by getting rid of the Black Blood emitted from the Black Clown so it cannot counter-attack.

   But the Black Clown is fairly resilient, and Kilik and the others fail to do damage. They decide to use a Chain Resonance. Kim passes on her magic to Fire and Thunder, awakening their true Earth Shaman powers, causing them to assume their adult forms. Fire and Thunder take hold of Liz and Pattyin Weapon form and fire two huge blasts at the Clown, resulting in the attack, E3. The Black Clown, heavily damaged, retreats before Kilik and the others realize that it is still alive. Kilik and the others decide that the Black Clown is destroyed.

The Index explains to them that everyone must traverse the seven Chapters of the Book in order to reach Kid. Everyone agrees to go on, and enter a portal into the first Chapter, Lust. Here, everyone has their genders switched, each person transformed into a manifestation of what they find sexually attractive in the opposite sex. Amusingly, Fire and Thunder look completely identical to each other, even when their genders are switched. The twins fidget, obviously embarrassed and confused as to what has happened.

Fire and Thunder were given a racehorse name, called Fire Thunder. Their popularity level was 14.
