Upon meeting Medusa, Kilik is not hesitant to express his strong dislike for Witches.

   During their travel, while trekking through the Amazon River Basin which is where Arachne's base is located, the team is attacked by a squid-like creature in a river that has been affected by the magic of Arachne. The team prepares to attack the beast but, despite all their efforts, all their attacks seem in vain, as the creature is covered by a protective magic coating. Medusa proposes to disassemble the coating with her magic and follow it up with a powerful attack. With that, she enhances Kirikou's
   Pot of Fire
   and
   Pot of Thunder
   with her

   As they enter an underground path into the castle, they are soon greeted with the presence of one of Medusa's underlings, Eruka, who brings several Arachnophobia uniforms for the crew to disguise themselves with. Kilik shares a cloak with Fire and Thunder, who sit atop his head. However, after properly infiltrating the castle, their group realizes that everyone around them is wearing the same cloak and mask uniform of Arachnophobia, and soon get separated from one another as they cannot tell each other apart. Kilik and his partners, Harvar and Ox end up with Mosquito. Kilik is almost found out by Mosquito as Fire and Thunder fight with each other in the cloak, but luckily, Mosquito only mistakes him for a special
   Demon Tool Soldier
   . Soon after, Kilik, to his relief, is reunited with everyone.

Fire and Thunder continuously fighting on his head almost gives him away, but once again, he is mistaken for a special Demon Tool Soldier, and ends up in a room with dozens of them. With his disguise, he fits in normally with the rest. However, as many of the other Locks are destroyed, he tires of waiting and decides to shed his disguise among the Demon Tool Soldiers. He uses both of the Vector Boosts that Medusa had given him, destroying the majority of his enemies. He is met by various specially modified Demon Tool Soldiers, such as
   one programmed with various martial arts techniques
   and
   one that can read his next twenty moves
   . He manages to defeat them all, but the last Demon Tool Soldier,
   Morubi

He realizes that Harvar is the only one in their team who is not affected, and states that it is because Harvar is 'dry to a fault.' However, as Soul spreads Maka's
   Anti-Demon Wavelength

  <p key="59137405-fe21-425e-a153-7bfa2f32d509">
   Azusa Yumi quickly briefs them on the mission. Kilik is meant to infiltrate Medusa's laboratory to search for Medusa's written research texts. Once found, Azusa Yumi will copy the texts down by using her Thousand-Mile Eyes to see through Kilik's eyes. Since the text will be written in unintelligible Witch language, Azusa Yumi would then transmit the images of the copied texts to Kim Diehl, who is flying up above, who will be able to translate the text since she is a Witch. She recommends Kilik to be on guard as she does not know whether Medusa is in the nearby area or not. She tells him to use Fire and Thunder for close-range combat, and Liz and Patty for long-range. Since Kilik has advanced Soul Wavelength compatibility abilities, he should have no problem in switching between the two.

  <p key="7bd1b734-bc9f-4a57-8ea4-e98807356e91">
   As Kilik discusses the usefulness of the
   Incoms
   with the Thompson sisters, Fire and Thunder proceed to alert him to their discovery of an underground passageway. The group cautiously descend down the darkened stairs, with the majority assuming their Weapon forms in preparation, entering a laboratory containing a collection of various mysterious items. Continuing the infiltration, Kilik, despite the distraction of many bad puns from Liz and Patty, locates the intended papers and allows Azusa Yumi to view them through the use of her Thousand-Mile Eyes.

   After the successful completion of the mission, Kilik exits the hidden structure only to be momentarily blinded under the blazing sun. As his vision returns, he notices the presence of numerous villagers and proceeds to explain that he is from the DWMA. However, the statement does not have the intended effect, as Kilik suddenly comes under fire. His fast reactions combined with a well-timed leap, allow him to evade the barrage of bullets, but confronted by crazed innocents he has little choice than to take cover. Kilik does not have much time to rest though, as almost immediately his position is compromised. After a brief discussion with Azusa Yumi about the current situation and seeing no other option, Kilik returns fire using the Thompson sisters, making sure their bullets are regulated to non-lethal levels. He quickly incapacitates the frontal attackers but a sudden
   Molotov cocktail
   from the rear forces him to leap between the small alley's walls and continue along the rooftops. Instantaneously, shots from an
   AK-47
   hammer the area but a well executed dive roll prevents any damage. As this occurs, an
   RPG
   is directed towards him, exploding and knocking him back some distance. This action provokes Kirikou into communicating with

   for immediate evacuation but the attackers prevent this, so he once again flees, this time jumping through a lower window of the adjacent building. It is at this point that Azusa Yumi assumes control and dictates Kilik's next movements, resulting in him punching through a solid wall, just in time to catch
   Jacqueline
   's Weapon form. Everyone manages to fly to safety.

  <p key="a361ddda-6f85-4b6d-aecb-b3d977728528">
   Later, at a more secure location, the reunited group contemplate on the meaning of the research they have gathered and how it is related to their encounter with the crazed villagers. They deduct that Medusa is researching a way to control madness. However, the critical texts were missing in the laboratory, so in the end, Kilik thinks that they have found out nothing. While they are conversing, the
   Black Clown
   appears and the team lose contact with Azusa Yumi.

  <p key="8f49fcd9-920a-4aad-bd4e-37720f3a56b9">
   Kilik immediately orders Liz, Patty, Fire, and Thunder to transform and for Kim and Jacqueline to back him up. Before he can begin the battle, he notices that his skin is seemingly liquidating and dropping to the floor. Kim compares the phenomenon to the kind of madness used by Arachne. Kilik focuses his mind and manages to break free from the illusion, pulls out the Thompson sisters and begins to shoot down the Black Clown. He switches to Fire and Thunder as the Clown comes closer, and he connects a punch. The released blood from the creature forms into numerous needles, and the Clown uses

   , but Kilik safely evades. While his mind is on the Bloody Needle attack, the very same attack forms again but the blood is incinerated by Jacqueline's fire. Kim promises to take care of any counter-attacks from the Black Clown, and tells Kilik to attack it as much as he can.

  <p key="5e19d0c7-f8eb-4417-aab2-d935729b51c4">
   Numerous kicks and punches later, the Clown stops releasing

    Black Blood

   and relies on close combat. Kilik blocks the attacks and counters while Kim burns the Black Clown using
   Volantern
   . Kilik soon realizes that his attacks will not affect the creature. He retreats, while evading all the

    Vector Arrows

   thrown at him from the Clown. He performs a Soul Resonance with Kim, who sends her magic to Fire and Thunder to awaken their
   Earth Shaman
   abilities. Once the twins transform into their mature adult forms, they each subsequently take hold of one of the Thompson sisters in their Weapon forms, producing visible manifestations of their elemental powers from the barrels of the guns. Kilik then proceeds to state the name of the attack,
   E3
   , signaling the twins to take aim and fire. A large beam emanates from both guns, travelling rapidly towards the Clown, which, upon impact, intermingle and create a massive explosion. This attack destroys most of the Black Clown, leaving only its head on the floor. As the team manage to contact Azusa Yumi again, Kilik proclaims the battle is over as the Black Clown disappears.

The Table of Contents explains that Death the Kid is in the seventh Chapter of the book, and to reach him, they would have to traverse through all seven Chapters in the book, with each one having its own dangers.

   The Table of Contents acknowledges their determination and sends them on to the first Chapter, Lust, where everyone has their genders switched, taking on the form of their idea of a perfect sexual partner. Kilik is transformed into a girl in a female Spartoi uniform, and adopts a more serious, female-like personality. As the
   Succubus
   appears, the 'male' members of the team (who are originally female) begin to be allured by the creature's sexual appeal. Since he is now female, Kilik is not affected, and expresses dismay as the others are distracted. He then notices Blair, seeing that she does not look different at all in her cat form. However, in human form, Blair reveals to have changed into a strikingly handsome young man. The Succubus immediately falls for Blair, and the magic cat uses the opportunity to blast the creature away using her

   As the team continue on to the next Chapter, Gluttony, everyone realizes that even though they had left the Lust Chapter, they are still in their opposite genders, although their personalities have returned to normal. The Table of Contents explains that they will change back to their original form after leaving the Lust Chapter, and that the speed of the transformation depends on the individual's sexual desire: the stronger the desire, the slower the transformation. Kilik takes this in rather light-heartedly, stating, 'I guess we'll find out who's the horniest among us, eh? Should be interesting.' Tsubaki fervently argues that it is not.

Black☆Star slices off one of the pig's arms, and Kilik fries it with Pot of Thunder, before taking a bite out of the roast meat. Black☆Star slices up the rest of the pig, and Kilik fries the pieces again. He gorges on the meat alongside Black☆Star and Patty.

The chapter ends up aggravating everyone, making them all fly into a rage.
