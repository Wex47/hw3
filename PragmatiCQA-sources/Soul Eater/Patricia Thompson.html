  <p key="bcfe6573-aea2-44f1-ac6d-1b61b25aba58">
   Patty acts and speaks like a young child, often using a singsong voice. She pronounces words like "hello" and "sorry", as a child would "hullo" and "sowwy", and seems to still be learning about simple things such as assigning animal noises to the right animal.
   This child-like disposition can lead to her coming across as nosy or insensitive, such as when she boldly asks if Crona is a boy or a girl .
   However, concepts past extremely basic ones may not have been explained to her due to her generally childish demeanour and inability to understand a lot of things, as exemplified by Liz congratulating her on simply getting animal names right.
   This lack of knowledge may be due to her growing up on the streets and presumably not having a formal education.
  </p>
  <p key="3537f99d-75fd-40f2-8a36-649d622d72cb">
   Her current personality differs from the seemingly aggressive personality she had during her time in Brooklyn, developing her current personality after she met Kid. Unlike her sister Liz, Patty enjoys the drama brought on by Kid's perfectionist attitude; though she does cheer him up when he gets down on himself about it.
  </p>
  <p key="14a6c187-fe14-49e2-abde-d2163e5fe1a3">
   She seems naïve and simple-minded, seeming not to take life seriously. While Patty had these traits before moving to Death City, such as being delighted that Kid referred to her and Liz as beautiful
   or patting her backside at people she robbed,
   such simplemindedness was far more violent and nefarious. With time working at
   Deathbucks Café
   , Patty would spend off-time building a dragon sculpture out of napkins and frightening

   , instead of answering questions, Patty took out crayons and began making an origami giraffe out of her test papers, then "broke its neck." When showering, she scrubs so much shampoo through her hair that she forms suds all over her body.
   She also seems fascinated by the smallest details, such as children's alphabet books
   or a hairclip.
   She frequently laughs, even when something bad happens. For example, when Kid bemoans his asymmetry and says he "want[s] to die," Patty responds with laughter: "Kya ha ha! ♪"
   and, at other times when he is depressed, even poking him with a stick.
  </p>
  <p key="e2f30317-489e-4cac-9c37-55923bcf7d28">
   On the few occasions when she loses her temper, her childlike personality is replaced by an almost insane anger, as if her personality returns to how she behaved when a criminal in Brooklyn. Her demeanor can be so frightening that it scares Kid, even to the point of risking running through an asymmetric
   Tadpole Bomb
   minefield. Whether these qualities count as her own form of madness has yet to be clarified.
  </p>
  <p key="55a14edc-feae-474a-86ed-29061bc13663">
   When confronting some serious topics, and dangerous situations, Patty's childishly naïve personality is replaced with a more serious personality, suggesting that her bubbly personality may be a mask or merely how she wants to act. Upon learning that

   . She has chin-length, bright blonde hair with bangs and light blue eyes. Liz is taller and thinner than Patty: upon their arrival in Death City, Liz is 170 centimeters tall (about 5 feet 7 inches), and Patty is 160 centimeters (about 5 feet 3 inches).
   Patty's breasts are large also much more in size than her sister, despite being the younger sister of the two, and these and other physical differences between the sisters annoy their meister, Kid, as it makes the sisters asymmetrical in their human form.

  <p key="a09da0fb-f244-4b76-b197-1f596731fff6">

Patty and Liz collect the souls by drawing them into the pistol's magazine, and they fired a meister's compressed wavelength rather than bullets, such compressed wavelengths appearing pink as they fire.

   When living on the streets of New York, Patty wore a sleeveless top with thin straps, and pants with a worn-out spot on the right knee.
   When Kid offered to take her and Liz as his weapon partners, she wore a sleeveless top with a buttoned collar and jeans.

   After finishing their shift, Patty along with her hang outside the cafe and spot the trio they served earlier. Both of them take the opportunity to pick on Anya, having picked up on her wealthy background based on her dress. Backing the three into a corner in an alleyway, Patty is present as Liz challenges all three of them as well as insult them. When Anya accepts the challenge, Patty is the one who transforms into her weapon form.

Citing that they're not fighting on equal footing, Patty shoots and intentionally misses.

   As Liz complains how they are doing their best, she and Patty are approached by Tsugumi. As the Thompsons are confused why Tsugumi keeps returning to the cafe, Tsugumi explains that she is indeed afraid of the sisters, but she still admires their strength, considering them to be cool and beautiful, which impresses, even embarrasses, Patty and Liz. Supporting Tsugumi's point, new customers arrive who, despite knowing the Thompsons' poor service, are interested to see such attractive waitresses. Master then supports Tsugumi's point, reassuring Patty and Liz that they do not have to pretend to be nice or be tough because people in Death City are understanding, focused not on external appearances but on the soul itself.

Patty reminds her sister that bombs are already dangerous, hence Kid's fear is rational. Liz asks Patty to assume her "voice of authority": Patty assumes a frightening face and tells the "good-for-nothing" Kid to move it. Motivated by Patty's harsh words, Kid, in tears, rides along Beelzebub through the bombs, setting them off such that their blasts actually propel him at a faster pace. As Patty cackles with delight, the teary-eyed Kid insults her for being such "a moron."

Kid sees the flash of light and dodges in time, but the cannon fire blasts through the ruins, the resulting explosion knocking Kid and Beelzebub down.

Therefore, he tries to keep his distance and fire at Free with

The solution comes in the form of Black☆Star, armed with Tsubaki, who in his excitement at catching up to Kid ends up kicking him. After Liz distracts Kid by pointing out that Free is asymmetrical as well—only his left leg is attached to a ball and chain—she and Patty are overjoyed as Kid renews his determination to stop Free.

When Kid shakes off the illusion, he continues to fire upon Free with Patty and Liz.

   As Asura regains his footing and attempts to resume a more human form, Black☆Star attempts to fight back, without Tsubaki. Witnessing Black☆Star's willingness to fight, Kid orders the Thompsons to join this battle, Patty sounding more enthusiastic than Liz. When Asura easily disables Black☆Star and Kid with just flicks of his skin scarves, Patty and Liz can only watch helplessly along with Tsubaki. Patty and the other weapons then witness the arrival of Maka, wielding Soul, who attempts to leap at Asura, who escaping by flying out through the ceiling. Maka holds onto Asura's scarves and is pulled above ground, eventually knocked unconscious. As Asura escapes Death City, even tearing through Death himself, all Patty and Liz can do is return to human form and, with Tsubaki, retrieve Kid and Black☆Star to provide medical care and bring home.

While Maka is annoyed, as she does not know how to play basketball, Patty removes her cap and puts it on Maka's head. Their classmates suggest a bet: whichever team loses will have their captain face a punishment, Kid having a painting made asymmetrical at Gallows Mansion, and Maka having to go on a father-daughter outing with

   Later, Patty gathers with other members of Spartoi: Liz, Maka, Soul, Black☆Star, Tsubaki, Kilik, Fire, and Thunder, as well as Blair in cat form. They are transported into the Book of Eibon manuscript by the witches Kim, Risa, Arisa, and Eruka Frog, recently captured by Black☆Star and Tsubaki.

   Upon entering the Book, Patty and her teammates meet the Table of Contents, who offers to guide them to Kid’s location, in the book’s Hidden Section. However, it warns her that this hidden section houses "the onset of madness," and to enter will require "paying a price." Patty, along with Kilik and Tsubaki, claim that they understand these risks and are willing to do what is necessary to save Kid.
  </p>
  <p key="33b445f9-9b45-434d-abc1-2b81f77e9aa0">
   The Table of Contents speaks in an unknown language to open a portal to the book's first chapter, Lust. Inside, Patty and her teammates have their sexes changed, men becoming women, and women becoming men, all appearing in accordance with which characteristics they find appealing in that sex. Patty has shorter hair covered by a beanie hat. She also resembles her past psychotic self a bit more, as her eyes look slightly more crazed. She also wears a white jacket and shirt and dark pants like Liz, differing in that Patty's has the Spartoi logo on her left shoulder and a large

   In the Lust Chapter, Patty is impressed how "bad ass” Liz now looks. After saying she and Liz have not changed much, Patty expresses desire "to start kickin' some major ass." Patty grabs The Table of Contents, intending to punch the contraption. Liz then notices something moving within the twisted structures around them. Liz clutches Patty, who thinks Liz looks humorous as a man when so frightened. From the curtains, the
   Succubus
   emerges. Patty and Liz mock their teammates’ reactions to the Succubus, until both Patty and Liz too become enamored by the Succubus as well. They escape thanks to Blair attacking the Succubus and the Table of Contents opening a new portal.

   In the next chapter, Gluttony, Patty and Black☆Star notice the wonderful smells of dumplings, soups, and other meals. Patty and Black☆Star enter one restaurant and begin eating all the food that they can find, ignoring Tsubaki's warnings. As they eat, Patty and Black☆Star are confronted by the
   pig
   , who says it will test the mettle of their souls, as it slices at the two with a cleaver. Shocked to face a pig that desires to cut, cook, and consume these students (and is naked under just an apron), Patty and Black☆Star wield Liz and Tsubaki (as Patty realizes Liz feels the same in gun form despite her change of sex, as Liz says guns are clunky regardless of gender). Realizing that they can eat the pig, Patty and Black☆Star, along with Kilik, kill and consume the pig, becoming more and more mad for food. Soul orders the Table of Contents to transport them out of the Gluttony Chapter.

  <p key="0693fe44-4bac-47b7-b94c-f56f9cce0c74">
   Upon transportation, the team is separated: Maka and Soul are sent to the Envy Chapter, while Patty and the rest are sent to the Wrath Chapter.
   Patty, as well as Black☆Star and Kilik, are back to their previous sexes, while Liz, Tsubaki, and Blair are still male. Patty, Black☆Star, and Kilik are furious: they are hungry, and she cannot stand Black☆Star and Kilik's complaining. Patty, Black☆Star, and Kilik also call Liz a "horny-ass cougar" and a "typical blonde" with a "goddamn hissy fit.” Patty and Black☆Star then demand that the noise stop. But her fury only increases as the other captive of the Wrath Chapter is revealed:
   Excalibur
   . The Table of Contents explains it cannot conjure an escape from Excalibur so long as the Holy Sword keeps interrupting his incantation. Patty, Black☆Star, and Kilik, infuriated, promise to distract the Holy Sword. But as the three try to grab Excalibur, the weapon leaps away, thinking the three are wasting time with a game. As the three yell that it is Excalibur wasting time, The Table of Contents completes its message, causing the Wrath Chapter to flip to the next chapter.

  <p key="a25c1f51-e3c4-43e4-abf4-cfd42b1a5610">
   Unfortunately, Excalibur follows Patty and her teammates into the Pride Chapter, cause her to freak out more. Excalibur offers to help them escape, offering himself to Liz as the
   Holy Sword
   to slice out of the Pride Chapter and to Kid in the Hidden Section. When Liz is too prideful to complete the task, instead throwing Excalibur out of the Book and back to the Eternal Cave, Patty and the rest tell Liz not to worry over her mistake.

  <p key="b585103c-f3d0-417d-b31d-cd3d4dd2f5ff">
   The team then is transported by the Table of Contents to the Greed Chapter, where Patty continues to mock Liz and Tsubaki for still being men, which means they are "nymphos.” When Tsubaki is the last to transform into a woman again, Liz joins Patty in mocking Tsubaki. Tsubaki responds by holding a kunai threateningly at the Thompsons.

   In the Greed Chapter, a portal opens near Patty’s feet, welcoming Black☆Star to enter to battle and retrieve Kid, now suffering from the madness of the

   Meanwhile, in the Hidden Section, Black☆Star, also suffering the same madness as Kid, still manages to remind Kid that his plan to destroy all existence is absurd: would Kid also sacrifice the lives of Patty and Liz for this symmetry of nothingness?

   Back in the Greed Chapter, Liz remembers how she and Patty first met Kid, and how he saved them from thugs. Instead of destroying/capturing them, like he was sent to do, he asked them to be his weapon partners and gave them a chance to redeem themselves. She and Patty had been planning on using Kid's Shinigami status to gain the money and power they craved, believing he was just a spoiled brat. However, the more time they spent with Kid, the more they grew to care for him, a fact Liz realizes after watching Patty laugh herself to tears.

   It begins to rain money down on the group, and Liz thinks to herself that she doesn't care about money, all she wants is for Kid and Black☆Star to return safely. Patty and Tsubaki ask if she's ok, and she begins to cry, saying "I haven't thanked him yet." Both girls simply smile and pull her into a hug. Liz says "Kid" and begins crying more openly and is shaking.

Death asks Patty, along with Liz and Jacqueline, to stay behind so not to provoke the Witches.

After placing the armband on his left bicep, he impresses Patty and Liz—until he collapses in panic over the need to be "neat and tidy."

Kid admits he may be naive, yet ideals must be realized, and if giving up his ideals is what must be done to be an adult, then he would rather live up to his name and remain a kid. Kid reminds Azusa that there are 36 members currently on the Airship. Kid promises that, if anyone opposes his plan, he will call off the attack. But Patty and everyone else, including eventually Azusa, agree to follow Kid. With that, the team announces "full speed ahead!"

   As Kid flies back, Patty sees the tooth fall out of the Moon's mouth, then asks whether it was one of the Moon's baby teeth, while Liz worries the Moon will need dentures before Kid admonishes his weapons to focus on returning to Maka and Black☆Star.
   Along this flight, Maka and Spirit manage to reach Crona, which allows Asura to reassert control and swallow Crona.
   Kid finally approaches the Moon's mouth. While Patty and Liz complain that this third trip to the Moon is "not so special anymore," Kid senses Asura's wavelength. Wielding Patty and Liz, lands alongside Maka and Black☆Star and tells Asura that he has "come to settle the score in my father's stead."

   But Patty and others are then shocked to hear Asura refer to Kid as his "brother," identifying them as both fragments of Death. Patty and Liz begin to notice the physical resemblance between the brothers. Having connected
   his first and second Lines of Sanzu
   to transform Patty and Liz into
   Death Eagle .42

   Later, Asura manages to fire a laser directly at Black☆Star's face. The ninja manages to swallow the laser and fire it back at Asura. While his friends are amazed, Black☆Star proclaims that he can do anything a god may do—except he speaks in such a roundabout way that he confuses Patty and Liz.

   Kid then aims Patty and Liz at Asura, but his scarves slice across his shoulders. Furious to then see his friends under attack, Kid flies towards Asura, shooting multiple rounds from Patty and Liz. While Kid manages to recover and remains in flight, he looks pained, worried that, should he awaken his full shinigami abilities, he will become like Asura. When Maka loudly disagrees, assuring Kid that he is kind and that friends like Patty know him better than anyone else, Kid is shocked at her belief in him. Patty and Liz call to Kid to join the battle already. Kid flies up behind Maka and Black☆Star to thank them. Patty and their friends agree that Asura is no true shinigami, and only Kid can be one, as demonstrated by the witches’ faith in him. Patty and Liz see the third Line of Sanzu about to connect, until a vertical line of energy to light up the sky with an explosion, with three levels of radial energy expanding from this line. Patty now sees Kid fully transformed, able to control his Madness of Order and prove that, unlike Asura, he will not abuse his power because he has faith in humanity.

   Kid flies towards Asura, firing upon him with Patty and Liz from close distance. But even Kid's attack cannot stop Asura as he blasts Maka, Black☆Star, and Kid away with a shot of his power into the Moon's surface, temporarily immobilizing the meisters and their weapons. Later, Maka is stabbed through the chest by Asura, recovering through Black Blood to unlock her new powers, the Grigori Dress.

   Maka then asks Black☆Star and Kid to immobilize Asura long enough for her to enter him and remove Crona from inside. Kid fires Patty and Liz at Asura, but Asura still knocks him and the other meisters down to the Moon, immobilized again. Asura’s cackling provides a sufficient distraction for Kid to fire Patty and Liz again, helping to give Maka enough time to slice into Asura and enter with Soul to find Crona inside.

   With Maka and Soul inside to find Crona, Kid continues to use Patty and Liz’s shots to distract Asura while Maka and Soul search for Crona. Inside Asura’s soul, Maka and Soul can sense the souls of Patty and others. Upon discovering Crona, Maka and Soul are shocked that they refuse to leave, intending to use BREW and Black Blood to trap themselves and Asura and therefore protect the word. Soul then uses the souls of Patty and everyone else in the world to trace a path out of Asura. Asura realizes Crona’s plan, attempting to seal the wound before Maka and Soul can escape. Maka calls to Patty and their teammates to commence a Chain Resonance that allows her and Soul’s escape and begins the geyser of Black Blood from Asura's body, beginning to seal him, and Crona, on the Moon.

   Maka then senses and informs Patty and the others that these allies were teleported off the Moon. She follows their souls to the DWMA, where Patty and the others discover they are safe.

   At the coronation of Kid as the new Shinigami, Patty and Liz are surprised how long it takes Kid to be satisfied with having his mask bestowed onto him, symmetrically. Hearing Kid’s call for humans and witches to work together for a “stronger world,” Patty and Liz clutch hands and celebrate.
