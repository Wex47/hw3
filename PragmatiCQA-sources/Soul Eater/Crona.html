  </h2>
  <p key="28cef85f-a796-4b25-8971-0719c3bfb2b7">
   Described by Franken Stein and his Soul Perception to have an "introverted" personality,
   Crona is pessimistic and doesn't hold a high opinion of themselves.
   Due to being raised by Medusa Gorgon, they are extremely negative as well as nervous and submissive most of the time, playing a part of their bullying from Ragnarok.
   Possessing a great amount of shyness, Crona cites they're unable to "deal" with many things, whether it pertains to a situation, an action, or a specific individual. This causes them to complete shut themselves down from their surroundings.
  </p>
  <p key="dd1261b1-7e53-4375-9ccb-ea344c96d148">
   Perhaps what makes Crona a dangerous enemy is their unbalance state of mind and inclination to insanity (Madness mindset). This unbalanced state of mind originates from not only the influence of the Black Blood's Madness, but namely the abuse they suffered from the likes of both Ragnarok and Medusa as she drilled and tortured them into learning the ability to kill. Because of this, Crona is subjected to showing signs of insanity and aggression, spouting senseless comments and laughing at random moments
   This level of abuse has caused them to gain a warped objective of attempting to become an
   <a href="Kishin.html" key="5e8d04fd-6187-47e4-b3d6-26043ae92645" title="Kishin">
    Kishin
   </a>
   in an attempt to be able to "deal" with any given subject as well as fulfill Medusa's goal and gain not only her acceptance and love but to avoid being abandoned by their parent.
   Of their own admittance, Crona doesn't understand the concept of morality.
  </p>
  <p key="ec53025e-5148-4503-b293-3d6694d187b6">
   After meeting Maka and their enrollment into the DWMA, Crona stated showing more positive traits and was capable of feeling the need to protect Maka, who was previously their enemy.
   Their placement within Death City and DWMA caused Crona to become relaxed and happy in demeanor.
   Much of this development was lost due to some sort of amnesia when Medusa re-integrated their Madness mindset after capturing them back into her ranks.
   However, Crona gained much of themselves after Medusa's passing and capture by Asura, reflecting on their actions and finding it unforgivable. In a final heroic turn, Crona even opted to seal themselves with the Asura with the usage of the Black Blood and
   "BREW"
   for the sake of Maka as well as the entire world.
   <b key="903cd08b-2276-47e4-a07e-7d32deb6c654">
    In the anime
   </b>
   , their re-integration of their Madness mindset doesn't take place as Crona developed enough confidence within themselves to come to terms of Medusa's incapability to unconditionally love, recognize her cruelty and rebuke it, and even integrate themselves into DWMA's school culture.
  </p>
  <p key="008454b6-db71-4525-b7b0-61512f5f0897">
   Crona themselves possess some quirks. Their negativity has enough "destructive power" to write a
   poem
   able to evoke others to regretting their existence, even those as obnoxious as

    Black☆Star
   </a>
   or the undead like Sid.
   Crona also has the tendency to redundantly remind others of having Black Blood in battle. Due to their shy and nervous personality, Crona has a knack for naming parts of rooms such as "Roomsky Kornerkov" (Mr. Corner in the anime)
   as well as having shuffling footsteps in general.

   Physically, Crona possess an androgynous appearance with a thin body, pink hair, lavender eyes, and tall stature. Their hair is quite short with several long, large clumps, bangs straight-cut and end above the eyebrows, but do not stay very uniform. Two long pieces of hair extend from the bangs and hang low over Crona's face
  </p>
  <p key="3a44a078-86c1-4898-a938-9890a1c30cc0">
   Crona's attire consists of a long black old-style robe that is tight-fitting and ends at the mid-calf level on their legs. The robe is completed with large white cuff-links at the ends of each sleeve and a tall white button-up collar at the neck. Black slipper-like shoes with a tall white cuff protruding out of the top are also worn.For formal occasions, Crona wears a white suit: the suit is very plain, with long pants, a coat with long sleeves and a collar. The coat appears to fasten at the front and back.
  </p>
  <p key="62052cc6-4926-42cd-bbc6-e0b66604b9f5">
   Crona's soul in hitomi form appears as a normal, lighly colored soul. When expanding, the soul appears in a darker tone.

   As a child, Crona wore a black knee-high dress. The dress has a rugged cut-out at the bottom, laced with several white diamonds. Like the present-day clothing, the childhood design also has a white collar and cuffs. The shoes stay relatively the same, as well. Crona's hair is shorter and simpler in this stage, but overall the same design. Also, Crona possessed large pupils.

When Maka becomes paralyzed due to the mysterious webs coming out of the wound, Crona jumps in to protect her when Giriko tries to kill her, only to have the both of them slammed into some brick trees.

Unfortunately, Giriko quickly gains the upper hand as he came close to decapitating Crona until Death Scythe

Black☆Star is reluctant to attack Crona since they still consider them a friend, but Maka knows that not doing anything means that nothing will change. So with Black☆Star, Tsubaki and Soul helping her while her Dad promises not to interfere, Maka bravely states to Crona that she will strike them until the Crona they knew from the academy until Medusa took them away comes back.

   The fight begins as Crona immediately uses their Madness Fusion just before they block Maka's first strike after she races up to the Moon's mouth. After Crona's strike misses Maka, they get kicked in the face repeatedly by her until they get knocked to the ground. Crona then tries to stab Maka with The Uncleanliness, but misses again, telling her that she's the idiot since she knows that it's dangerous to come close to them with just a scythe. After making Maka vault over them by attacking her with The Abyss of Despair, Crona asks her if she can dodge their third blade, The Darkness, this time. It quickly gets blocked by Black☆Star, who then kicks them a safe distance away from them. After they recover, Crona tells Maka that they would have got her if she was alone. Maka tells Crona that the reason she's not alone is because she's weak, and tells them that they're not alone either. But Crona just replies by saying that they no longer need anyone, and yells to Maka that they're not weak like her as they launch a powered-up Screech Alpha at them. Black☆Star stops the attack easily, but is a bit surprised when Crona manages to push him back a bit with just brute force. Maka then trips Crona and strikes them in the torso area, but they quickly recover from it and knock Maka to the edge of a cliff, and uses Bloody Lance to try and finish her before she can climb back until Black☆Star caught it with
   Shadow☆Star: First Form - Chain of Blackness
   and pulls it towards him in order to throw it right back at Crona, who manages to divert its part by blocking.

   Crona then sprouts two thorn-covered vines from their shoulders and uses then to pull on one of the moon's teeth, causing it to fall on top of Maka and Black☆Star, but that fails since Black☆Star catches it before it could crush them and toss the two both off the moon. After that, Crona uses an attack similar to Medusa's Vector Arrow to attack them, and though they only got a scratch each after blocking most of the attacks, Crona seems delighted as they use Rose Thorn Storm to get some distance between them. Soon, it’s revealed why Crona was happy when Maka and Black☆Star only got a scratch from their previous attack: Any living target that Crona's thorns scratch have their soul distorted, which is what happens when Maka and Black☆Star suddenly undergo soul rejection with Soul and Tsubaki. Soul then tries to use his keyboard to cancel the madness of the Black Blood out, but he and Tsubaki suddenly get snatched by Crona, who looked as if they are falling even further into the Kishin’s madness, and is confused as to why his keyboard can't make a sound. Though Black☆Star can still fight without Tsubaki, Crona shouts that they are relived as they launch another assault at the two while Spirit is steadily climbing up to where they are fighting.

   In part 3, Black☆Star begins to try to get Soul and Tsubaki back by first using Soul Force on Crona, who blocks it by using multiple thorns as a shield before counter-attacking by turning them into multiple thorn arrows. Crona then turns their attention to Maka, who dodges most of them before Black☆Star protected her from a few arrows she couldn't avoid. They then manage to flip Black☆Star over before hanging him in the air by his feet with two more vines before attempting to kill Maka with a pillar of thorn arrows before Spirit arrives just in time to save Maka by blocking the attack. When Spirit takes Soul's place as Maka's weapon, Crona unleashes another wave of thorn arrows, but Maka immediately stops the attack in its tracks before charging at them. Crona quickly uses Thorn Defense to stop Maka's assault while they constantly question them on how they are able to sync their soul wavelengths together. Soon, Crona's Thorn Defense is quickly destroyed when Maka uses Witch Hunter, then Demon Hunter afterwards in quick succession, allowing Soul and Tsubaki to escape from Crona's grasp and change back into their human forms. When Spirit tells Crona that the reason they are able to resonate together is because of their bonds as parent and child, Crona begins to cry as they go into a mental breakdown. Four scarf-like appendages suddenly sprout out of Crona's back and wrap them inside as it turns into a massive ball. When the ball cracks open, part of Asura's face is seen as the chapter ends.

   Soon after. Crona is surprised to see Maka and Soul floating towards them, but thinks it's just hallucination of Maka until she hits them with a Maka Chop, proving that she's real. After realizing that Maka is real, Crona comments on how Maka's obsession to actually come all the way to see them. Maka simply tells Crona it's not an obsession, but believing in them is the reason for coming to find them and that believing is the human's strength. When Maka tells Crona it's time for them to go back outside,Crona tells her that they can't return yet because they have committed many unforgivable sins and, while that they are happy that Maka came for them, there is something that only they can do with the courage they got from her. After obtaining the
   Book of Eibon
   from Maka, which was the same book she used earlier when she used Maka Chop on them, Crona takes Brew out of the book and explains their final plan to neatly seal Asura away with the Mad Blood. When Maka asks what would happen to them, Crona just replies that this their way of paying Maka back since she gave them their courage. After they give Maka a hug, they go on to tell Maka that she is the first person who dealt with them and that they don't really care about the world or the sin they need to atone for. They say that they are doing this simply for her and for them to suppress the kishin's madness, Maka has to make the kishin bleed. Once Soul summons a sheet of music with souls as notes to return to return to the outside with. Crona reluctantly adds their soul to the start of the song, thinking they doesn't deserve to be in it before Soul gives some gentle encouragement. Soul and Maka leave, but not before Maka yells back that she'll come back for Crona and tells them to wait for her. Smiling peacefully Crona simply tells her that they believe in her. Once Maka uses a Kishin-Hunt Slash to make Asura bleed, Crona activates Brew to power up the Mad Blood to its full potential and uses it to seal away Asura once again by surrounding the entire moon itself in a dome of Mad Blood, speaking the words "Let's meet again Maka", before the task is finished.
