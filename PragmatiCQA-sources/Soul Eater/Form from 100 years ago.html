   Carrying himself in an aristocratic manner like his mistress, Mosquito is a neat and formal individual who values proper etiquette, utilizes proper speech, and uses extensive vocabulary compared Giriko's crass and coarse nature.
   As a genuine, firm believer of Arachnopobia's beliefs as well as Arachne, Mosquito himself can be seen even crying out of happiness when things are flowing Arachnophobia's way, and can be motivational to his fellow members.
   Unlike his mistress, he possesses some honorable traits and was willing to let go of
   Team Maka
   when they held their own against him, despite the fact he purposely bid time for them in the Magnetic Field and was impressed with their display.

   Despite this, however, Mosquito is a dark character. As a fierce believer of Arachnophobia, he has also shown himself to not hesitate in killing any enemy of his organisation no matter reagardless of age. He is willing to manipulate extremely skilled men such as

   with those he cares about, like Angela.
   Despite his mostly elegant demeanor, even he has a temper and can extend his anger towards other individuals in front of his mistress, namely Giriko.
   When in battle, he has a tendency to cap his own power and is utterly confident in his power and transformations. While

   , this trait has caused him to suffer humiliating defeats, the manga showcases that this is most likely the byproduct of his incredible power, which even Team Maka has acknowledged.
   When presented in a life-threatening situation, even Mosquito at times can value his own life over lowly members of Arachnophobia.

   Mosquito has a quirk of saying "my boy" or "my girl" during conversation when speaking to those younger then him.
   With his own admission, Mosquito revealed that despite his differences with Giriko, he once held a similar mindset to the chainsaw when he was younger and cited he was a "hot-blooded one back in the day".
