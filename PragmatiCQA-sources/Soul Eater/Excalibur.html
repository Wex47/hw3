   superiority complex
   is practically applicable to everyone. Amongst such disparaging remarks, Excalibur propagates numerous nonsensical and confused rants about its supposed mythic exploits, before bursting into
   song

   Despite this, he has portrayed moments of complete seriousness when called upon. He was serious with King Arthur and with Shinigami. Furthermore, he has been willing to lend himself to people without his provisions, such as to Liz when they were trying to save Kid. This hints at a more complex personality. In fact, one could consider his annoying personality was crafted as a result of him being the "Elder God of Madness Born From Rage."

   Excalibur is a simplistic
   anthropomorphic
   creature, whose diminished stature barely even equates to that of a small child. Its misshapen facial features comprise of bulbous eyes. He also has a prominent upturned snout, a physical representation alluding to its reserved and pretentious attitude, while the remainder of its small white body displays slender limbs and feet strangely akin to those of a rabbit. The only slight indication of Excalibur's prestige is his high quality attire, consisting from a white
   top hat
   that nearly equals him in height and a similarly coloured shirt with a frilled
   ruff
   , worn under a white jacket. However, this esteemed air is severely compromised by the absence of any clothing covering the creature's lower half. Excalibur also is never seen without his signature cane, which strangely seems to be an extension of himself, since it transforms into and out of weapon form with him.

Evidently pleased by the current state of affairs, Hero momentarily forgets to remain three paces behind Excalibur but suffers the consequent reprimand rather happily, which instead causes Excalibur to have a nasty fit of sneezes. However, by the next day, things have returned to normality and Hero once again succumbs to the academy's bullies in the absence of Excalibur. Questioned as to whether he had finally grown annoyed of the 1000 Provisions prescribed by Excalibur's covenant, Hero explains that it was instead the creature's incessant sneezing that he couldn't stand, forcing him to return the sword to its previous residence.

Ignoring Excalibur's resultant claim that all literary works originate from him, a plan is formulated to proceed to the next chapter but to ensure that they are not interrupted again; the attention of the Holy Sword must be distracted.
