   Carrying himself in an aristocratic manner like his mistress, Mosquito is a neat and formal individual who values proper etiquette, utilizes proper speech, and uses extensive vocabulary compared Giriko's crass and coarse nature.
   As a genuine, firm believer of Arachnopobia's beliefs as well as Arachne, Mosquito himself can be seen even crying out of happiness when things are flowing Arachnophobia's way, and can be motivational to his fellow members.
   Unlike his mistress, he possesses some honorable traits and was willing to let go of
   Team Maka
   when they held their own against him, despite the fact he purposely bid time for them in the Magnetic Field and was impressed with their display.

   Despite this, however, Mosquito is a dark character. As a fierce believer of Arachnophobia, he has also shown himself to not hesitate in killing any enemy of his organisation no matter reagardless of age. He is willing to manipulate extremely skilled men such as
   Mifune
   with those he cares about, like Angela.
   Despite his mostly elegant demeanor, even he has a temper and can extend his anger towards other individuals in front of his mistress, namely Giriko.
   When in battle, he has a tendency to cap his own power and is utterly confident in his power and transformations. While

   , this trait has caused him to suffer humiliating defeats, the manga showcases that this is most likely the byproduct of his incredible power, which even Team Maka has acknowledged.
   When presented in a life-threatening situation, even Mosquito at times can value his own life over lowly members of Arachnophobia.

   Mosquito has a quirk of saying "my boy" or "my girl" during conversation when speaking to those younger then him.
   With his own admission, Mosquito revealed that despite his differences with Giriko, he once held a similar mindset to the chainsaw when he was younger and cited he was a "hot-blooded one back in the day".

   As Arachne's most trusted operative, Mosquito is charged with overseeing the development of the
   Moral Manipulation Machine
   , which is currently nearing its completion within a concealed location. At this distant construction facility; Mosquito receives a detailed description upon the present status of the machine, before proceeding to ask a rather sullen
   Mifune
   if he would not consider dropping
   that little witch
   to instead become his bodyguard.

   During this time;
   DWMA
   launch a planned infiltration upon the laboratory using the combined assistance of
   Sid Barrett
   ,
   Mira Naigus
   and
   Yumi Azusa
   . While Sid and Mira partake in direct action, Yumi
   observes
   from behind the scenes, noting the presence of an aging monster's soul (belonging to Mosquito) within the target room. As she relays this information, the facility's alarms are suddenly triggered, provoking Mosquito to attend to the matter personally by offering a gracious welcome to the enraged intruder,

   . When Mifune seems reluctant to confront the perceived child standing before him, Mosquito simply questions
   <i key="fb85fe21-92ac-4667-b3b3-bd836fb5571d">
    "what's the matter"

   and takes hold of Angela's hand with an elated sneer.
  </p>
  <p key="f4c445ba-d9a5-4412-91bd-c4ec6f7593d2">
   As the battle rages on between intruder and bodyguard, Mosquito warns Mifune that he won't forgive him if he goes it easy, which further elicits an even fiercer round of fighting. At the confrontations conclusion, Mosquito urges Mifune to finish his opponent, threatening that Arachnophobia will no longer provide protection for Angela. However, the issue is never resolved due to the disappearance of Mosquito's entire left arm and torso, as a single shot tears through his body. In desperation, he drains the blood of a fleeing scientist and takes his leave.

   After the destruction of the Moral Manipulation Machine and with Mosquito's apologetic return, Giriko insults him by calling his judgment on the situation of whether their soldiers are fit meaningless, as he himself isn't fit. A small confrontation ensues, where each trades offenses at the other, provoking Mosquito into launching numerous attacks. However; just as Giriko proposes that he take a commemorative photo after cutting Mosquito up into little bits, when Mosquito threatens to go back to his form from 800 years ago, a messenger bursts in. Thus, bringing the battle to a sudden conclusion.

   Mosquito, sent by Arachne, appeared on the "
   Lost Island
   " to locate and take
   Brew
   , before DWMA. While retreating,
   Maka
   and the others meet Mosquito, who claims to have "Brew" in his possession. The group initially assume they have the advantage because of their extended time limit but after Mosquito reverts his body to a stronger
   form from 100 years ago
   , the team is easily overpowered by him. This is until
   Soul
   convinces his companions to leave the task of linking their
   Soul Resonance
   to him. After this power-up, the group manages to deal a crushing defeat to Mosquito and leave him wounded. However; during their period battling, their time on the island had significantly decreased, to such an extent that retreat was the only option. Mosquito comments that he can increase his time by reverting again back to a younger age.
  </p>
  <p key="6063cb0f-4227-4cfe-a244-2f366cb513f0">
   Knowing they can no longer stay on the island, Mosquito honorably allows them to escape. In the end, DWMA's mission fails. However; it turns out that the "Brew" Mosquito had acquired, had seemingly succumbed to the devastating energies subjected to it due to its location and had ceased to function.

   At some point later, after the discovery of the infiltration, Mosquito meets with both Kid and
   Free
   in tower 8. The two of them agree to work together (though both are reluctant to do so) in order to defeat Mosquito, while taking the chance to simultaneously destroy the
   Lock
   . Mosquito then transforms into his form from 100 years ago, the time when he was it his physical peak, and proceeds to engage in battle.

  <p key="4169cde6-0cb2-47e4-9efa-b7e7a681dc18">
   For the first half of the battle, Kid and Free have the upper hand, with Free dealing a tremendous blow to Mosquito with his Ice Magic. Annoyed, Mosquito transforms once again into his
   form from 200 years ago
   , the time when he was at his fastest. Due to the speed of this new form, he quickly gains the advantage over the pair. However, Free counterattacks by slamming him through into a solid wall. The three of them crash to the ground below, there Mosquito tries to attack Kid but Kid dodges both of his attacks and counterattacks. Free then uses his
   Ice Pillar
   attack to limit Mosquito's movements. Mosquito, realizing the futility of battling them, tries to draw back but is trapped by Free's
   Ice Bind
   and is subsequently shot by Kid. Free then traps him once again in
   A Vasili
   . With Mosquito trapped, Free transforms in to his werewolf form and charges
   Demon Eye Cannon
   and Kid prepares his
   Death Cannon
   . Both fire their attacks simultaneously, seemingly defeating Mosquito.

  <p key="629e40ff-d5ee-4f33-9ebc-9234a3493b21">
   Mosquito, still alive, is greatly surprised that Free and Kid both managed to damage him to this degree. So, he transforms once again, into his
   form from 400 years ago
   , healing all his previous injuries. Mosquito, now confident, questions whether or not these two would last more than 4 seconds. Then, within an instant, he cuts both Free in half from the waist and severs Kid's arm in mere moments, before reflecting that they couldn't even last 1 second.

   Unfinished with his job, Mosquito grabs Kid by the head and lifts him from the floor. He notes that the "
   Lines of Sanzu
   " on Kid are incomplete and uses
   Nightmare Noise
   to inflict further damage on the injured Kid.
   Liz
   begs Free to help Kid, saying he will die, however, Free is too injured to do so. Mosquito then insults
   Shinigami
   by stating that His supervision is not enough to keep Arachnophobia in check and that the world filled by the madness of the

   is a different place, where Arachnophobia will ultimately take DWMA's place as masters of the world. Kid then proclaims that he will not let that happen. It is then that the real Brew actives and merges with Kid, completing one of the three Sanzu Lines. During Kid's powers awakening, Kid's arm is reattached through what appears to be
   shadow skulls
   . On the other side of the room, Free begins to stand on his hands and appears to be moving, confusing Mosquito. However, Kid realizes what is going on and prepares to battle Mosquito on his own.

   Kid attacks Mosquito, who was currently off guard. Mosquito manages to counterattack with Nightmare Noise, however, Kid uses
   Skull Shield
   to protect himself. Kid follows up by performing a Soul Resonance, however, Mosquito splits him self up and uses
   Darkness Discord
   , doing a significant amount of damage. Kid begins to utilize his new powers and attempts to shoot down each of Mosquito's 8,000 bats, using the new technique

   . After a brutal display of endurance and power, both opponents appear heavily injured. Mosquito then notices the real Brew falling out from Kid but before he can do anything, he hears a nearby explosion. This is quickly revealed to be the Lock, which was destroyed by Free, who used
   Forwarding Vision
   to fool Mosquito into thinking he had remained in one place. Mosquito, now worried of Arachne's safety, retreats. After his retreat, Kid comments on which way he is headed, referring to Mosquito as a "vampire".

   Mosquito makes his assumed final appearance when he returns to the control room, where he scowls at '
   Eibon
   ' for leaving Arachne defenseless, to which he informs Mosquito that he too was just following orders. When Kid arrives at the location, 'Eibon' and Mosquito are about to engage in battle. Mosquito reveals his deep hatred for 'Eibon' and resents leaving Arachne in his care. Mosquito then transforms into his
   form from 800 years ago
   , however, before he can attack, he is slammed into a wall by a monster from the confines of
   The Book of Eibon
   . Before Eibon finishes him off, he asks Mosquito if would like to hear his true name. Mosquito replies that he has no interest in knowing the name of a despicable and avaricious man. Eibon ignores Mosquito's reply and reveals his actual name, Noah. Mosquito is then blasted by the creature but before his demise, he utters his final words, shouting
