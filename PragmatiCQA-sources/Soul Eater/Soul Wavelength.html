   It is the part of the soul which is invisible to both the naked eye and that of
   Soul Perception
   visually, though it can be sensed. In representation in the series, it is often likes that of a cogs in a machine due to the importance of all meisters and weapons who are paired having compatible soul wavelengths
   . Certain users can also use their wavelengths offensively, such as that of the utilisers of
   Soul Menace
   .

   Being the rhythm of the soul itself, the Soul Wavelength carries some of the characteristics of a character that helps a user of
   Soul Perception
   determines the type of characteristics of a individual. As such, a meister can determine a character's personality and race/species.
   In addition, the wavelength of an individual is similar to that of their parents and as such, may inherit some of their personality and traits.

   The Soul Wavelength is also important, being the very mechanic that enables a weapon to pair up with a meister. A meister and weapon are comparably worked like a electric guitar and an AMP: the sound (Soul Wavelength) that comes from an electric guitar (Meister) is rather faint. However, when connected to an AMP (Weapon), the Soul Wavelength is amplified, giving it lots of power. In short, the combination of two Soul Wavelength combine and amplifies the meister's wavelength and, in turn, gives them power and gives them the ability to achieve a
   Soul Resonance
   .

   made be vary such as a weapon from being too heavy to be picked up or the scolding of the hands. However, a meister attempting to utilize a Demon Weapon without a matching wavelength puts themselves in an enormous amount of strain both physically and mentally.
   Demon Weapons whose wavelengths are incompatible risk having their meister attack them with their soul wavelength, which can cause internal damage to even them in weapon form and cause them to bleed.
   Various factors can influence a rejection, such as two personalities clashing with hostility. Those with similar personalities, ironically, cannot create the most powerful of
   Soul Resonance
   and are less compatible.
