   's creation of the protagonist, Maka Albarn, involved him purposely making her a female character in response to
   having primarily male main characters. He also paired her with Soul (along with other main characters having a male/female pairing) to demonstrate an equal representation of gender. Maka's fighting style with a scythe was given for it's uniqueness and resisted drawing influences from other people regarding his main protagonists, inlcuding Maka.

   One of the her main insecurities seen early on was her fear of her partner, Soul, being the one who "carried" her throughout her battles. So much so she strove at one point to get stronger to the point of ignoring her partner's personal views on the situation and blamed herself for Soul falling to Crona and

   She also struggled with accepting her partner's celebrity status as a Death Scythe, feeling that he became one because of his own efforts with her contribution being useless. She became jealous of not only Liz sharing the same interest in music and understanding it better with Soul, but also Patty's ability to be an even better fighter than her.
   This caused her to break down so much, she was almost willing to let

   Maka is a flat-chested, teenage young woman with light taupe hair which she keeps in pigtails, although there are certain times she may stylize them into buns or wear them straight down. Maka's primary outfit is a typical schoolgirl outfit consisting of a white blouse with a yellow sweater vest, a green striped tie, a red plaid skirt, and black boots with white buckles. When using Soul, she usually wears white gloves. Maka also wears a trench coat with a cloak-like end (which alters its shape in various parts of both the manga and anime). In her initial appearance in the first chapter, her trench coat was so long that, when buttoned up, it seemed that she was not wearing a skirt.

  <p key="b3e5054f-7913-4065-becc-7999bf06ec62">
   When Maka joins Spartoi, her outfit changes, though it still shows similarities to her previous attire. Maka's Spartoi uniform is very similar to that of a Japanese schoolgirl's sailor uniform with the colouring of the classic Spartoi uniform: a white blouse attached with a blue sailor-style collar with a red necktie that has a pink coiled tip and a short, blue, pleated skirt. Alongside this uniform, Maka wears black tights and the classic white Spartoi shoes, but stops wearing tights a few chapters later. Like her previous outfit, Maka wears a long trench coat, though it is white instead of black and has the Spartoi logo on the left shoulder as well as the fact that the cloak end splits in two. Her pigtails are fashioned using skull hairbands similar to

   Maka's soul, when viewed by Stein, has an orange-like colour and has her signature pigtails.
   Some comments from Ragnarok and Maka herself suggest that Maka's soul is quite small, especially when compared to those of others, such as Black☆Star's (although, like others, her soul grows in size considerably after she grows more powerful). When resonating with Soul, these "ponytails" turn into wings, revealing her soul to be a
   Grigori Soul

   The two attack again and successfully Resonate and connect their Witch Hunt. Unfortunately Stein is still able to overpower the attack, leaving Maka barely conscious on the ground. Before Stein can grab her however, Soul appears and crouches over Maka, telling him that he will not let him hurt his Meister. Stein, pleased by Soul's bravery, gives him a pass point, and Stein reveals that the lesson has now ended. Everyone finds out that Black☆Star is actually alive and that this was all a part of the remedial lesson, much to Maka's despair. From this point onwards Stein becomes Maka's teacher. Maka, horrified, actually starts to want her father to be her teacher instead.

She watches in dismay as the helpless pair fail to act as a Meister and Weapon and end up being defeated by Death the Kid after trying to execute a sneak attack. However, Black☆Star and Soul win by default as Kid then loses consciousness after coughing up blood. Maka explains that Soul's sneak attack earlier had cut Kid's bangs, making them asymmetrical, and he had fainted because he had just noticed this.

The two agree that Black☆Star can only be partners with Tsubaki. Maka and Soul agree to work together again as they reconcile. When Death comes to pick up his son, Kid, Maka takes the opportunity to see his soul. She, however cannot see it and leaves it at that. What she does not know, however, is that the reason she cannot see Death's soul is because it covers the entirety of the DWMA.

   Maka pays a visit to Medusa in order to get a blood test, concerned of her condition after coughing up Black Blood in her battle with Free. However, both to Maka and Medusa's surprise (Medusa had seen Maka cough up Black Blood, surveying the battle with Eruka) there is no trace of Black Blood in her body. Medusa gives Maka some medicinal herbs in hopes of strengthening the Black Blood, and then asks Maka on how Soul is doing. She tells her how Soul had told her of his dreams, and that he had been quite distressed. Maka is shocked as she had not heard this from Soul and tries to hide her anger towards her partner as she excuses herself. She crossly decides to confront him when she gets home. However, on the way, she meets Stein, who, suspicious of Medusa, takes the medicine she had received from her.

Soul declines this offer, and when Spirit arrives, asking his daughter to dance with him, Soul persuades her to do so, much to her dismay.

During this battle, the Black Blood causes Maka to fall into a crazed state of delirium, while Soul Eater holds on to both of their sanities, drowning in the darkness he refers to as madness. Because of the Black Blood hardening within her body, she is able to gain an immunity against slash and crush attacks and also acquires superior strength, quickly overpowering Crona.

   While in this state, Maka is not only quite crazy but also quite silly, as her movements, behavior, and her fighting style change drastically, and she resembles a state of inebriation. Her drastic behavior is clearly indicated by her swaying, constant giggling, and attempt to devour Crona's head. The true Maka is embarrassed by her actions, but Soul reassures her that her current state is no different as to how she usually acts. Soul tells her to quickly find Crona's soul. After passing by her own soul and her partner's soul, she sees Crona's soul. Whilst her physical self is crazily attacking them, her mental self manages to see into Crona's soul.

   On the way, Soul is concerned for Maka's wounds she had received, but Maka realizes that the Black Blood had healed them. However, she sees that her Black Blood is no longer in her body, and wonders why. However, she has no time to think as she senses Asura being released. She rushes to stop Asura. Despite her effort Asura is still released, but Maka still tries to stop him, grabbing one of his skin scarves and using Soul to try and slow him down. However, when Asura emerges above Death City, some falling debris hits her and she is left falling towards Death City. Luckily, Soul cushions the blow, probably saving her life. Maka still briefly tries to go after Asura, but loses consciousness. After Asura escapes, Soul carries her through the ruined Death City.

She ends up persuaded to play basketball with Soul, Black☆Star, Tsubaki, Patti and Death the Kid, with the excuse that they are missing one player (Liz). To make the game more interesting, Soul brings up the idea of a bet for each of the teams' respective captain to follow if they lose. If Kid's team loses, they will put the paintings on Kid's walls in his mansion off by 1 in; if Maka's team loses, she has to go shopping with her father. Ultimately, Kid's team wins, since Maka, having never played basketball, easily loses as she does not know the rules. Maka reluctantly asks her father to go shopping with her, and Spirit ends up vomiting out of happiness and suprise, much to her shock.

He questions Maka, saying if she deserves to be top of the class, a comment which hits Maka hard.

Luckily, Soul comes up with the idea of Chain Resonance and augmenting it with his music. The group laugh as they hear he is going to play the piano in his soul. When Soul asks why they are laughing, Maka replies that they had finally got Soul to play the piano for them.

Since Mosquito can revert to an even younger form of himself, he can remain in the vortex for longer, and the group have no choice but to retreat without Brew.

She, Kirikou and Soul notice Black☆Star's signature on the back of the mission card Kirikou had chosen. Maka expresses sadness at how things are quieter at the DWMA now that Black☆Star and Tsubaki have taken a leave of absence.

Before she can deduce anymore, the Clown attacks and a large battle ensues. Eventually the Clown's soul begins to effect Maka and she is sucked into its madness, with any efforts to save her blocked as pipes surround the pair. Maka is forced to see visions of the deaths of her friends and family, in an attempt to drag her deeper into madness. However, Soul manages to reach her with his Wavelength. Maka meets with Soul in her mind, both dressed as if they are in the Black Room, with the exception that Maka's face is partly covered by the Clown's mask after being influenced by the madness. Having her sit at a piano, Soul tells her that the songs he plays are of madness. Maka protests that although she does not know much about music, she likes Soul's songs. Soul explains to her how madness gives people strength, but beneath the insanity, when the soul endures the darkness, is a strength that is even more intriguing. Maka calls this strength courage, and Soul tells her that they should have Crona know of courage too. Soul takes Maka's hand and tells her to let him listen to her soul. Maka touches a key at random, which is a G. Due to the influence of Soul's Wavelength, Maka's courage allows her to break free of the illusions. The two resume their fight against the Clown.

Maka suggests that because Soul is a Death Scythe now, that he should be able to fly with ease. Marie objects, telling them that becoming a Death Scythe is not something so simple. She continues, saying that the advanced wavelength control that a Death Scythe obtains from a Witch Soul can grant magical abilities. If she can use the

   In beginning the training, Soul transforms into his Weapon form. He has a slightly different form now, more so where his 'eye' is located in his Weapon form. They are then told their souls must be synchronized in order to complete the task. They must both focus on the same image, of Kim flying. While doing this, the scythe blade on Soul shrinks. Marie explains that form manipulation is basic for a Death Scythe and that they must have decided that the long blade is not necessary for flight. After, both Maka and Soul create sharp, blade-like wings at the end of Soul's Weapon form. However Soul, upon being told by Spirit to imagine Maka as an angel, instead thinks of the somewhat negative things she has done. Maka then starts spinning upside down in circles until they both fall, due to Soul losing concentration. They still argue about whose fault it is. Maka then rants about how she had wanted angel wings instead of the spiky ones that appeared. They argue again which leads to Maka saying she had wished she was partnered with Ox. Soul does not understand this as Ox is a Meister. Later, at the DWMA, Maka is still fantasizing on how she is now considered an angel Soul still telling her to drop the idea. They are then later called by Spirit to discuss something.

   Soul is seen once again with Maka practicing flying with Kim. Despite the extremely slow speed given by the tiny wings, Maka is thrilled to have the fluffy angel wings she desires. Prior to this, Spirit speaks to them about the many enemies they have such as the witches (more specifically Medusa), the new group Noah has formed, and the Kishin. Spirit warns them that they aim to take out talented people on their side as well, meaning Maka is also a target. Maka's advanced Soul Perception is the reason for her being targeted, and that it is their trump card against the Kishin. Spirit explains that the DWMA must protect Maka at all costs. After making a remark about her father, saying that he wants to protect her because of her abilities, Maka leaves the room. Spirit then asks Soul to watch over Maka. Going back to the training, Soul tells Maka that he believes her father cares more about her safety than her ability. They then continue on talking about the many responsibilities they have still to do, such as saving

Soul remarks that Gopher is not ordinary, and Maka then explains that Gopher also has the same angel type Grigori Soul as she does, but filled with evil magic. Gopher then launches another barrage of

Soul begins to talk about their difference in speed and it may be helpful if they bring the fight to the ground. Maka realizes the full meaning of Soul's words that they are not ready yet as they are losing the battle. Now irritated by the small angel wings, she demands Soul to create new ones. Soul grins and complies, and the two perform a

Immediately, Gopher is forced on the defensive after Maka delivers numerous hits, which includes a Witch Hunter. Angered that the body

Driven by Gopher's hatred, the ball of energy follows Maka everywhere. This prompts Maka to perform Majin Hunt and proceeds to slice through the ball of energy. Maka continues her attack and manages to inflict a shallow wound on Gopher. When Soul asks why she held back in the end, Maka replies that he is not on Shinigami's wanted list. Maka then witnesses Gopher retreat via a page from the Book of Eibon.

She expresses her amazement at the sheer amount, and states that although Soul usually got love letters like these, they had increased dramatically in recent times. Soul grumpily replies that it's only because he has become a Death Scythe. Maka pauses, before thumping her partner's back (hard) and suggesting they go home. As they leave, a

Black☆Star breaks the door down, even though there is a sign saying that no one must enter. Soul proposes they should just go in too, but Maka replies that sneaking around is much cooler, comparing herself to a heroine in a mystery novel. Soul soon gets bored and calls it all a waste of time. Maka spots the mysterious girl still spying on them, and wonders what she's up to, having noticed her already with her Soul Perception.
It is here revealed that Maka was actually the one who secretly took out the Level 4 book from the Library, which was the Book of Eibon manuscript that Death the Kid thought was originally stolen by Medusa. She apologizes to Shinigami for this, and tells him not to blame Spirit (who’s ID card she used to borrow the book). She begs Shinigami to let her go on the mission to help save Kid. Shinigami, with some persuasion, complies. Maka, determined to rescue her friend, tells the rest of Spartoi that, 'This is for Kid!'

The group soon enter the first Chapter, Lust, and Maka has her gender changed, based on everything she sees desirable in the opposite sex.

   After passing through the Lust Chapter and into the second Chapter, Gluttony, Maka realizes that although they had left the Lust Chapter, she still appears male, although her personality has returned to normal. The Table of Contents explains that they will only gradually return to their original gender depending on the intensity of their sexual desire. The more intense it is, the slower one changes back. Maka snidely passes off the comment that Soul would probably change the slowest. She almost succumbs to the large amount of food on display in the Chapter, and barely manages to control herself.

   Maka ends up getting separated from the rest in the third Chapter, Envy. She finds herself caught up in an illusion based upon her envy. She ends up in a fake the DWMA, and is approached by the mysterious girl she had seen spying on her and Soul. The girl tells her that she is not worthy of being Soul's partner, and how little she understands Soul. Maka protests this, saying that she reads lots of music books in order to understand Soul more. However, when commanded to spin a nearby broom like she does with a scythe, Maka surprisingly fails to do so, which results in the girl mocking her, saying that she is only a bookworm that always needs to have Soul helping her. Maka remembers how Soul had always needed to help and lead her, and the girl reveals that she is envious of people who understand music like Soul, in contrast to Maka who, in a flashback, shows that she does not reciprocate Soul's appreciation for music.

Before he injures Maka, he is intercepted by Soul, and he transforms into his Weapon form as Maka prepares to fight. However, still emotionally distressed from the Envy chapter, she is unable to concentrate, and ends up leaving herself open for Giriko's attacks.

However, he states that this is not the sort of courage that Maka had shown to him. Determined to show his own courage this time, he stands up again to fight.

   She then proceeds to apologize to Soul, who forgives her and begins to attack Giriko again with new resolve, but is still distraught over the Envy Chapter and is starting to lose when Soul comes up with a plan to intercept Giriko's Soul Wavelength by using his piano and Arachne's ability to spread Wavelengths via webs. Maka then uses her Soul Perception on Giriko and Soul plays his piano and uses it to stop Giriko. Maka then proceeds to cut him in half and he then explodes. Believing Giriko is defeated she begins to walk away now feeling less distraught over the Envy Chapter. Then a now female Giriko comes up from behind and cuts Maka's back. He then explains that he had had another body for himself for backup in case something like this happened, and being in the Chapter of Sloth, Maka had not realized this as she had been too sloppy with her Soul Perception. He says that he is disappointed that he is a 'big-titted female' and says that people do not explode when they die. Maka then says that Arachne had exploded when she died. Giriko responds by praising Arachne, saying that she had been, 'something else,' and wonders if Maka would explode when she dies. Maka and Grikio continue to fight, but Maka starts to lose as she proceeds to acquire more injuries and Soul's piano is destroyed by Giriko's Wavelength. She begins to lose hope, convinced that she will die. However, before Giriko can kill Maka, his soul, not being able to take eight hundred years of rage, begins to rupture. Maka sees this using Soul Perception and then proceeds to slightly mock Giriko, telling him to sit down and rest, as there are many chairs and beds in the Sloth Chapter. Giriko, enraged, tries to kill her, but his soul explodes before he can do so, leaving Giriko's body as an empty shell. Maka laughs at his demise and is later seen carried by Soul on his back after the battle.

   During the battle on the moon, Maka and Black☆Star fight to defeat Asura. They are both defeated, and Maka then discovers her soul being out of wavelength with Soul when she tries to wield him to continue fighting. Black☆Star holds him off for the time being because Maka is unable to fight, until her father Spirit shows up and tells her to wield him and fight against Asura using him. She is able to wield her father temporarily and do serious damage to Asura, which puts her and Soul's wavelength back in resonance and allows her to wield Soul again afterwards.

   Soon, Kid finally shows up and joins Maka and Black☆Star in the fight. Soul determines the only way to defeat Asura is to utilize the Black Blood using Maka's Soul Perception, and Maka dons the black dress again to wield the Black Blood's power. While Kid and Black☆Star hold Asura back, Maka uses the Black Blood's power to enter Asura and talk to Crona, who had been consumed by Asura. She convinces Crona that they are doing the wrong thing, and Crona feels amazed that someone would go through such lengths and risks to help them after all they had done wrong. Crona, admiring Maka's selflessness and feeling they did finally have someone who cared about them, decides to use their power to seal up the Kishin on the moon. This in turn, however, puts Crona stuck inside the Moon's Black Blood alongside the Kishin.

Maka returns to Death City with Black☆Star and Kid after the defeat of Asura. She then learns of Death's death, and sits at home by herself for a while thinking, feeling depressed about Death's passing, and about Crona's sealing inside the moon.
