   Carrying himself in an aristocratic manner like his mistress, Mosquito is a neat and formal individual who values proper etiquette, utilizes proper speech, and uses extensive vocabulary compared Giriko's crass and coarse nature.
   As a genuine, firm believer of Arachnopobia's beliefs as well as Arachne, Mosquito himself can be seen even crying out of happiness when things are flowing Arachnophobia's way, and can be motivational to his fellow members.
   Unlike his mistress, he possesses some honorable traits and was willing to let go of
   Team Maka
   when they held their own against him, despite the fact he purposely bid time for them in the Magnetic Field and was impressed with their display.

   Despite this, however, Mosquito is a dark character. As a fierce believer of Arachnophobia, he has also shown himself to not hesitate in killing any enemy of his organisation no matter reagardless of age. He is willing to manipulate extremely skilled men such as
   Mifune
   with those he cares about, like Angela.
   Despite his mostly elegant demeanor, even he has a temper and can extend his anger towards other individuals in front of his mistress, namely Giriko.
   When in battle, he has a tendency to cap his own power and is utterly confident in his power and transformations. While

   , this trait has caused him to suffer humiliating defeats, the manga showcases that this is most likely the byproduct of his incredible power, which even Team Maka has acknowledged.
   When presented in a life-threatening situation, even Mosquito at times can value his own life over lowly members of Arachnophobia.

   Mosquito has a quirk of saying "my boy" or "my girl" during conversation when speaking to those younger then him.
   With his own admission, Mosquito revealed that despite his differences with Giriko, he once held a similar mindset to the chainsaw when he was younger and cited he was a "hot-blooded one back in the day".

Despite some complications regarding Giriko and his antics angering Mosquito, Arachne orders Mosquito to take her to the castle on account of her fatigue after being resurrected. Arriving, Mosquito gets teary eyed as he announces the newly instated "network" that him and Arachne have spent 800 years expanding.

   As the battle rages on between intruder and bodyguard, Mosquito warns Mifune that he won't forgive him if he goes it easy, which further elicits an even fiercer round of fighting. At the confrontations conclusion, Mosquito urges Mifune to finish his opponent, threatening that Arachnophobia will no longer provide protection for Angela. However, the issue is never resolved due to the disappearance of Mosquito's entire left arm and torso, as a single shot tears through his body. In desperation, he drains the blood of a fleeing scientist and takes his leave.

A small confrontation ensues, where each trades offenses at the other, provoking Mosquito into launching numerous attacks. However; just as Giriko proposes that he take a commemorative photo after cutting Mosquito up into little bits, when Mosquito threatens to go back to his form from 800 years ago, a messenger bursts in.

   Mosquito, sent by Arachne, appeared on the "

   Brew

   Maka
   and the others meet Mosquito, who claims to have "Brew" in his possession. The group initially assume they have the advantage because of their extended time limit but after Mosquito reverts his body to a stronger
   form from 100 years ago
   , the team is easily overpowered by him. This is until
   Soul
   convinces his companions to leave the task of linking their
   Soul Resonance
   to him. After this power-up, the group manages to deal a crushing defeat to Mosquito and leave him wounded. However; during their period battling, their time on the island had significantly decreased, to such an extent that retreat was the only option. Mosquito comments that he can increase his time by reverting again back to a younger age.

   Knowing they can no longer stay on the island, Mosquito honorably allows them to escape. In the end, DWMA's mission fails. However; it turns out that the "Brew" Mosquito had acquired, had seemingly succumbed to the devastating energies subjected to it due to its location and had ceased to function.
