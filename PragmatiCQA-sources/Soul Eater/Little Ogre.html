   The Little Ogre acts not only as the manifestation of the Black Blood present within Soul, but also the subsequent madness it produces. As such he has an extremely cautious nature, concerned only with the concept of power and the goal of drawing Soul further into his intoxicating madness, which would mean that The Little Demon would be able to take Soul's body as his own. It seems he cannot lie, being a part of Soul; he is unable to keep secrets from him. However, he can distort the truth to Soul by only speaking partial truth and manipulating the manner in which he says things to him.

He has a noticably long, large nose, and completely white almond-shaped eyes. There appears to be a black mask around his eyes. He also has a wide, eerie smile and sharp teeth.

   along with Maka via Soul's piano playing. This provided the group with a massive power boost, easily overwhelming Mosquito's form from 100 years ago. It still retained the same consequences though, inflicting Soul with madness. However, Soul cut off the power when he knew they couldn't win due to the current circumstances.

Arachne's spider webs, which are invading the minds of everyone in the castle and causing madness, have also gotten into the soul room. However, Soul manages to turn this to his advantage by using
   Soul Resonance
   via piano playing to counter Arachne's power, defeating her without calling upon Little Ogre's power, much to the diminutive apparition's surprise.

   Kim Diehl
   , and
   Jacqueline O'Lantern Dupré
   to assist the DWMA Moscow forces to determine how Crona transformed Tsar and Feodor into globs of Black Blood. Upon their arrival in Moscow, Soul is clutching his chest with one hand—and clutching Maka’s pigtail with the other, as he has fallen again into madness. Soul screams out of his pain, as a blast of energy erupts from his chest’s scar, as if an eye is opening. From within Soul, the Little Ogre cackles at the prospect of ruining the
   Death Scythe
   's life.
  </p>
  <p key="6be615b5-b592-41f0-babf-6b11579716df">
   As the mad Soul fights Stein and his friends, Maka realizes that Soul's scar has reopened to the point that madness itself leaks out. Inside his soul, Soul demands that the Little Ogre explain what has happened to him—only to see the creature is no longer little but towering over him. The Ogre explains that Soul has finally become honest with himself, and he wants to hear the Weapon answer: "What kind of guy are you?"
  </p>
  <p key="e3ce15f6-5d9f-4fc6-a620-ce6463800fc4">
   As he faces down Soul, the large Ogre identifies the Weapon's problem: he is afraid to be more reckless and exploit the Black Blood to its potential because, even if it would make him stronger, then he would be judged for his madness. Soul hides behind excuses of his fear of madness and his desire for discipline.
  </p>
  <p key="8a157382-d7f1-47c4-99b7-bfa772b119d8">
   This is Soul's pattern, the Ogre decides, as the weapon has always held back out of a family history in fear of never being as good as other members of
   <a class="mw-redirect" href="Evans.html" key="99b5b185-249f-47ce-afbc-7c7cc02c5c42" title="Evans">
    his musical family
   </a>
   , including
   his brother Wes
   . But the Ogre challenges Soul: has anyone ever actually aloud made any comparison of the Evans brothers? So long as Soul says he is not really trying, then he does not have to be judged for coming up short. If Soul had tried to compete and actually try his hardest, then he would no longer look cool. The Ogre reasons this fear is why Soul changed his last name, so not to ruin his family's reputation.
  </p>
  <p key="5b4c509e-61da-47d6-ad06-fcfaaaff45fa">
   The Ogre issues a challenge: how much longer will he spin his wheels? Why not, as he has today, firm up, "grow a pair," and unleash that power? "Start playing for keeps!" the Ogre screams. "Who are you?"
  </p>
  <p key="45cc4506-384c-461a-85e1-c3e2ac13ec84">
   Even as the Ogre has its mouth up against Soul, screaming at him, Soul clicks his tongue. To answer who he is, Soul responds, "I already know." But as the Ogre is up close to him, he sees how things really are: the Ogre never grew—he somehow is piloting a larger robotic duplicate of himself!
  </p>
  <p key="8a4096d2-b1ae-4084-86b9-332a44e1e328">
   The Ogre leaps out of the robot, refusing to take credit for this robot: it was Soul's madness that manifested this form before the weapon. Soul counters that Ogre makes poor assumptions: the weapon changed his last name not out of fear of embarrassing his family or to run away from them. "It was to draw a line."
  </p>
  <p key="7b5af7e0-5e88-4f6c-b210-42d941c2cb33">
   So the Ogre asks again: "Who are you?"
  </p>
  <p key="00ab3ad2-fe9a-44d5-9570-fed4e3f123e3">
   More confidently, Soul answers: "I'm the Demon Scythe Soul Eater."
  </p>
  <p key="37ca79d1-efbc-41da-aecc-1c0952ba5c3d">
   The madness has ended. The Ogre is disgusted at how anticlimactic Soul's answer is, lacking "flair" or "gusto." Soul responds that "not being able to" speak with such qualities is just "part of who I am." As Soul answers, he fails to notice his meister standing in front of him until she smashes his head in with her hand in retaliation for Soul trying to act cool after tugging on her pigtails.

   As Maka and Soul escape Asura's body, they not only repel Asura's internal Black Blood but also seem to tear the Little Ogre away from Soul's body. In the Black Room, the floor around the Little Ogre breaks apart, as if the Black Blood that is represented by this room is leaving Soul's body. All Ogre can say is: "It's gonna be lonely", implying he is being expelled from Soul's body. Upon exiting Asura, the blackness in Maka's dress is pulled away, leaving her in a white dress while that Black Blood is combined with the rest to form the seal around the Moon. After this point, the Ogre is not seen again for the remainder of the manga, potentially no longer part of Soul.

However, the manga version is simply the normal sized ogre sitting inside of a large mechanical imitation, this, and his comment about courage being unable to suppress madness, are clear references to the anime ending.
