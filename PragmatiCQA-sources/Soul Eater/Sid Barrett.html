   Prior to his death, Sid was known to be a friendly and well-respected teacher, having earned admiration and respect from not only the students he taught, whether they were in the EAT or NOT class, but even the likes of the staff such as

   He also was an individual never hesitated in helping a student and inspire them to unleash their latent potential.
   He also described himself as a stubborn individual, and that is the "

   , he still retained all his previous traits. While he initially portrayed himself to want to kill his students for them to be relieved of the fear of death, this ended up being a ruse in which the remedial lesson was to strengthen them, a part he played in willingly to help his students grow stronger.
   In addition, Sid carries himself as a professional and follows orders to the letter, a case he would use to spare
   Mifune
   since his mission wasn't to end the samurai's life and admitted to

  <p key="7d6860e3-5d45-4b09-9bef-214050695ead">
   When Sid was alive, he was a muscular, dark-skinned young man with cornrowed hair and black Japanese tattoos on both his arms which still remain in his zombie transformation. The kanji shown in the tattoo on his shoulder stands for "death", and the arrow under it stands for "person". He also possessed with a headband that had the writing meaning "hole" upon it but, after his transformation into a zombie, an actual hole through his head is now present where the writing once appeared.
  </p>
  <p key="9642c9ad-fd51-490a-b4e8-6a58df65a33d">
   After becoming a zombie, his skin has adopted a bluish tone and his face is composed of a flat, piggish nose, with pupilless white eyes and a mouth that persistently displays his top and bottom teeth. Despite being undead, he still retains the full extent of both his hair and physical build.
  </p>
  <p key="d542498c-ce3f-4396-b12d-8a3e9a481d68">
   Although Sid's clothing remains largely the same no matter what his own current condition is, it changes drastically to suit what the day-to-day circumstances entail. During normal everyday proceedings, he is commonly seen wearing blue jeans with a small chain hanging from one side and sneakers, accompanied by one of his various tops. Earlier in the series, this top is a
   simple white basketball jersey, embellished with a red number "23"
   on either side or his forename higher up on its back. Later, this changes to a red t-shirt with the image of a white, silhouetted tombstone upon either side while the word "tomb" is shown within the design on the front. Aside from his top, he is normally seen with a beanie hat, likely to cover the hole through his forehead. However, when conducting an operation for
   DWMA
   , Sid dons more appropriate garments befitting his present role. These typically comprise of an entirely black, sleeveless flak jacket, military combat pants and combat boots. These are accompanied by a forehead protector, iron bands encircling his wrists and further metal protectors on his ankles.

   After more weeks of intelligence gathering, Sid noticed details about the thefts of paperwork and research at the Death Weapon Meister Academy, indicating a potential suspect: Meme Tatane, whose sleepwalking habits were similar to the trance that Shaula's Traitors seemed to have. Sid coordinated a late-night sting at the Academy, drawing the sleepwalking Meme to the location while he posted his DWMA agents at the Academy's exit and snipers across the street on rooftops. Although the sleepwalking, hence possessed, Meme arrived, she was followed by Tsugumi and Anya. As Meme's actions were revealed, Shaula controlled Meme to have her attack her friends and escape the Academy, while Shaula herself possessed Sid's very snipers to attack the entrance guards.

   As Meme escaped the Academy, Sid followed her to the Square of Liberty in Death City. He was followed by his agents—but Sid then realized that Shaula had possessed them as well. Confronting the witch herself, Sid could not defeat her before she stabbed him with her venom. Rather than control Sid, however, Shaula said his strong will made him a poor candidate as one of her minions. Therefore, she commanded Meme to remove the replica of the Statue of Liberty based in the Square and stab its torch through Sid's head. The explosive sound of this attack alerted Akane and Clay who arrived along with Tsugumi and Anya to discover what Shaula and Meme had done: they had killed Sid.

He subsequently explains the rules and pronounces the start of the exam. Sid is so diligent in his duty that he easily notices and punishes Soul's cheating, who had written the answers all over his body. Except for this slight hiccup, the rest of the test goes without incident as far as Sid is concerned.

While she is currently attending to a paralyzed Maka, Sid enters and comments on how nice she looks in her new uniform, before asking if she had a minute. He silently mutters about new intelligence being received from Azusa Yumi, concealing his mouth as he does so, continuing to say that he can't say anymore with the others present.

Before the other has time to react, Sid drops down from the ceiling and breaks his neck in one simple movement. The two bodies disintegrate and their souls are absorbed into Mira's holster, as Sid informs Yumi of their current progression, to which she replies with detailed instructions and information about their target. Unexpectedly the alarm begins to sound, resulting in Sid uttering

   In a large scale conflict over the acquisition of

While Sid is requesting that his squad not lose concentration due to the effects of the island's magnetic field, they suddenly come under ambush from the enemy. Sid deftly avoids a swift sword swing to bury Mira, in her weapon form, deep into the opponent's chest, before grabbing the victim's head and repeatedly stabbing them in mere moments. Yumi, presently residing on Sid's back in her weapon form, brings his attention to their allies below who are on the verge of being annihilated just by Mifune.

   Adopting a higher vantage point, Sid takes aim and accurately fires at his intended prey, but Mifune easily deflects and recovers from the shot, proceeding then to quickly close the gap between himself and Sid. Sid blocks the subsequent strike using a concealed wrist protector and skillfully manages to connect with Mifune's arm, acquiring considerable distance from him by tunneling through the soft snow. Mifune gives chase and, while sliding down a steep cliff, Sid turns and fires multiple shots, issuing the challenge

These weapons easily and accurately pierce the ground below yet Sid manages an apparently successful escape, however, in the process he suffered a glancing wound to his abdomen. Never the less, he proceeds onwards towards the rendezvous point.

   When Mifune reaches this specified destination, he is subjected to various elements in a trap, concluding in Sid grabbing his feet from below as a large block of wood hurtles towards him. In order to keep his enemy in position, Sid suffers a grievous wound to his shoulder, but he quickly gains revenge on a bloodied Mifune by impaling his arm. The two face-off with other, trading words before preparing to begin their next round of fighting. However, observing DWMA's retreat signal the two see no reason to continue any further.
