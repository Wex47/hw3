He wears square-rimmed glasses and is seen with them both on and off. Being known for his physical fitness, he is quite well-built, though he tends to stand with poor posture, slouching over.

  <p key="63df168f-c899-475b-952a-02734f0fa4d9">
   Kilik's outfit consists of a short-sleeve shirt that appears to have either a shadowy
   Shinigami
   pattern across the sleeve ending or a joint lightning-fire pattern across the sleeve ending, with flame patterns on the right sleeve, lightning bolt patterns on the left. In later appearances, he simply has a plain white shirt with 'DC' (probably standing for Death City) written on the left breast. He also has a unique gold-coloured tribal-looking necklace, but, like his first shirt, this was removed in his later appearances. He wears grey pants with various decorative chains, a sweatband on each of his arms that covers almost the entire forearm and sneakers. On formal occasions, he wears a suit, but also wears a green baseball cap turned to the side as well.

He has the sleeves rolled up just below his biceps. He wears a long sweatband on each of his wrists that covers the majority of his forearms; one is light-patterned while the other is dark and light patterned. He was once seen with a small necklace in his shirt and a longer one outside his shirt alongside striped braces/suspenders that ran through his shirt collar. Lastly, he wears blue pants and white sneakers.

He quickly incapacitates the frontal attackers but a sudden
   Molotov cocktail
   from the rear forces him to leap between the small alley's walls and continue along the rooftops. Instantaneously, shots from an
   AK-47
   hammer the area but a well executed dive roll prevents any damage. As this occurs, an
   RPG
   is directed towards him, exploding and knocking him back some distance. This action provokes Kirikou into communicating with
   Kim
   for immediate evacuation but the attackers prevent this, so he once again flees, this time jumping through a lower window of the adjacent building. It is at this point that Azusa Yumi assumes control and dictates Kilik's next movements, resulting in him punching through a solid wall, just in time to catch
   Jacqueline
   's Weapon form. Everyone manages to fly to safety.

   Later, at a more secure location, the reunited group contemplate on the meaning of the research they have gathered and how it is related to their encounter with the crazed villagers. They deduct that Medusa is researching a way to control madness. However, the critical texts were missing in the laboratory, so in the end, Kilik thinks that they have found out nothing. While they are conversing, the
   Black Clown
   appears and the team lose contact with Azusa Yumi.

   Kilik immediately orders Liz, Patty, Fire, and Thunder to transform and for Kim and Jacqueline to back him up. Before he can begin the battle, he notices that his skin is seemingly liquidating and dropping to the floor. Kim compares the phenomenon to the kind of madness used by Arachne. Kilik focuses his mind and manages to break free from the illusion, pulls out the Thompson sisters and begins to shoot down the Black Clown. He switches to Fire and Thunder as the Clown comes closer, and he connects a punch. The released blood from the creature forms into numerous needles, and the Clown uses
   Bloody Needle
   , but Kilik safely evades. While his mind is on the Bloody Needle attack, the very same attack forms again but the blood is incinerated by Jacqueline's fire. Kim promises to take care of any counter-attacks from the Black Clown, and tells Kilik to attack it as much as he can.

   and relies on close combat. Kilik blocks the attacks and counters while Kim burns the Black Clown using
   Volantern
   . Kilik soon realizes that his attacks will not affect the creature. He retreats, while evading all the

   thrown at him from the Clown. He performs a Soul Resonance with Kim, who sends her magic to Fire and Thunder to awaken their
   Earth Shaman
   abilities. Once the twins transform into their mature adult forms, they each subsequently take hold of one of the Thompson sisters in their Weapon forms, producing visible manifestations of their elemental powers from the barrels of the guns. Kilik then proceeds to state the name of the attack,
   E3
   , signaling the twins to take aim and fire. A large beam emanates from both guns, travelling rapidly towards the Clown, which, upon impact, intermingle and create a massive explosion. This attack destroys most of the Black Clown, leaving only its head on the floor. As the team manage to contact Azusa Yumi again, Kilik proclaims the battle is over as the Black Clown disappears.

   Noah
   in the mission to capture Baba Yaga Castle. Upon entering the book, the team find themselves in the Introduction of the book. Here, they meet the
   Table of Contents
   , the entity in charge of keeping the Book of Eibon in order. The Table of Contents explains that Death the Kid is in the seventh Chapter of the book, and to reach him, they would have to traverse through all seven Chapters in the book, with each one having its own dangers. Kilik expresses his determination to save Kid, and informs The Table of Contents that they will not be turning back.

  <p key="d83e908d-bc1e-4f45-8955-41828b39737b">
   The Table of Contents acknowledges their determination and sends them on to the first Chapter, Lust, where everyone has their genders switched, taking on the form of their idea of a perfect sexual partner. Kilik is transformed into a girl in a female Spartoi uniform, and adopts a more serious, female-like personality. As the
   Succubus
   appears, the 'male' members of the team (who are originally female) begin to be allured by the creature's sexual appeal. Since he is now female, Kilik is not affected, and expresses dismay as the others are distracted. He then notices Blair, seeing that she does not look different at all in her cat form. However, in human form, Blair reveals to have changed into a strikingly handsome young man. The Succubus immediately falls for Blair, and the magic cat uses the opportunity to blast the creature away using her

   As the team continue on to the next Chapter, Gluttony, everyone realizes that even though they had left the Lust Chapter, they are still in their opposite genders, although their personalities have returned to normal. The Table of Contents explains that they will change back to their original form after leaving the Lust Chapter, and that the speed of the transformation depends on the individual's sexual desire: the stronger the desire, the slower the transformation. Kilik takes this in rather light-heartedly, stating, 'I guess we'll find out who's the horniest among us, eh? Should be interesting.' Tsubaki fervently argues that it is not.

   As Patty and Black☆Star begin to help themselves to the platters of food laid out in the Chapter, the team are confronted by a monstrous
   pig
   that is about to eat them. The team prepare to fight. However, after the pig states that its own flesh is of exceptional quality, Kilik, along with Black☆Star and Patty, decide to eat the pig instead. Black☆Star slices off one of the pig's arms, and Kilik fries it with Pot of Thunder, before taking a bite out of the roast meat. Black☆Star slices up the rest of the pig, and Kilik fries the pieces again. He gorges on the meat alongside Black☆Star and Patty. Before they can get drawn further into the sin of Gluttony, Soul has The Table of Contents move onto the next Chapter.

   Maka and Soul now get separated from the group and end up one Chapter behind. The rest of the group move on, and are next seen in the fourth Chapter, Wrath. The chapter ends up aggravating everyone, making them all fly into a rage. Kilik, along with the others, fight with each other, but soon calms down, commenting that the environment in the Chapter is completely red, and the color somehow makes him furious. The Table of Contents replies that red is the color that aggravates people the most.

   Everyone's anger is further put to the test when
   Excalibur
   appears in the Chapter. Although Kilik, along with the others, laugh at the Weapon for being captured, they are soon annoyed by Excalibur, and are further aggravated when Excalibur prevents The Table of Contents from continuing to the next Chapter. Kilik and the others manage to distract Excalibur long enough for the team to move to the fifth Chapter, Pride. However, to everyone's despair, Excalibur follows them.

   Excalibur offers the team a chance to save Kid quicker by using him as a Weapon. Liz decides to wield him and manages to open a crack into space with Excalibur. Kilik watches on with the others. However, Liz's pride gets in the way, and she ends up throwing Excalibur out the Book of Eibon. Liz laments over her mistake, as Kilik and the others stare on, not really concerned about the mistake.

   Kilik is later seen with the others in the seventh Chapter, Greed. He watches Liz transform back into her female form just a little quicker than Tsubaki, and teases Tsubaki along with Black☆Star and Patty because of this. Black☆Star casually states that it might be best to not sleep in the same room as Tsubaki anymore, and Kilik becomes envious as Black☆Star is sharing a room with a girl.
