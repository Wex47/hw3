   Tezca's initial appearance consists of both a dark suit—trousers and jacket—with a light-colored polo shirt. Tezca's most noticeable feature is his animal mask, initially that of a bear. The mask is decorated in plaid. With his mask, few of Tezca's actual facial features are visible. This mask results in his initial nickname upon his introduction.
   After his significant deception which involved faking his own death, Tezca exchanges the large bear mask of his typical attire with a similar one that is instead themed around a mouse with the intention of
   <i key="03727cbf-70b0-40d7-892f-d3daacc46635">

   himself.
   Continuing with this method of concealment, Tezca alters the style of his mask numerous times over the course of his pursuit before eventually settling upon one that depicts an enraged wolf.

   , Tezca returns in a strange form: disfigured, ghostly, and torn. His clothes are ripped, his animal form is exaggerated, and perhaps most surprising, his bones are exposed. From what can be seen from the many rips in Tezca's clothes, it appears that Tezca's actual body had reduced to bones, as his spine can be seen extending from his waist to his head. Existing only within mirrors, Tezca is now intangible, no longer physically present. Initially it seems that Tezca has added more than a head to his costume, as his arms and legs appear less human and more animalistic. As well, both hands and feet are bare and consist of only three digits, and a long tail emerges from Tezca. Whether this appearance is costumed or, as he exists in a mirror, a literal transformation of human into animal is not yet fully supported.
  </p>
  <p key="ab0cd460-9297-4f6a-9b97-a878d2816dd0">
   Tezca's new animal head has a more profound and jutting mouth with longer sharp teeth. The eyes lack pupils, instead containing multiple layers of circles that make Tezca appear mad.Although Tezca's animal head remains in its original location to revert to his initial ursine theme, exaggerated aspects of his appearance are seemingly not like those of a bear: his feet and hands are clawed, and he has a long tail. Therefore, while still resembling a bear, these details are more reminiscent of a jaguar In his new mirror form, Tezca's fabric pattern also changes, from plaid to a mixture pattern of numerous woven flowers and butterflies. Tezca's new attire consists of a pair of black pants, ripped to knee-length, and a relatively normal looking belt. While retaining his previous plaid shirt and jacket, they are ripped to elbow-length.

With Justin now removing his earphones in preparation for combat, Tezca asks once again for him to stop and not add further to his sins, but this is quickly rebutted by a guillotine to the chest. Naturally, Tezca was merely mirroring his body and instead creates multiple clones of himself, which Justin dismembers with similar ease. However, the fragments of these projections soon reform into a single and disturbingly deformed version of Tezca.

   Perceived as nothing more than a mere monster in light of his new form, Tezca declares that his accuser though hypocritical, has yet to descend to the rank of true abomination. Offering Justin his last opportunity at redemption and affirming that in spite of the chaotic circumstances, the information he has procured would surely lead to a reduction in his inevitable penance, Tezca pleads with him to make his return to the DWMA. Questioned about his insistent clinginess, he admits that although just a monkey, Enrique had always been a true companion with whom he shared both his thoughts and everyday life with. Asserting that this is a relationship Justin could never comprehend, Tezca continues by explaining that because of his preoccupation with worshiping Shinigami-sama, a god whose position meant that he couldn't reward him with the connection he truly desired, Justin became deaf to the voices around him. According to Tezca this inevitably led to his betrayal because as far as Justin was concerned, as long as he had belief to direct him, any god would do regardless of their doctrines. Calling such a
   raison d'être
   lower than that of a monkey, Tezca refutes the perplexed Justin's claims that one can live happily by embracing the god that is most convenient, suggesting instead that it could be found through the friendship he is currently offering.

Affirming that he will remove his earphones one way or another in response, he begins concentrating the sunlight with his mirror in preparation for an
   attack
   , before unleashing an incinerating beam that narrowly grazes Justin. Accused of still holding back in spite of the considerable possibility of fatal injury, Justin states that Tezca will find such an action regrettable, as the heat radiating from his true body makes it easy to discern. Refusing to neither run nor hide, Tezca is restrained and sentenced to the death in light of his transgressions, however, he indicates his belief that such a judgment belongs within the domain of gods and not human beings. Unconvincingly appealing to his executioner to stop, Tezca utters his final words "

   Later on, when Eruka meets Free again, Enrique is seen carrying an odd-shaped mirror with Tezca's face on the inset. He declares that now everyone is here, they should return to the Death Room. It is unclear if this is a new body that he has somehow obtained or he is simply reflecting his soul through an ordinary mirror.

    Tezca Tlipoca's name comes from the Aztec god
    Tezcatlipoca
    , a deity associated with the night, storm winds, and other dark and destructive forces, as well as with temptation and sorcery. He is often depicted in Aztec sources with a black stripe across his face and wearing a smoking obsidian mirror (according to myth, the mirror's smoke has the power to kill people). The name itself has a disputed etymology, but is generally agreed among Aztec linguist and historians that the
    <i key="82d8dc6e-c00b-40bb-ab31-c8ad86ac91f8">

    is the Nahautl word for "mirror" and the

    ("to emit smoke"). Hence, something like "The Smoking Mirror" is usually given as the translation of the god's name.

    It was originally believed that Tezca was the meister from South America and that his partner was instead a Death Scythe. However, this was later revealed to be the other way around, with Tezca being the weapon and his partner the meister.

    Tezca is a smoker of cigarettes and whose mirror powers allow him to burn so brightly that his mirror gives off smoke. As well, his final attack on Justin leaves that defected Death Scythe burnt and smoking along the left side of his face and his left shoulder for his remainder in the manga. This fits him, in which the diety he is named based off of wears a obsidian, smoking mirror.

    Tezca's latest costume could be a jaguar thanks to the numerous symbols on his "skin" resembling the spots of said feline (also, the long tail). Since the jaguar is one of the most important figures in Aztec mythology, it would go along with Tezca's theme. In addition, the deity Tezca is based off of,
    Tezcatlipoca
    , is symbolized by jaguars.

    Tezca does not appear in the anime version of Soul Eater and is only indirectly mentioned in
    Episode 25
    . In the episode, when Death asks Sid about the four absent Death Scythes, Sid states that he was not able to hear Tezca over the growling and barking.
