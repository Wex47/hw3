At the same time, Kid points Liz and Patty upward, shooting a ray of light from both of them, totalling the amount of rays to seven. These rays shoot upwards into the air, before dipping down and shooting towards the enemy. Unlike his

    Soul
    refers to this phrase when first meeting Kid, accusing Kid for getting everything he wants from his father. Parent's Seven Rays, is an attack used to symbolize that Death the Kid is not dependent upon his parents, in this case specifically his father, influence anymore.

    Despite Kid's obsession over symmetry, he shows absolutely no problem in performing this move, even though during Kid's and Soul's first meeting, Kid breaks down crying when Soul mentions the number seven, ironically, when he mentions the parents seven lights.
