   Initially, Masamune was a well mannered and caring individual and older brother who desired for Tsubaki, his younger sister, to express her actual feelings due to the fact he felt inferior and also felt that she held pity for him due to the fact he did not inherit the
   Multi-Form Ability
   and only went along with what he wanted in an attempt to make him feel great.
   As he got older, such feelings "forced" him to take the "

   and become superior to Tsubaki, whom he grew to have an inferiority complex over as well as having a deep-seated jealousy of her "power".
  </p>
  <p key="7a776b01-d932-4885-bf83-0dbc5a746839">
   He later grew the desired to become a Kishin and to "Master the Martial Way" in an attempt to becoming superior,
   a notion in which caused him to kill various human beings by exploiting their fears and allow them to wield him in his Uncanny Sword transformation, later devouring their souls.
   He also became a follower of the "survival of the fittest" philosophy, justifying his need to eat souls.
   Growing a darker personality, he would even for the most part have no sympathy or guilt in attack and even attempted to kill his sister.
   He also constantly berated her about her name, in which means "Camellia Blossom" and claimed that it was a petty flower with "no fragrance" that "quietly blooms without any point, and the way the petals falls off is miserable and hideous."
  </p>
  <p key="2bebe066-6567-4076-ac12-13ce278ebe2e">
   However, after Tsubaki showcased her feelings and pushed aside her care to take him down, Masamune realized that Tsubaki did indeed have a "wonderful fragrance" and accepted his sister prior to death, which was evident when he allowed Tsubaki to gain his transformation.

   Oddly enough, Masamune seems to enjoy writing poetry, specifically

  <p key="7752e1b9-a028-4b26-aea5-88764be3f844">
   In his first appearance, Masamune's outfit consisted of a long, ankle-length, white cloak and a large straw hat, similar in appearance to a Sandogasa. Unlike most Evil Persons, Masamune is mostly human in appearance minus the sickly, chalky skin tone that resembles that of other Evil Persons. In the world of his weapon form, his eyes become red with black pupils and sclera, and he develops long scratches and strikes all along his skin, giving it an manga-stylized appearance, even in the anime.
  </p>
  <p key="f5ddd7ce-1b71-475f-b183-d021fb58354d">
   Masamune has a rather unhappy-looking soul that is shown to be a magenta colour in the anime. It bears a long ponytail that acts as a method of latching onto and possessing a soul.

   Born as the first son to Sanjuro Nakatsukasa and his wife, Masamune would find that the his younger sister Tsubaki, for unknown reasons, inherited the Nakatsukasa Clan's
   Multi-Form Ability
   while he inherited the Uncanny Sword transformation, a fact which caused him to form immense jealousy for his younger sister.
   Despite this, he attempted to bond with Tsubaki throughout their childhood, finding that Tsubaki would follow his lead no matter her personal feelings. He took much of these acts as pity.

   At one point as both the siblings played ball, Masamune felt that although she said she wanted to play ball just like he did, he questioned if she really wanted to do so.
   One day, he would even reveal his intentions on
   mastering the martial way
   to Tsubaki personally.
   Mistaking her considerate nature for pity on his end for not inheriting the Multi-Form Ability, his envious nature remained even in his later years and soon influenced him to take the Path of the Uncanny Sword and work to evolve into a

   Meeting her inside the Uncanny Sword, he corrects Tsubaki and states his true intentions: eating her soul. He claims the idea of brothers and sisters fighting to claim one another's soul gives him the chills.
   Both of them then engage in battle, with Masamune taking the advantage and using it to spit insults at Tsubaki about the meaning of her name and the relation between her and flower itself. However, when met with eyes of sympathy, he claims he had no choice but to walk the Path of the Uncanny Sword.
   He also questions her usage of only a Chain Scythe, concluding that she is going easy on him based on pity before expressing how the Multi-Form Ability was passed to her and resulted in him, "a worthless piece of trash", being raised with "more care" before telling her he was going to kill her and master the Martial Way.

   Masamune goes for the killing blow but is surprised to find Tsubaki reinvigorated with spirit and intentions to stop him as well as no longer putting up with his insults and with him comparing her to an actual camellia blossom. She stabs him in the back with a ninja sword.
   Dealt a fatal blow, he smiles as Tsubaki finally expressed true feelings to him, coming to terms with the fact that the "fragrance" of a tsubaki flower (camellia blossom) is a wonderful fragrance before fading away.
   His soul is then absorbed by Tsubaki, who also gains her brother's power as a result.
