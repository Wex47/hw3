  </h2>
  <p key="ec5b0f3c-bfc4-41a6-99bd-f26af67fe72f">
   Patty acts and speaks like a young child, often using a singsong voice. She pronounces words like "hello" and "sorry", as a child would "hullo" and "sowwy", and seems to still be learning about simple things such as assigning animal noises to the right animal.
   This child-like disposition can lead to her coming across as nosy or insensitive, such as when she boldly asks if Crona is a boy or a girl .
   However, concepts past extremely basic ones may not have been explained to her due to her generally childish demeanour and inability to understand a lot of things, as exemplified by Liz congratulating her on simply getting animal names right.
   This lack of knowledge may be due to her growing up on the streets and presumably not having a formal education.
  </p>
  <p key="0dfe2d65-4ba4-4e64-9aa3-35f65cf48de7">
   Her current personality differs from the seemingly aggressive personality she had during her time in Brooklyn, developing her current personality after she met Kid. Unlike her sister Liz, Patty enjoys the drama brought on by Kid's perfectionist attitude; though she does cheer him up when he gets down on himself about it.
  </p>
  <p key="e4cbf58b-305e-46f4-8ad9-6230b6237660">
   She seems naïve and simple-minded, seeming not to take life seriously. While Patty had these traits before moving to Death City, such as being delighted that Kid referred to her and Liz as beautiful
   or patting her backside at people she robbed,
   such simplemindedness was far more violent and nefarious. With time working at

   , instead of answering questions, Patty took out crayons and began making an origami giraffe out of her test papers, then "broke its neck." When showering, she scrubs so much shampoo through her hair that she forms suds all over her body.
   She also seems fascinated by the smallest details, such as children's alphabet books
   or a hairclip.
   She frequently laughs, even when something bad happens. For example, when Kid bemoans his asymmetry and says he "want[s] to die," Patty responds with laughter: "Kya ha ha! ♪"
   and, at other times when he is depressed, even poking him with a stick.
  </p>
  <p key="25da0cee-b6bd-45a0-bf7b-0effde3f3a58">
   On the few occasions when she loses her temper, her childlike personality is replaced by an almost insane anger, as if her personality returns to how she behaved when a criminal in Brooklyn. Her demeanor can be so frightening that it scares Kid, even to the point of risking running through an asymmetric
   Tadpole Bomb
   minefield. Whether these qualities count as her own form of madness has yet to be clarified.
  </p>
  <p key="7d12e315-5085-49c1-9510-dbdbf8266f6a">
   When confronting some serious topics, and dangerous situations, Patty's childishly naïve personality is replaced with a more serious personality, suggesting that her bubbly personality may be a mask or merely how she wants to act. Upon learning that

   After finishing their shift, Patty along with her hang outside the cafe and spot the trio they served earlier. Both of them take the opportunity to pick on Anya, having picked up on her wealthy background based on her dress. Backing the three into a corner in an alleyway, Patty is present as Liz challenges all three of them as well as insult them. When Anya accepts the challenge, Patty is the one who transforms into her weapon form.

   Using Patty, Liz intimidates both Anya and Tsugumi and Patty watches as Liz chastises them on the concept of being unfair in a street fight. When Liz offers a free shot and Anya takes it, both of them switch places with Patty holding a gun to the back of her head. Citing that they're not fighting on equal footing, Patty shoots and intentionally misses. With Liz explaining that they're not wanting to get into serious trouble while on probation, both sisters let the trio go.

   As Liz complains how they are doing their best, she and Patty are approached by Tsugumi. As the Thompsons are confused why Tsugumi keeps returning to the cafe, Tsugumi explains that she is indeed afraid of the sisters, but she still admires their strength, considering them to be cool and beautiful, which impresses, even embarrasses, Patty and Liz. Supporting Tsugumi's point, new customers arrive who, despite knowing the Thompsons' poor service, are interested to see such attractive waitresses. Master then supports Tsugumi's point, reassuring Patty and Liz that they do not have to pretend to be nice or be tough because people in Death City are understanding, focused not on external appearances but on the soul itself. He then tells the sisters to get back to work.

While Patty and Liz still are brusch waiting on the students, the two at least take the students' orders. But neither one writes down the orders, still over-confident in themselves and ignoring what was said to them. Patty and Liz return with orders, Liz bragging that she has so much experience now working at Deathbucks that she can read people's faces for their orders. As Patty and Liz leave, Tsugumi and her friends trade orders: Liz got the correct orders, just to the wrong people (although Meme cannot remember her order).

   Later that day, Patty and Liz tend to another table where poorly behaving NOT students are disrupting Tsugumi's table. Patty and Liz threaten to beat the students. As those NOT students stand up, they see Master glare at them and quickly leave. Before Patty and Liz can turn around to see why the NOT students left without a fight, they see Master, who is now washing glasses, as if nothing happened.
   That same day, Patty and Liz are then joined by Tsugumi, Meme, Anya, and Jacqueline as waitresses to help with the increased number of customers—but they took so long to change into outfits that the customer rush has already been served.

Maka holds onto Asura's scarves and is pulled above ground, eventually knocked unconscious.

   Tadpole Bomb
   that explodes. Patty and Liz comment how big and fast the "worm" was that exploded out of the sand. Kid orders the sisters to transform into weapons before he rides Beelzebub to chase after the Runaway Express.
  </p>
  <p key="90dc2184-a94b-45ff-ad05-dcd0827b2b93">
   Unfortunately, the Runaway Express follows an erratic rather than linear path, crashing into the skateboarding Kid. As a result, the reaper calls upon Patty to transform back into human mode to keep an eye above them for additional aerial bombings and use Liz to shoot upon the Fisher King. Patty's attacks successfully impede the Fisher King's path to the engine room to acquire the demon tool Eternal Spring, and prevent him from firing back upon Kid.
  </p>
  <p key="38851a25-e75b-452a-8047-d3e04b245655">
   But then Kid directs his skateboard to a nearby sand dune, performing a 360-degree kickflip (and rattling Patty's nerves). Liz demands Kid stop his stunts before he flings off Patty, but Kid responds that he cannot pass up an opportunity to use the desert for at least one or two skateboard tricks. He convinces Patty to join him for a 3600-degree (ten-rotation) no hander, confusing the Fisher King until he sees that this trick allowed the two to helicopter onto the top of the train, successfully landing in a train car to face the Fisher King.

  <p key="1fefee79-b1bc-4e2a-a4b3-93487a8c45a9">
   Kid struggles to battle the Fisher King, who manages to disconnect that car from the rest of the train. The Fisher King fires his rail, latching his hook onto the locomotive's cars before they are out of sight and, with a "Goodbye," sails off from the rear cars to leave Kid behind. Kid tosses Patty and Liz at the Fisher King, instructing the Thompsons to transform and perform linkage: Liz grasps the Fisher King by the ankles, Patty her sister's, and Kid Patty's. The rear cars crash just as the extra weight on the Fisher King causes the four to drop and roll into the locomotive's cars.

In the girls' shower room, Patty listened to comparison of everyone's running time, including Liz complaining that Kid wanted eight seconds exactly. When Liz complained about gym in the morning compromising her desire to study in the afternoon, Patty said at least they get lunch first, then proceeded to scrub so much shampoo in her hair that her entire body was covered in suds. Patty then heard Maka refuse to join Liz in skipping class. When Liz assumed Maka was going to spend lunch studying in the library, Patty laughed that she should follow Maka's example.

   Upon entering the Book, Patty and her teammates meet the Table of Contents, who offers to guide them to Kid’s location, in the book’s Hidden Section. However, it warns her that this hidden section houses "the onset of madness," and to enter will require "paying a price." Patty, along with Kilik and Tsubaki, claim that they understand these risks and are willing to do what is necessary to save Kid.

   The Table of Contents speaks in an unknown language to open a portal to the book's first chapter, Lust. Inside, Patty and her teammates have their sexes changed, men becoming women, and women becoming men, all appearing in accordance with which characteristics they find appealing in that sex. Patty has shorter hair covered by a beanie hat. She also resembles her past psychotic self a bit more, as her eyes look slightly more crazed.

Patty grabs The Table of Contents, intending to punch the contraption. Liz then notices something moving within the twisted structures around them. Liz clutches Patty, who thinks Liz looks humorous as a man when so frightened. From the curtains, the

   pig
   , who says it will test the mettle of their souls, as it slices at the two with a cleaver. Shocked to face a pig that desires to cut, cook, and consume these students (and is naked under just an apron), Patty and Black☆Star wield Liz and Tsubaki (as Patty realizes Liz feels the same in gun form despite her change of sex, as Liz says guns are clunky regardless of gender). Realizing that they can eat the pig, Patty and Black☆Star, along with Kilik, kill and consume the pig, becoming more and more mad for food. Soul orders the Table of Contents to transport them out of the Gluttony Chapter.

   Upon transportation, the team is separated: Maka and Soul are sent to the Envy Chapter, while Patty and the rest are sent to the Wrath Chapter.
   Patty, as well as Black☆Star and Kilik, are back to their previous sexes, while Liz, Tsubaki, and Blair are still male. Patty, Black☆Star, and Kilik are furious: they are hungry, and she cannot stand Black☆Star and Kilik's complaining. Patty, Black☆Star, and Kilik also call Liz a "horny-ass cougar" and a "typical blonde" with a "goddamn hissy fit.” Patty and Black☆Star then demand that the noise stop. But her fury only increases as the other captive of the Wrath Chapter is revealed:

Patty, Black☆Star, and Kilik, infuriated, promise to distract the Holy Sword. But as the three try to grab Excalibur, the weapon leaps away, thinking the three are wasting time with a game. As the three yell that it is Excalibur wasting time, The Table of Contents completes its message, causing the Wrath Chapter to flip to the next chapter.

   Unfortunately, Excalibur follows Patty and her teammates into the Pride Chapter, cause her to freak out more. Excalibur offers to help them escape, offering himself to Liz as the
   Holy Sword

   The team then is transported by the Table of Contents to the Greed Chapter, where Patty continues to mock Liz and Tsubaki for still being men, which means they are "nymphos.” When Tsubaki is the last to transform into a woman again, Liz joins Patty in mocking Tsubaki. Tsubaki responds by holding a kunai threateningly at the Thompsons.

   Back in the Greed Chapter, Liz remembers how she and Patty first met Kid, and how he saved them from thugs. Instead of destroying/capturing them, like he was sent to do, he asked them to be his weapon partners and gave them a chance to redeem themselves. She and Patty had been planning on using Kid's Shinigami status to gain the money and power they craved, believing he was just a spoiled brat. However, the more time they spent with Kid, the more they grew to care for him, a fact Liz realizes after watching Patty laugh herself to tears.

   It begins to rain money down on the group, and Liz thinks to herself that she doesn't care about money, all she wants is for Kid and Black☆Star to return safely. Patty and Tsubaki ask if she's ok, and she begins to cry, saying "I haven't thanked him yet." Both girls simply smile and pull her into a hug. Liz says "Kid" and begins crying more openly and is shaking.

On Patty and Liz's next Death Cannon shot, Auntie follows it, jumping through the wall before Kaguya can reform her raiment. Strapped to a parachute case full of bombs, Auntie detonates the explosives. Once the debris clears, Patty, Liz, and Kid are surprised to see Auntie has survived and is back on her feet. Moonlight is destroyed as well, but Kaguya is still standing. And Kaguya now sees someone standing behind Auntie: Justin Law. Auntie senses his presence even before Patty, Liz, and Kid can warn her. But it is too late: Justin's guillotine has sliced her at the waist, killing her. Justin tosses her corpse down, allowing it to reform into Auntie's soul, which Justin's flames consume.

   After yelling at Justin because of this murder, Kid renews his attack against Kaguya and other Clowns, using Patty and Liz's shots with increased fury. Although sweating with some fear, Kid smiles. While he desired to beat out of Kaguya the information about Asura's location, Kid says he need not do so: "Auntie taught me the way." Kid's grin curls upward, his outfit darkening and a familiar cravat appearing around his neck: as he resembles how he did when facing the Great Old One of Power, Kid feels madness take ahold of him. Kid dashes forward, blasting away clowns with Patty and Liz in demon pistol form. One of the Thompsons warns Kid that White Rabbit and another clown are approaching Kid, who already sees the two, knocking them down. While madness has empowered Kid, he worries that, without Maka Albarn's Anti-Demon Wavelength in Chain Resonance, madness will soon overwhelm him.

But he surprised when the clown simply chuckles. As happened before, the remains of the clowns dig into the Moon's surface, forming into orbs topped with flames, then reform from the surface as Clowns: the ones Kid just killed are reformed. Kaguya mocks Kid, claiming he cannot defeat the clowns due to Asura's infinite madness, and Kid too will inevitably fall into that madness.
