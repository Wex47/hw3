      I used to think as long as we were together, Patty and I would always be able to laugh.... that we could have a fun and crazy life, just the two of us... I never thought we needed anyone. I use to hate everyone else... I use to wish we could make them all disappear forever... Patty laughed so hard that day... it was like she was making up for all the years before. Looking back..... I think maybe the Shinigami did take our lives after all... in a sense...

She can also be a little cynical, jaded, and shallow sometimes (but not always), and sometimes takes advantage of other people for her own gains, like when she pretends that

   She is the older and more mature of the two sisters. Kid's obsession with symmetry and how he will let it control his life sometimes gets on her nerves and she frequently reprimands Kid for this, although she won't hesitate to cheer him up when he is depressed. She also displays wit, courage and determination whenever her friends are in danger, and tries her best to protect them.

   Liz has dirty blonde hair that reaches her mid-back, dark blue eyes, and slightly sun-kissed skin. Although taller and older than Patty, she has a smaller breast size, which annoys her when noticed by Kid, along with his groping of her breasts.
   Upon her arrival in Death City, she is 170 centimeters tall (about 5 feet 7 inches).

   During their initial missions with Kid, both Liz and Patty wear cowgirl outfits: tight, sleeveless red turtleneck belly shirts with white ties, cowboy hats and black high-heel boots. However, unlike Patty, Liz wears dark wash jeans and two silver bracelets on each wrist. In addition, there is a subtle difference in their hats. Patty's hat has rounded rims, whilst Liz's hat has rims that slant forward. In the anime, as the series progress, both Thompson sisters wear cropped white jackets over their outfits. Liz's soul has a pink color and has two curved triangles representing her hat.

   When "studying" for the Super-Written Exam (she mostly procrastinated through all of it), she changes into a purple business outfit with a headband brushing back her hair, two heeled shoes and a pair of reading glasses. This is referred to as her "smart-girl transformation". Her glasses have not been seen again for the rest of the series, so whether she requires reading glasses or not has as of yet not been clarified. Saying this, they are referred to as 'fashion glasses' or 'glasses for looks' in the manga. However, she is shown to be intelligent enough to pass the Exam without studying as much as the others, scoring higher than Patty, Black☆Star and even Death the Kid, who admittedly, couldn't even write his name.

Also, she along with Tsubaki remain in their opposite gender form the longest, revealing that they are the most lustful out of the group. However the most lustful of them is Tsubaki, as Liz turns back to normal slightly before Tsubaki.
