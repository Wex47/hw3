   He also was an individual never hesitated in helping a student and inspire them to unleash their latent potential.
   He also described himself as a stubborn individual, and that is the "

While he initially portrayed himself to want to kill his students for them to be relieved of the fear of death, this ended up being a ruse in which the remedial lesson was to strengthen them, a part he played in willingly to help his students grow stronger.
   In addition, Sid carries himself as a professional and follows orders to the letter, a case he would use to spare

   When Sid was alive, he was a muscular, dark-skinned young man with cornrowed hair and black Japanese tattoos on both his arms which still remain in his zombie transformation. The kanji shown in the tattoo on his shoulder stands for "death", and the arrow under it stands for "person". He also possessed with a headband that had the writing meaning "hole" upon it but, after his transformation into a zombie, an actual hole through his head is now present where the writing once appeared.

  <p key="8b7058ed-3588-4270-b8a2-303dfbbc2cd5">
   After becoming a zombie, his skin has adopted a bluish tone and his face is composed of a flat, piggish nose, with pupilless white eyes and a mouth that persistently displays his top and bottom teeth. Despite being undead, he still retains the full extent of both his hair and physical build.

   Although Sid's clothing remains largely the same no matter what his own current condition is, it changes drastically to suit what the day-to-day circumstances entail. During normal everyday proceedings, he is commonly seen wearing blue jeans with a small chain hanging from one side and sneakers, accompanied by one of his various tops. Earlier in the series, this top is a
   simple white basketball jersey, embellished with a red number "23"
   on either side or his forename higher up on its back. Later, this changes to a red t-shirt with the image of a white, silhouetted tombstone upon either side while the word "tomb" is shown within the design on the front. Aside from his top, he is normally seen with a beanie hat, likely to cover the hole through his forehead. However, when conducting an operation for

   , Sid dons more appropriate garments befitting his present role. These typically comprise of an entirely black, sleeveless flak jacket, military combat pants and combat boots. These are accompanied by a forehead protector, iron bands encircling his wrists and further metal protectors on his ankles.

   After more weeks of intelligence gathering, Sid noticed details about the thefts of paperwork and research at the Death Weapon Meister Academy, indicating a potential suspect: Meme Tatane, whose sleepwalking habits were similar to the trance that Shaula's Traitors seemed to have. Sid coordinated a late-night sting at the Academy, drawing the sleepwalking Meme to the location while he posted his DWMA agents at the Academy's exit and snipers across the street on rooftops. Although the sleepwalking, hence possessed, Meme arrived, she was followed by Tsugumi and Anya. As Meme's actions were revealed, Shaula controlled Meme to have her attack her friends and escape the Academy, while Shaula herself possessed Sid's very snipers to attack the entrance guards.

   As Meme escaped the Academy, Sid followed her to the Square of Liberty in Death City. He was followed by his agents—but Sid then realized that Shaula had possessed them as well. Confronting the witch herself, Sid could not defeat her before she stabbed him with her venom. Rather than control Sid, however, Shaula said his strong will made him a poor candidate as one of her minions. Therefore, she commanded Meme to remove the replica of the Statue of Liberty based in the Square and stab its torch through Sid's head. The explosive sound of this attack alerted Akane and Clay who arrived along with Tsugumi and Anya to discover what Shaula and Meme had done: they had killed Sid.

   Some time later, rumors had become rife within DWMA about various strange occurrences, all surrounding a recently deceased teacher. The rumors said that he got the idea of absolute freedom stuck in his head and started attacking students to show them the amount of freedom dying had brought him.

This takes the form of cleaning DWMA's huge library which, of course, Black☆Star isn't overly happy with. However, Sid simply reasons that by not completing such lessons it is unfair on Tsubaki and so if he doesn't like it, he should just change his ways.
