   having primarily male main characters. He also paired her with Soul (along with other main characters having a male/female pairing) to demonstrate an equal representation of gender. Maka's fighting style with a scythe was given for it's uniqueness and resisted drawing influences from other people regarding his main protagonists, inlcuding Maka.

  <p key="196bf32b-4b0f-4ac2-8fec-c49361228edc">
   Maka's surname, Albarn, may be an allusion to Damon Albarn, a musician of the British group Blur and co-creator of the virtual band Gorillaz, including the singing voice for Gorillaz's lead singer 2D. This is one of many musical allusions that Atsushi Ohkubo includes in the manga.

   and tends to look down on such behaviors, often calling them idiots.
   Out of all the main protagonists, she is seen mostly as the most "normal" of the cast. It's been stated by multiple people like her own father that many of her good qualities come from her mother and even possess a mindset in which once she starts, barely anything stops her.
   In the anime, it is expressed her best quality is her bravery by Crona.

  <p key="812b3fa3-b7ad-47b7-a6da-3eaac7e7b21f">
   Despite this, Maka herself possesses flaws and insecurities. She has been noted by her partner to be stubborn and gloomy and is sometimes prone to make decisions without regarding others' feelings if she feels justified enough.
   She also views the typical male sex negatively, finding them to be nothing more than "pigs" looking only at the sex appeal of females,
   a notion in which may have manifested thanks to her father's lecherous actions and cheating on her mother. She also can be said to have temper issues, occasionally striking out those who annoy her with her

   She is also not above breaking the rules, such as taking advantage of her father's status to check out a book beyond her rank though did so to try to help Crona, but ended up checking out the Book of Eibon's Manuscript and knew it was not only a bad idea but felt guilty about it so ended up leaving "M" as her signature.
   Having taken immediate interests in the revelation of possessing a
   Grigori Soul
   , Maka was described by Soul as "obsessed" with the "angel stuff" until she found her new-found mindset hindering her ability to fight a fellow possessor of the Grigori, Gopher.
  </p>
  <p key="8b7623ab-ee0e-4f65-b222-2f9765855916">
   One of the her main insecurities seen early on was her fear of her partner, Soul, being the one who "carried" her throughout her battles. So much so she strove at one point to get stronger to the point of ignoring her partner's personal views on the situation and blamed herself for Soul falling to Crona and
   Ragnarok
   during their first fight.
   She also struggled with accepting her partner's celebrity status as a Death Scythe, feeling that he became one because of his own efforts with her contribution being useless. She became jealous of not only Liz sharing the same interest in music and understanding it better with Soul, but also Patty's ability to be an even better fighter than her.
   This caused her to break down so much, she was almost willing to let
   Giriko
   sexually assault her and was initially unwilling to help Soul fight the adversary until she came to her senses. Despite being close to her father as a child,
   much of their relationship became strained when he cheated on her mother
   and made her secretly fear rejection from people she cared about, most notably her Demon Weapon partner, Soul.

   Maka is a flat-chested, teenage young woman with light taupe hair which she keeps in pigtails, although there are certain times she may stylize them into buns or wear them straight down. Maka's primary outfit is a typical schoolgirl outfit consisting of a white blouse with a yellow sweater vest, a green striped tie, a red plaid skirt, and black boots with white buckles. When using Soul, she usually wears white gloves. Maka also wears a trench coat with a cloak-like end (which alters its shape in various parts of both the manga and anime). In her initial appearance in the first chapter, her trench coat was so long that, when buttoned up, it seemed that she was not wearing a skirt.
  </p>
  <p key="c7b8ffce-726a-4dfc-a738-a0ae1a767ac0">
   When Maka joins Spartoi, her outfit changes, though it still shows similarities to her previous attire. Maka's Spartoi uniform is very similar to that of a Japanese schoolgirl's sailor uniform with the colouring of the classic Spartoi uniform: a white blouse attached with a blue sailor-style collar with a red necktie that has a pink coiled tip and a short, blue, pleated skirt. Alongside this uniform, Maka wears black tights and the classic white Spartoi shoes, but stops wearing tights a few chapters later. Like her previous outfit, Maka wears a long trench coat, though it is white instead of black and has the Spartoi logo on the left shoulder as well as the fact that the cloak end splits in two. Her pigtails are fashioned using skull hairbands similar to

   Maka's soul, when viewed by Stein, has an orange-like colour and has her signature pigtails.
   Some comments from Ragnarok and Maka herself suggest that Maka's soul is quite small, especially when compared to those of others, such as Black☆Star's (although, like others, her soul grows in size considerably after she grows more powerful). When resonating with Soul, these "ponytails" turn into wings, revealing her soul to be a
   Grigori Soul
   , and her Soul Wavelength takes on the form of feathers.

When Death comes to pick up his son, Kid, Maka takes the opportunity to see his soul. She, however cannot see it and leaves it at that. What she does not know, however, is that the reason she cannot see Death's soul is because it covers the entirety of the DWMA.

To make the game more interesting, Soul brings up the idea of a bet for each of the teams' respective captain to follow if they lose. If Kid's team loses, they will put the paintings on Kid's walls in his mansion off by 1 in; if Maka's team loses, she has to go shopping with her father. Ultimately, Kid's team wins, since Maka, having never played basketball, easily loses as she does not know the rules.

   Maka recovers from her condition and is seen in Stein's class as he is about to start a lesson. The group discuss on how Black☆Star had been picking a lot of fights recently with the other students. However, Stein, much to everyone’s shock, throws a scalpel in their direction and tells them to focus on the lesson. Black☆Star arrives late and is told to stand outside for the time being. The lesson is about Duel Art and he plans to teach the class by using Black☆Star, Maka and Soul, and Ox and

During the battle, Black☆Star is subject to many accidental assaults via both Ox and Maka, with Ox accounting for the lion's share of the assaults. Maka ends up being electrocuted by Ox's

Maka defends her love of, 'The Pon Poko Dance,' which is immediately made fun of by the others. She attempts to bring Crona into the conversation, but they quickly retreat and excuse themselves.

With this said, Maka warns Black☆Star in particular to do this properly, but he insists that he always does. Despite this, the three students fail multiple times, which angers Maka. She believes that Black☆Star is the blight of the failures. She starts arguing with him, but Kid steps in between them, and Stein decides to give them a break to cool down.

Maka tries to punch him again, and this time, Black☆Star allows her to hit him. Black☆Star then warns Maka that, if this goes on any further, it sould be a duel, and he would be sure to crush her.

   On her own, Maka secretly talks of her envy of Black☆Star and how he can become so strong without being concerned about anything around him. She is soon visited by Tsubaki. She asks him what she thinks of Black☆Star. Maka replies simply by saying that he ticks her off. Tsubaki pauses, before saying that Black☆Star actually does study before tests, which surprises Maka as he always gets zeroes. She asks Tsubaki why he never gets good grades, and Tsubaki admits that she does not know. Maka laments, saying that she will never understand Black☆Star if even Tsubaki cannot understand him. Tsubaki says that friends do not need to understand each other all the time. Realizing her mistake and on how to achieve a true Chain Resonance, Maka eagerly decides to return to the others, and Tsubaki wonders if it was necessary for her to come in the first place. However, Maka, on the way, panics, wondering on how to apologize. Tsubaki ends up dragging her, saying that she does not need to think about it since she will probably end up fighting with Black☆Star again. She is then met by Soul. She asks him if he had come to laugh at her, and Soul pauses before replying that the laughter should wait until after they had succeeded the Chain Resonance. Returning to the group, she apologizes to Black☆Star, who forgives her. The group resume their training and succeed, with Maka not trying to understand them, but putting her life in their hands and trusting them. Stein then makes Maka the leader of the group.

Ox replies that if they go in the field, the enemies will follow and the battle will get out-of-hand, leading to people being lost because of staying in the field for too long.

Maka protests, but has no choice but to agree. Since Mosquito can revert to an even younger form of himself, he can remain in the vortex for longer, and the group have no choice but to retreat without Brew.

Maka is forced to see visions of the deaths of her friends and family, in an attempt to drag her deeper into madness. However, Soul manages to reach her with his Wavelength. Maka meets with Soul in her mind, both dressed as if they are in the Black Room, with the exception that Maka's face is partly covered by the Clown's mask after being influenced by the madness. Having her sit at a piano, Soul tells her that the songs he plays are of madness. Maka protests that although she does not know much about music, she likes Soul's songs. Soul explains to her how madness gives people strength, but beneath the insanity, when the soul endures the darkness, is a strength that is even more intriguing. Maka calls this strength courage, and Soul tells her that they should have Crona know of courage too. Soul takes Maka's hand and tells her to let him listen to her soul. Maka touches a key at random, which is a G. Due to the influence of Soul's Wavelength, Maka's courage allows her to break free of the illusions. The two resume their fight against the Clown.

Maka is immediately attacked by Medusa. Medusa reveals that she used Crona as an incentive for Maka's cooperation. Medusa then states that Maka's abilities are a threat to her and the world's progress to madness. Before Medusa can finish Maka off, she is attacked by

   then enters and warns Medusa of the oncoming the DWMA forces. Medusa takes him up on the advice and leaves. Before leaving, Maka asks where Crona is. Medusa tells her to give up, going on to say that the Crona she knows no longer exists and that she will never give Crona up. Maka punches the ground in anger and laments over her mistake to trust Medusa, as Soul comforts her.

   After becoming a Death Scythe, Maka and Soul begin to understand what exactly the implications of this means. They are seen outside with Marie, and Kim flying. Maka suggests that because Soul is a Death Scythe now, that he should be able to fly with ease. Marie objects, telling them that becoming a Death Scythe is not something so simple. She continues, saying that the advanced wavelength control that a Death Scythe obtains from a Witch Soul can grant magical abilities. If she can use the
   Grigori
   form her soul takes and imply it with all of that, they may be able to manifest wings. Marie calls Maka an angel at one point, which awakens Maka's desire to become like one, much to Soul's annoyance. Maka protests that with Ox calling Kim an angel all the time, it would be nice if she is called one as well. Spirit also comes along to watch their training.
  </p>
  <p key="4339bdb8-0a9b-44e1-9fd2-6405fa8ff9b4">
   In beginning the training, Soul transforms into his Weapon form. He has a slightly different form now, more so where his 'eye' is located in his Weapon form. They are then told their souls must be synchronized in order to complete the task. They must both focus on the same image, of Kim flying. While doing this, the scythe blade on Soul shrinks. Marie explains that form manipulation is basic for a Death Scythe and that they must have decided that the long blade is not necessary for flight. After, both Maka and Soul create sharp, blade-like wings at the end of Soul's Weapon form. However Soul, upon being told by Spirit to imagine Maka as an angel, instead thinks of the somewhat negative things she has done. Maka then starts spinning upside down in circles until they both fall, due to Soul losing concentration. They still argue about whose fault it is. Maka then rants about how she had wanted angel wings instead of the spiky ones that appeared. They argue again which leads to Maka saying she had wished she was partnered with Ox. Soul does not understand this as Ox is a Meister. Later, at the DWMA, Maka is still fantasizing on how she is now considered an angel Soul still telling her to drop the idea. They are then later called by Spirit to discuss something.

   Soul is seen once again with Maka practicing flying with Kim. Despite the extremely slow speed given by the tiny wings, Maka is thrilled to have the fluffy angel wings she desires. Prior to this, Spirit speaks to them about the many enemies they have such as the witches (more specifically Medusa), the new group Noah has formed, and the Kishin. Spirit warns them that they aim to take out talented people on their side as well, meaning Maka is also a target. Maka's advanced Soul Perception is the reason for her being targeted, and that it is their trump card against the Kishin. Spirit explains that the DWMA must protect Maka at all costs. After making a remark about her father, saying that he wants to protect her because of her abilities, Maka leaves the room. Spirit then asks Soul to watch over Maka. Going back to the training, Soul tells Maka that he believes her father cares more about her safety than her ability. They then continue on talking about the many responsibilities they have still to do, such as saving

   overwhelming Soul and Maka with his tremendous speed. Not too soon after, Gopher charges up a powerful attack in the center of his chest, aimed at Maka. Soul and Maka manage to dodge the attack with the mountain behind taking the impact. Soul remarks that Gopher is not ordinary, and Maka then explains that Gopher also has the same angel type Grigori Soul as she does, but filled with evil magic. Gopher then launches another barrage of
   attacks
   at the two. Soul and Maka attempt to attack but are once again outmatched in speed and take a hit by Gopher's barrage. Soul begins to talk about their difference in speed and it may be helpful if they bring the fight to the ground. Maka realizes the full meaning of Soul's words that they are not ready yet as they are losing the battle. Now irritated by the small angel wings, she demands Soul to create new ones. Soul grins and complies, and the two perform a
   Soul Resonance
   , creating larger and more powerful wings. The two then prepare to continue the fight, with Maka telling Gopher that the real battle begins now.

  <p key="c50cc542-48ba-45b6-83ed-20d3be482d01">
   After witnessing Maka create a new pair of wings, more suitable for battle, Gopher now realizes why Maka is wanted by Noah. Jealous of this realization, Gopher once again goes on the offense. Maka's new pair of wings allows her to easily dodge his attack and all attacks following it. Immediately, Gopher is forced on the defensive after Maka delivers numerous hits, which includes a Witch Hunter. Angered that the body
   Noah
   made for him has been damaged; Gopher prepares another one of his stomach cannons, with this one specially installed with his hatred of her. Driven by Gopher's hatred, the ball of energy follows Maka everywhere. This prompts Maka to perform Majin Hunt and proceeds to slice through the ball of energy. Maka continues her attack and manages to inflict a shallow wound on Gopher. When Soul asks why she held back in the end, Maka replies that he is not on Shinigami's wanted list. Maka then witnesses Gopher retreat via a page from the Book of Eibon.

   Back at the DWMA, Maka sees the large amount of requests that female Meisters have sent to Soul for him to be their partner in his locker. She expresses her amazement at the sheer amount, and states that although Soul usually got love letters like these, they had increased dramatically in recent times. Soul grumpily replies that it's only because he has become a Death Scythe. Maka pauses, before thumping her partner's back (hard) and suggesting they go home. As they leave, a
   mysterious girl
   watches the two, and she deems Maka incompatible for Soul.

   Later, Maka complains that since she was the one who made Soul a Death Scythe, she should be getting some request letters too. Soul states that Maka's lack of sex appeal is the problem, and compares her to Blair,

   The two later hide and watch Marie and the two Witches go in, and watch the doors of the Death Room. They soon see Marie storm out in a temper, and then sees Black☆Star and Tsubaki approaching the closed doors. Black☆Star breaks the door down, even though there is a sign saying that no one must enter. Soul proposes they should just go in too, but Maka replies that sneaking around is much cooler, comparing herself to a heroine in a mystery novel. Soul soon gets bored and calls it all a waste of time. Maka spots the mysterious girl still spying on them, and wonders what she's up to, having noticed her already with her Soul Perception.
It is here revealed that Maka was actually the one who secretly took out the Level 4 book from the Library, which was the Book of Eibon manuscript that Death the Kid thought was originally stolen by Medusa. She apologizes to Shinigami for this, and tells him not to blame Spirit (who’s ID card she used to borrow the book). She begs Shinigami to let her go on the mission to help save Kid. Shinigami, with some persuasion, complies. Maka, determined to rescue her friend, tells the rest of Spartoi that, 'This is for Kid!'

   Maka, along with Soul, Kirikou, Pot of Fire and Pot of Thunder, Black☆Star, Tsubaki, Liz, Patti and Blair, are sent into the Book of Eibon to save Kid. There, the group meet
   The Table of Contents
   which informs them that they need to traverse through the seven chapters of the book in order to save Kid. The group soon enter the first Chapter, Lust, and Maka has her gender changed, based on everything she sees desirable in the opposite sex. Surprisingly, she resembles Soul(without his hair styled with hair gel) a little which further implies that she has some feelings for him, and with her new male temperament, she immediately gets a nosebleed upon seeing the Succubus, much to Soul's annoyance.
  </p>
  <p key="186b2c08-4a6e-4e00-b734-e45e094d44b9">
   After passing through the Lust Chapter and into the second Chapter, Gluttony, Maka realizes that although they had left the Lust Chapter, she still appears male, although her personality has returned to normal. The Table of Contents explains that they will only gradually return to their original gender depending on the intensity of their sexual desire. The more intense it is, the slower one changes back. Maka snidely passes off the comment that Soul would probably change the slowest. She almost succumbs to the large amount of food on display in the Chapter, and barely manages to control herself.

  <p key="b81d697b-fcc8-40a1-84de-09bd3fdc0b2b">
   Maka ends up getting separated from the rest in the third Chapter, Envy. She finds herself caught up in an illusion based upon her envy. She ends up in a fake the DWMA, and is approached by the mysterious girl she had seen spying on her and Soul. The girl tells her that she is not worthy of being Soul's partner, and how little she understands Soul. Maka protests this, saying that she reads lots of music books in order to understand Soul more. However, when commanded to spin a nearby broom like she does with a scythe, Maka surprisingly fails to do so, which results in the girl mocking her, saying that she is only a bookworm that always needs to have Soul helping her. Maka remembers how Soul had always needed to help and lead her, and the girl reveals that she is envious of people who understand music like Soul, in contrast to Maka who, in a flashback, shows that she does not reciprocate Soul's appreciation for music. Convinced by the girl of her worthlessness, Maka breaks down in tears.

   Soul arrives at this point and asks her if something is wrong. Maka pretends that everything is fine. Soul tells her not to become separated this time and he takes her hand, moving on to the next Chapter.

   The two are next seen in the sixth Chapter of the Book of Eibon, Sloth. Soul drags Maka along, but soon, Maka gets teary, still upset by her previous experience, and stops Soul, saying that she needs to tell him something. She apologizes to Soul for dragging him back, before sitting down, and to Soul's shock, asks him to leave her behind and says that she cannot fight alongside him anymore.
  </p>
  <p key="a1463db5-9f58-4d2c-868c-36d1352839c1">
   When Soul asks her why she is suddenly saying this, Maka apologizes again and says that none of it is his fault and that she is to blame. She tells him to split up with her. Soul is unnerved by Maka's statement and tells Maka not to spout a lot of nonsense just because of an illusion in a book. Maka replies that Soul must have seen something in the chapter of Envy as well, and Soul, put off a little, denies that he saw anything.

  <p key="bd529b8e-caa6-4240-9cc0-468c0ccf7bc2">
   However, before their conversation can continue, Giriko attacks both of them. After kicking Soul aside, Giriko pins Maka down on the bed grabbing her wrists, saying that instead of waiting ten years, he is going to 'make her scream' right now. To his surprise, Maka replies, 'Do what you want,' which enrages Giriko, since she does not fear him, and he proceeds to kill her. Before he injures Maka, he is intercepted by Soul, and he transforms into his Weapon form as Maka prepares to fight. However, still emotionally distressed from the Envy chapter, she is unable to concentrate, and ends up leaving herself open for Giriko's attacks. When Giriko, tired of Maka's lack of determination, tells her that he will finish her off quickly, Soul suddenly transforms back into human form and Maka looks on shocked as Soul tells her that he will fight Giriko on his own.

   Predictably, Giriko proves to be stronger than Soul, and ends up wounding the Death Scythe several times. Maka looks on, dumbfounded as Soul, after a powerful blow by Giriko, falls to the floor at her feet. However, Soul still gets up, voicing his frustration on his inability to do anything for Maka. However, he states that this is not the sort of courage that Maka had shown to him. Determined to show his own courage this time, he stands up again to fight. Soul's words bring Maka back to her senses. With a resolute expression on her face, she mentally berates herself, calling herself an idiot for not believing in Soul just because she had seen an illusion in a book.

   She then proceeds to apologize to Soul, who forgives her and begins to attack Giriko again with new resolve, but is still distraught over the Envy Chapter and is starting to lose when Soul comes up with a plan to intercept Giriko's Soul Wavelength by using his piano and Arachne's ability to spread Wavelengths via webs. Maka then uses her Soul Perception on Giriko and Soul plays his piano and uses it to stop Giriko. Maka then proceeds to cut him in half and he then explodes. Believing Giriko is defeated she begins to walk away now feeling less distraught over the Envy Chapter. Then a now female Giriko comes up from behind and cuts Maka's back. He then explains that he had had another body for himself for backup in case something like this happened, and being in the Chapter of Sloth, Maka had not realized this as she had been too sloppy with her Soul Perception. He says that he is disappointed that he is a 'big-titted female' and says that people do not explode when they die. Maka then says that Arachne had exploded when she died. Giriko responds by praising Arachne, saying that she had been, 'something else,' and wonders if Maka would explode when she dies. Maka and Grikio continue to fight, but Maka starts to lose as she proceeds to acquire more injuries and Soul's piano is destroyed by Giriko's Wavelength. She begins to lose hope, convinced that she will die. However, before Giriko can kill Maka, his soul, not being able to take eight hundred years of rage, begins to rupture. Maka sees this using Soul Perception and then proceeds to slightly mock Giriko, telling him to sit down and rest, as there are many chairs and beds in the Sloth Chapter. Giriko, enraged, tries to kill her, but his soul explodes before he can do so, leaving Giriko's body as an empty shell. Maka laughs at his demise and is later seen carried by Soul on his back after the battle.

Although Sid and the others tell them to run, Black☆Star and Death the Kid decide to fight Noah and his monsters. Death the Kid asks Maka and Soul to help the two, and Maka is surprised as they activate the Insanity Wavelength in them. Soul asks if Maka can pull it off in her injured state with Maka replying that she has to. Holding Soul in Weapon form, she forms a Chain Resonance and supports Black☆Star and Death the Kids' sanities with her courage, whilst giving the two advice during the battle.

Maka laments over Crona's actions, and holding back tears and mentally calling Crona an idiot, tries to cut into the spheres with Majin Hunt. However, the moment Soul touches the spheres; he becomes insane due to the Black Blood and returns to Stein and the others, pulling her by the pigtail.

   Maka senses the insanity coming out from the scar in Soul's chest. Enraged, she demands Soul to tell her what he is playing at. Soul merely replies that he is only releasing the pain that he had been holding back for so long. Gleefully, Soul attacks Stein, who uses Jacqueline as a Weapon partner. However, Soul's blade is sharp enough to wound both Stein and Jacqueline, even in Weapon form. Stein decides to attack Soul before he can attack himself, but Soul
   retaliates
   by using sound waves by turning his blade into a keyboard. The sound waves attempt to drag Stein into insanity, but Kim manages to negate the insanity with her Regeneration Magic.

   Stein marvels at how Soul is able to create such powerful sound waves by himself, and states that Maka's Soul Perception ability must have grown stronger as well through using Soul Resonance with Soul. Maka grins and states that although Stein only seems to have noticed now, she and Soul had always become stronger together. She adds, 'Right, Soul?' but Soul ignores her and keeps on attacking. Stein asks Maka what is going on with Soul, and Maka states that Soul has not completely given into the madness and is fighting within himself. She states that he will come back. Just as she says, Soul manages to quell the insanity within himself and returns to normal. Maka, however, annoyed that he is still acting cool even though he is not under the influence of the Black Blood anymore, gives him a Maka Chop with her hand. As Soul protests, Maka begins punching and kicking him, saying that it is payback for pulling her hair. Stein, relieved, raises the threat level of the Black Blood spheres and tells the Russian Branch to take cover.

Maka uses her resonance with Soul to grow wings and join Black☆Star in the sky where they search for the whale. As they begin the hunt, Maka feels that something is wrong with the sky. They hear a loud noise and the sky whale appears before them and they pursue it. Black☆Star suggests forcing it to go down, but Maka reminds him they cannot directly interfere in the hunt. When the sky whale spouts Maka and Black☆Star can sense there is madness in his spout, and Maka realizes that there is a higher concentration of madness at high altitudes and wonders why it is like this. As they continue to chase the sky whale Soul realizes that the sky whale is sensitive to sound and suggests using the noise in the sky to their advantage to corner the whale. Maka and Soul proceed to attack the sky whale with supersonic waves of sound, causing it to gradually descend to lower altitudes. Heming spots the whale and shoots it down, ending the assignment with success. As they head back to the DWMA, Maka reflects on the uneasy feeling she had back in the sky, saying it was similar to the Kishin. As they arrive back at the DWMA, they are met by Marie who tells them that Crona has been added to Shinigami's list and that Spartoi has been ordered to execute them.
Maka was upset about Shinigami's order of the execution of Crona. However, she understands what must be done. Kid said to her that it is not about executing Crona, rather than maintaining "order". While Maka was trying to find Crona, she came across Asura's wavelength. She and Soul went straight to Shinigami to report, but he already had found out his whereabouts. With that task at hand, Kid was in charge of investigating the matter (partly because of his skateboard capability), but had to quit Spartoi to do so because of his status as a shinigami.

He said that Liz and Patti are making an will, and that he was sorry about putting her in a tough situation with Crona's research and all. She said it was fine since they stopped for today.

   Spirit gives Maka her mother's wedding ring, rather than the will that she was expecting. Maka's mother sent it back to him after the divorce. It is revealed that he was young and broke, so he went to buy a cheap ring off the street from an old lady. According to the old lady, there is an charm written on the back side of it that could apparently purify madness and misfortune. It was brought to Maka for all the hard work she is doing for them and because she was born to them. Spirit claims that her mother is strong enough to not fall prey to madness and that she probably knew that the world is surrounded with madness right now. She probably wants Maka to have it. Maka thanks him and puts it on. He then mentions that, when her mother was pregnant with her, he wanted a boy. Upon her confusion, he says that he thought that a girl like her father would have inexhaustible source of worries. Initially, this statement annoyed Maka. However, her father went on to say that he was glad that it was her. He hugged her and said that she had grown strong. Spirit went on to say while he was a bad father; Crona was a poor child that was raised by Medusa. He and Stein should have stopped the witch back when they first met at the Santa-Marianovera's church. At this point Maka then remembers something that she had missed in her search for Crona. She hurries away, leaving Spirit relatively confused. Spirit then states that Maka reminds him of her mother's straight-forwardness.

   Maka and the other arrived in Italy. She continued to search Crona and eventually pinpointed their location. However, she want to make sure of a few things before proceed the mission. In her perspective, she is not sure she can fight Crona. When she went into Santa-Marianovera's church, Crona asked who she is. At first Maka thought Crona lost their memories again; however Crona said that they are just trying to straighten their memories and that she caught them in the moment. Maka said she came here to stop Crona from pursuing Asura and to persude them to come back to their friends. However, Crona refused because they just killed their mother, Medusa, and is afraid that they will do the same to her and the others. When Crona escaped to go to the Moon, she made a vow to bring Crona back, even if she has to break the "order" to do so. Then after Kilik's group leave, Maka, Soul, Black☆Star and Tsubaki decide helping Crona is more important than following the order of Spartoi. They abandon their duties as members of Spartoi and change back to their old clothes to show they were no longer a part of it, and head off to the moon.
Maka with Soul and Black☆Star with Tsubaki were going to the Moon with Maka using her Grigori soul to fly there while Black☆Star used Tsubaki's shadow to stretch him up to the moon.
