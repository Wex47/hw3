   Stein is loosely based upon the two central characters from the 1818 novel by Mary Shelley,
   <i key="ef9e3e6a-1889-4300-a24a-ed256637fe99">
    Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus
   </i>
   and its
   1931 movie adaption
   , being an amalgamation of the mad scientist Victor Frankenstein and his nameless man-made monster. Like Victor Frankenstein, Stein has a mindset in which he wishes to live in a world "without God," setting his own rules rather than following those of some higher power. In addition, Stein also has motifs centered around electricity, similar to that used by Victor Frankenstein in the 1931 movie to give life to the creature. Both his attacks evoke electricity and his current partner has attacks centered around electricity. The screw in Stein's head resembles the bolts found in the head or neck in many popular portrayals of Frankenstein's monster that all follow the 1931 movie's lead. Stein has more moves than just electricity; he can also use his soul as a shield, as shown when Stein battled

   . When he battled Medusa, he also uses an attack straight to Medusa's stomach, causing her to nearly die.

    Personality
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="a203ab48-c39d-4de4-b667-75182327f464">
   Being a man of science, Dr. Stein sees everything in the world, including himself, as an experiment. From childhood, he often wanted to dissect the people around him only to be stopped by Spirit.
   This personality trait made all those around him afraid of him. This strange hobby of wanting to dissect anything he thinks is interesting was still present, even when Stein became an adult; once, as part of a lesson, he tried to have his class dissect an endangered animal, claiming that it would be bad if he did not find out anything from it before it became extinct. The stitching across his face suggests that he had worked on himself at one point.
  </p>
  <p key="c362dcfa-af91-40c3-b5df-1f9bfb8fc925">
   He also exhibits a sadistic and intimidating personality. During his battle against Maka and Black☆Star, he grabbed Maka by one of her pigtails, lifted her shirt up and drew marks on her body, to signify where he would put the knife through, and ponders if he should turn her skin into sand paper. When Black☆Star tried to attack him, he countered by knocking him out in a seemingly painful and bloody manner. His smiles are normally filled with sadistic intentions.
  </p>
  <p key="d2bb2bfc-d5d0-45b3-bcb0-c0313c819265">
   Stein seems to have dormant madness. He has even admitted that he is especially sensitive to it. Stein ultimately did go insane and struggled to maintain it. He even quit smoking as a way to convince himself.
  </p>
  <p key="7e86be55-4865-476f-8941-f2d9a292e24e">
   Emotionally,
   Naigus
   has described him as always alone and that he has no love in him. He has admitted that he can't understand Spirit's reaction to Maka asking him to go out shopping. This shows he can't feel deep emotions other than the need to dissect whatever interests or irritates him. This tendency likely seems to be more destructive or psychotic, which explains his dormant madness. He is depicted as morally bankrupt, at least back in his youth. In Sid's flashback, he questioned Sid's decision to adopt Black☆Star, who was a baby. This suggests that if it were Stein's decision, he would have left Black☆Star. His immorality is supported further by his repeated experiments on Spirit back when they were younger. Furthermore, it was these destructive habits that would lead Spirit to leave Stein for Maka's mother (who actually informed him that he was being experimented on in the first place.)
  </p>
  <p key="519ac96a-6ac0-492b-82c6-e424167d0807">
   Despite this cruel and twisted personality, Stein does have a kind and compassionate side that worries for his friends and students and he feels the need to protect them. He also exhibits a rather paternal demeanor towards his students. He also expresses deep disgust and moral outrage towards
   <a href="Medusa Gorgon.html" key="6223d8ce-0e62-4aef-816d-c802c99d8053" title="Medusa Gorgon">
    Medusa
   </a>
   for stating that she would abandon her own child, Crona, when they would become useless to her. It is never stated when this other personality arose. However, one can assume this may have arose after Spirit left Stein and that perhaps the fallout between them had Stein go on to become a nicer person after losing one of the few people that could put up with him.

    Appearance

  </h2>
  <p key="cc1ccba6-b548-478e-8aca-50f0ebd92fb0">
   Stein appears as a handsome male with silver-gray hair, large and round glasses, and a handsome face. Stein's most notable trait is likely the large screw-in bolt going through his head. He often turns this screw, a means to focus his thoughts or as he prepares to attack an opponent.
  </p>
  <p key="bcef0639-25a9-4cfb-af9b-18f72df27414">
   Another notable detail about Stein's body, as well as his clothes, are their zig-zag stitches. He has sewn stitches all over his body and clothing; even his house is covered in stitches. His most notable piece of clothing is his doctor's lab coat. He is also surprisingly well built for a man his age, due to a large portion of his time being devoted to combat training. He has a turtleneck shirt underneath his coat. It is 2 different gray shade pattern. With the dark one on top and lighter in the middle, with the same dark under the lighter one. The shirt also has stitches in a zig-zags on the lines on the shirt.
  </p>
  <p key="8c2e1698-a77d-4fb9-a733-6a16cd505394">
   As a child, his bolt and glasses are noticeably absent. He is also much shorter and visibly smaller than Spirit.

Stein then grabs Maka and threatens to dissect her, only to be interrupted by Black☆Star, who manages to connect his

   . Unfortunately, it is ineffective, as Stein managed to match his wavelength with Black☆Star, nullifying the attack. He then attacks Black☆Star, releasing a Soul Menace upon Black☆Star, apparently killing him.

   Soul, angered by this, proceeds to attack Stein, only to be stopped by Maka, who is daunted after seeing the size of Stein's soul, and concedes that the difference between their strength is insurmountable. Soul, however, refuses to give up and, through a small pep talk, manages to rekindle Maka's fighting spirit. Together, they conduct a resonance between their wavelengths and perform
   Witch-Hunt
   . Stein is not daunted by this and takes the attack, barehanded. With some sign of actual effort, he manages to break it, knocking Maka away. Before he can put his hands on the fallen Maka, Soul appears and guards her. Stein, impressed, pats Soul on the head and gives him a passing grade for being willing to protect his Meister with his own body. He reveals that this was all a plan orchestrated by Death and, as it turns out, Black☆Star was not killed, but merely knocked unconscious.

Even without this magic, Stein is slowly losing the fight against his madness, and he knows it. Stein is implicated as the murderer of a fellow Shibusen colleague,

   Justin Law

It appears her attack has little effect but after extending part of her weapon from her fist, Justin is sent flying yet he still manages to recover in mid-air to land safely. Observing this ineffective result, Stein questions her on whether or not she was now even, before asking her to assume her weapon form so both her and Stein could go on the offensive. The resulting speed, enhanced by Marie's abilities, easily overwhelms Justin, who couldn't even re-act to their attacks, forcing him to retreat using an artifact. This leaves Marie and Stein in the desert outskirts of Death City, with nothing but the coffin Justin left behind.

   When Stein and Marie eventually return to the Shibusen, both they and Spirit are brought before Death. They all proceed to apologize for their individual transgressions, with Stein focusing upon how his running away was in flagrant defiance of the regulations. Death appears unfazed and simply asks for all of them to say sorry. Stein then reveals that he has uncovered proof of his innocence and of the true culprit. Marie takes out a tape recorder and plays back what was supposed to be their previous conversation with Justin, unfortunately all that was recorded was 5 full minutes of his background music. Stein smiles and light halfheartedly comments upon the situation, before Spirit reveals that he had been conducting his own investigation, proving Justin as B.J.'s murderer. Stein replies by stating the information they had discovered, specifically concerning Justin's acquaintance with someone with magical connections.

He remarked Marie and Spirit that he came to the Moon because he was allowed to "dissect" the enemies. When he was fighting, Spirit is worried and compared him to a Kishin. Stein fights against Justin and continuously dodges every single attack. He then managed to hit him directly with a powerful Soul Menace with Marie's help of channeling a massive amount of Stein's wavelength through her.
