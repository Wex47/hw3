   An assassin with an unusual trait of desiring to be in the spotlight, Black☆Star can be described as a wild meister in contrast to his calmer weapon partner with dreams of "transcending the gods". Eventually, Black☆Star also develops the goal of committing himself to mastering the
   Path of the Warrior
   .

  <p key="033a2ee0-ccbc-40e8-ad62-265f9c49315f">
   Initially, Black☆Star was remarked to be intensely self-centered by Stein

   His main outfit consists of a sleeveless black shirt with a funnel-like collar, with white trousers that are black from the knee down and just a little short of being full length jeans. On the front of his collar, two short strips of grey material adorned with rivets stretch down from the top of the collar to the breast of his shirt. Black☆Star has similar strips wrapped around his neck in the form of a scarf, and around his waist in the form of a belt. Rivets can also be seen on his pockets and on the ends of his trousers. On his hand, he wears gray fingerless gloves with heavy wrist weights and has a band going across the back of each hand, adorned with a star. Black☆Star's footwear are basic black boots with white tips, with a star shape visible on the toe of each boot. On his right shoulder is his star-shaped tattoo, showing his heritage as a member of the Star Clan which is just a shade lighter than his normal skin tone.

  <p key="5bba30cf-ef32-4835-8834-99c647c2f6ce">
   Over a year later, Black☆Star then wears blue pants with the hemline rolled a few inches above his ankles, with white shoes and a white belt that is similar to an obi. His feet are wrapped in bandages up to his ankles and his hands and arms are also wrapped in bandages up to the elbow. As per his previous attire, Black☆Star wears a sleeveless top. In this case, it is a custom, white, muscle shirt. Another new addition is a long white scarf, wrapped around his neck with the majority hanged loosely. He also has a fairly noticeable scar running across his tattoo on his right deltoids, numerous smaller scars scattered across his arms, and a faint scar-line running down his right eye—all of which were caused by Mifune during their last match. The spikes in his hair are a lot messier and not as star-shaped. Black☆Star has also grown in height, almost equaling his partner, Tsubaki.

The Soul Resonance draws Black☆Star's shadow towards the blade, and transmutes the sword into a long black sharp sickle-blade and long black chain, composed completely out of Black☆Star's shadow. The blade on the Chain of Blackness is long enough to be wielded as a sword, due to its original form as a chain scythe, Black☆Star is capable of throwing it towards the opponent in the form of a long-range attack. Since the chain originates from his shadow, Black☆Star can still control the trajectory of the blade, even if its thrown a great distance away. There is always a part the chain that encircles Black☆Star wherever he is, giving him protection from assaults from all sides.

   and that his soul is more powerful than the average human's. His soul alone will count as ninety-nine souls. Realizing that Mifune's soul and Angela's Witch Soul would immediately turn Tsubaki into a Death Scythe, Black☆Star eagerly dashes off to face him, with her following behind, not waiting to listen to the rest of what Shinigami has to say about the Witch.
  </p>
  <p key="a3bc2dd9-6cca-496c-a9e7-54c6ea729b3a">
   Tsubaki however, stops Black☆Star and tells him that in their current state, it would be impossible to defeat Mifune and Angela. They would need to go through this mission properly; angered by her criticism, Black☆Star attempts to prove to her that he can easily follow the Way of Assassination, by sneaking up on Tsubaki whilst she is bathing at a waterfall. He manages to do it at first, but then ends up screaming when he sees her naked body, which causes an angry Tsubaki to throw a shuriken at him.

   As the two make their way to

However, Black☆Star then swears to Tsubaki that he will make her into a Death Scythe, and she smiles and says that she knows he will.
However, as they reach the castle, they see Al Capone's men killed, and they are attacked by Mifune. He asks them if they are after Angela. Black☆Star introduces himself to Mifune and declares a duel with him as he thinks he is quite strong. Mifune gives the two a chance to leave, but Black☆Star orders Tsubaki to change into

Mifune quickly proves to be more than a match for Black☆Star, as the Meister struggles against his swordsmanship. he says so to him, that his Weapon is the only thing protecting him, and that no matter how potent a Weapon is, if its Meister is not competent, it will be useless. He gives one last chance for Black☆Star to leave, saying that he does not like to kill a child.

Tsubaki watches on, horrified, thinking Black☆Star is dead. However, the Meister gets up, and yells at Mifune for hitting him with the back of his blade, saying that only he can do those kind of moves. Mifune instead says he feels sorry for her, as she has to put up with him. He calls Black☆Star a 'small kid.' However, she defends Black☆Star, saying that he can succeed if he tries, despite being a bit of an idiot at times. Black☆Star, now furious at Mifune, accuses him for trying to stand out more than him, and declares that the main role will always be himself. Deciding to take the fight seriously, he successfully follows the Way of Assassination. By covering himself with Tsubaki's Smoke Bomb Mode, he uses Tsubaki's
   Dummy Star
   Mode to distract Mifune, before taking down Mifune with one hit using his
   Certain Kill: Black☆Star Big Wave
   . As Mifune is defeated, Black☆Star states that it obvious he lost to someone as great as him.
He proceeds to interrogate Mifune on the whereabouts of Angela. Mifune refuses to say anything and Black☆Star is about to lose his patience when Angela herself arrives and begs the two to spare Mifune. Black☆Star is startled as Angela is only a small child, and that Mifune is defending her until she can fend for herself. Mifune tells Black☆Star that he can take his soul, but he would fight to the death for Angela. In the end, Black☆Star does not kill the two, repeating Mifune's words as he leaves, that he would not like to kill a child.
Back at the DWMA, Black☆Star gives all of Al Capone and his men’s souls to Shinigami, who asks him why he is not taking them when the going is good. Black☆Star declares that someone as great as him has no need to take credit for someone else's work. He asks for Tsubaki's opinion and she happily agrees.
Later however, Black☆Star is back to his old tricks again, peeping on Tsubaki in the school baths, which earns him a shuriken thrown into his head.

He also says that there is also the person who turned Sid into a zombie to consider. Black☆Star eagerly accepts the mission. Shinigami then adds that if they fail this mission, they will be expelled.
Everyone else is distraught about the threat of being expelled apart from Black☆Star, whom Tsubaki tries to get to take the mission seriously.

Maka and Soul proceed to attack, but Stein manages to disarm Maka and prepares to start dissecting her. However, Black☆Star manages to get him to let go by using his Certain Kill: Black☆Star Big Wave, but he is surprised as the attack does not affect his opponent. Stein explains that as he had seen Black☆Star's soul and Soul Wavelength, he had been able to change his own Wavelength to match Black☆Star's, therefore Resonating with him and making Black☆Star's Wavelength attack useless. He then attacks him with his own Wavelength, which causes him to lose consciousness in a pool of blood.
His friends deem him to be dead, and Soul and Maka, the latter regaining her courage to fight Stein, manage to engage in a successful Witch-Hunt. However, Stein still manages to defeat them. When it appears all is lost, Stein and Sid reveal that all of this is just a part of the extra lesson planned by Shinigami. Soul protests that he had still killed Black☆Star, but the Meister then regains consciousness.
The next day, the four students are in class, when Stein, much to Soul and Maka's shock, appears and tells them that he is now their new teacher. Black☆Star merely makes a grumpy remark that Stein is standing out more than him.

   's enrollment in the DWMA. Black☆Star, being the person that he is, is angered that there is someone who is talked about more than he is. He then proceeds to go outside and wait for Kid to appear, along with Soul. Kid, however, is three hours late, as he had spent the entire morning making certain that everything is perfectly symmetrical before his departure. Black☆Star grows even more impatient at his late appearance.

   When Kid finally does arrive, he immediately begins to admire the supreme symmetry of the school building; however, he is quickly devastated when Black☆Star ruins the symmetry by standing on and breaking ones of the spikes protruding out the main skull structure of the entrance. This greatly angers Kid and he prepares to do battle with Black☆Star, who ends up dragging an unwilling Soul into the fight.
During battle, Kid uses his partners,

When Black☆Star expresses his frustration at Kid's long-range attacks, Kid decides to switch to close-range hand-to-hand combat, proving that he surpasses even Black☆Star in martial arts. The fight soon attracts the attention of the students inside the school; leading to Maka, Tsubaki and Stein having to go outside to watch the fight. Asking Maka to see if Death the Kid is Resonating with Liz and Patty, Maka sees that despite it being difficult to wield two Weapons, the three look up to each other, and thus achieve a perfect balance in Soul Wavelengths. On the other hand, Black☆Star and Soul's efforts to defeat Kid are futile against him
Black☆Star and Soul decide to attempt to actually work together as a Weapon and Meister pairing. However, their Wavelengths do not match at all, and Black☆Star cannot lift Soul in Weapon form. Frustrated, he sends his own Wavelength into Soul, which harms the Demon Weapon. In a 'emotional' moment, Soul decides to break up with Black☆Star as partners, but Black☆Star declares that they are still best friends. The two friends hug, but their moment is interrupted as Kid - not being able to resist - shoots the two in the head.
With new resolve, the two go against Death the Kid again. They almost manage to hit him, with Black☆Star managing to feint a kick and then grab Kid's leg to pin him down, which gives Soul an opportunity to slam into him in Weapon form. However, Kid still manages to dodge, and counter-attack the two. He then proceeds to use

   . Despite the situation looking grim, Black☆Star boasts that nothing will defeat him. Obviously, Kid's Death Cannon finishes both of them off.
Kid, surprisingly, loses consciousness too for seemingly unknown reasons. It is then revealed by Maka that, when Soul attempted to slash at Kid, he cut some of Kid’s bangs, with Kid not noticing his broken symmetry until after the explosion. Soul and Black☆Star both agree that this was their 'win from behind.'
Tsubaki then goes to Black☆Star and asks if he is alright, though, his only concern is if she saw him and how well he did. Black☆Star is later seen when Shinigami comes to take his son home.

Those who had wielded Excalibur had been known as heroes and even kings. Black☆Star, obviously, becomes deeply interested in the Weapon. When a passing Stein states that even he wasn't able to wield it, Black☆Star decides to abandon Library duty and go find Excalibur, along with Death the Kid, who is only interested in the sword's symmetry.

Kid begs Black☆Star to carry him, because he does not want to step in the mud. Eventually, Black☆Star gives in and piggy-backs Kid, deeming him as useless; Kid retorts that whilst Black☆Star can keep him from getting wet, he can use an umbrella to prevent the water dripping on him from below. Black☆Star repeats his statement that Kid is useless. While walking through the cave, they pass by a fairy. They inquire her about Excalibur. She instantly makes a disgusted face after she hears them say the name. Puzzled, the two soon reach the sword’s cavern and are impressed at the sight that meets them. Kid is especially fascinated by the sword's symmetrical beauty. However, Black☆Star, to his shock, manages to lift the sword easily, much to the Meister's joy. However, after putting it back, Kid also easily pulls the sword out, which annoys Black☆Star. However, the sword begins to speak and suddenly turns into his human form.
Kid and Black☆Star are amazed at how ridiculous Excalibur’s 'human' form looks, if human it is. Excalibur quickly begins to ask the boys trivial questions, while at the same time not giving them time to respond. On top of that the arrogant manner in which Excalibur waves his cane around and how he always rambles on continuously about his own legend quickly angers Black☆Star. It is even revealed that the book of Excalibur which they had read had been written by Excalibur himself. Excalibur the gives them a large amount of sheets, delineating the one thousand requirements one must meet to wield him. After giving them the stack of papers, Excalibur finally declares them his Meisters. However, immediately after they hold him, the two put him back into the ground and leave in disgust, saying that it is no wonder that the people who have successfully wielded him have been known as heroes if they had been able to put up with his intolerable personality.

Soul the joins the group and Black☆Star, content that Soul is better, greets him. Kid then notices that some of the other students are laughing at them. Maka then directs them to the classroom, where Excalibur has sent a pair of giant bouquets of roses to them, with the message 'I’ll always be waiting for you.' The two are disgusted.

The pair go to the Village of Needles located in East Asia. Enthusiastic as usual, Black☆Star ends up accusing every single person he meets as Masamune. However, when a young boy called
   Ryōku
   notices Black☆Star's star-shaped tattoo on his shoulder, he realizes that he is a member of the Star Clan and angrily tells him to leave, throwing a coin at him, saying that the Star Clan will do anything for money. As the other villagers notices Black☆Star's heritage, the two are forced to leave and scout for Masamune from the treetops on the outskirts of the village. It starts to rain and Black☆Star begins to envy Maka and her Soul Perception ability, since he is forced to rely on his five senses, which are dulled by the rain.
Black☆Star, noticing that Tsubaki is worried and puzzled over the villagers' reaction, finally decides to explain to her about his history. His family were members of the Star Clan, a group of killers who would do anything for money. The Village of Needles had probably been a victim of their bloodthirsty rampages. When Tsubaki asks what had happened to them now, Black☆Star replies that they were all killed by the DWMA thirteen years ago, and he, who had still been an infant at the time, was taken into the DWMA. Tsubaki asks if he holds any grudges against the DMWA, but Black☆Star says no, in that his father and mother paid for their crimes and that is that. Tsubaki expresses her sadness on how Black☆Star is accused of all the things the Clan did when he had not done anything. However, Black☆Star replies happily that he stood out a lot back in the village.

   Suddenly, they feel the presence of Masamune and return to the village. They see Ryōku again, now possessed by the Uncanny Sword. Tsubaki and Black☆Star prepare to fight. Tusbaki tells him that the Uncanny Sword possesses people and uses them to wield him in Weapon form, before devouring their souls afterwards. If Black☆Star is able to send his Wavelength into the host, Masamune would be forced to let go. Black☆Star soon realizes how dangerous Masamune is as he is able to manipulate his host's shadow as well, turning it into a deadly weapon. Black☆Star ends up getting wounded several times, and Tsubaki accuses herself for using Black☆Star, getting him involved in her own family affairs. Black☆Star replies that as they are partners, Tsubaki can rely on him as much as she wants.
He tries to use
   Speed☆Star
   , but ends up sliding on the wet surface of the ground caused by the rain, causing him to hit his crotch as he slides into a statue. Frustrated, he decides to take the battle into the air, preventing Masamune from using his shadow attacks. He then uses
   Shield☆Star
   to trap Ryōku before using his Certain Kill: Black☆Star Big Wave. Masamune lets go of Ryōku and Tsubaki goes on and ventures inside the Uncanny Sword's soul to do battle with him. In the physical world, she remains unconscious, so Black☆Star waits for her to come back. The rest of the villagers think that Black☆Star has hurt Ryōku, and begin beating him with sticks. However, Black☆Star simply ignores them, and he reminisces on how he had first met Tsubaki. When everyone had ignored his stage performance, Tsubaki had been the only one who had watched him right to the end. He declares now that it is her stage performance now and swears that he will wait until the end. When one of the villagers tries to hit her, he stops him and threatens to kill him.
But soon, he is startled to see that Tsubaki's body is being sucked into the sword. He desperately calls for an encore to bring her back, and the sword eventually transforms back into Tsubaki, who apologizes for keeping him waiting. Black☆Star asks her if she is all right, and she replies that she is. However, sensing her sadness, Black☆Star offers her a hug, causing her to break down into tears and accept his offer. However, the villagers still begin to hit Black☆Star. Losing his temper, he kicks one of the villagers sky-high before running off with Tsubaki, saying that he has no interest for people living in the past and that he always carries on forward.
Back at the DWMA, Black☆Star asks if Tsubaki will still be his partner even after defeating Masamune. Tsubaki replies happily with a yes. Glad, the two are congratulated by Shinigami, Stein, Maka, Soul, Death the Kid, Liz and Patty in the Death Room. Later, Black☆Star declares that Tsubaki has acquired Masamune's Uncanny Sword Mode. He tries wielding it but ends up passing out as the sword is too strong for him to wield.

He deduces that Crona would be also used as a hindrance, and tells Black☆Star to fight Crona as his Wavelength-based attacks will be able to damage her/him, whilst Maka and Kid will go after Free and Eruka.

However, seeing how determined Maka is to avenge Soul, he allows her to fight Crona, assuring her that he will come to help her whenever she is in trouble. He then uses Speed☆Star to get past Crona and goes on ahead.

   He later arrives just in time to get Kid to snap out of one of his depressions caused by the asymmetry of his ruined surroundings, mainly, by crashing into him. Black☆Star notices that Kid is battling Free, and thus proceeds to attack him. However, Kid realizes that Free, despite not attempting to dodge Kid's projectile attacks, is trying to avoid being hit by Black☆Star's physical attacks. Kid stops the fight and to Black☆Star's shock, walks through Free, proving that the Free standing before them is nothing more than a hologram produced through Free's magic. He reprimands Black☆Star, asking him why he had not noticed this, even when he had cut him with Tsubaki in
   Ninja Sword
   mode. Black☆Star laughs and declares that since he is so awesome, he would normally expect his strikes bearing no resistance towards an opponent. Kid then states that Tsubaki would have noticed such a thing, but the Weapon, embarrassed, answers that she too was preoccupied; thinking on how much Black☆Star had grown stronger. Dismayed by the fact that they have lost precious time, the two Meisters and their partners go on after Free and Eruka, who had reached the Kishin.

  <p key="dc5fcdc6-2730-4781-82aa-5728e1a9717e">
   Finally, the two reach them. Death the Kid tries to attack, but Free blocks him, leaving Eruka to go and inject the sealed Kishin with the

Exhausted through extended use of the Uncanny Sword, Black☆Star collapses, but is still happy now that the Kishin's revival is thwarted. However, to his shock, the Kishin begins to awaken. Kid states that in his determination to stop Eruka, Black☆Star had created a gap in his mental defenses for the madness to play an illusion on him. Thus, Black☆Star had actually not destroyed the syringe, only the shrine in front of him.
Everyone watches in horror as Asura revives. Black☆Star orders Tsubaki to use her Uncanny Sword, but she refuses, saying that Black☆Star is in no state to fight any more. Outraged, Black☆Star fights by himself and uses Certain Kill: Black☆Star Big Wave on Asura. Because of the damage he had taken, his own Wavelength starts to harm him. However, he tries to keep on fighting, but Asura, with a mere swipe of the hand, defeats him in one blow. He then defeats Kid in the same way, before escaping to the surface.

   To change the mood after the Kishin's revival, Black☆Star, Soul, Death the Kid, Patty and Tsubaki decide to play basketball. Due to a shortage of one player (Liz) they force Maka into joining the game. Black☆Star even lets her be captain of his team, even though he obviously shows signs that he wants to be the captain. Soul brings up the idea of a bet, for each of the teams' respective captain to follow if they lose. If Kid's team loses, they will put the paintings on Kid's walls in his mansion off by 2 cm; if Maka's team loses, she has to go shopping with her father. Ultimately, Kid's team wins, and Maka has to go shopping with her father, much to the joy of Soul, Black☆Star and Patty.

Ox, Kirikou, and Kim decide to stay behind and take care of the forces opposing them. With that, Maka, Black☆Star, and Kid enter the vortex. The first thing they notice is

   appears. Black☆Star decides not to waste time and attacks Mosquito, ignoring the presence of Eibon. Maka follows suit and, eventually, Kid brings himself to ignore Eibon and attacks Mosquito too. None of their attacks, however, are penetrating the tough hide of Mosquito. Mosquito then uses his immense strength to overpower the kids. Luckily, Soul comes up with the idea of Chain Resonance and augmenting it with his music. The group laugh as they hear he is going to play the piano in his soul. When Soul asks why they are laughing, Maka replies that they had finally got Soul to play the piano for them. Soul plays the piano, giving everyone a rush of power, enabling them to maneuver flawlessly around each other and link their attacks with ease. They are easily able to overcome Mosquito with both their speed and strength. Black☆Star activates the Uncanny Sword, being able to Resonate better with it due to Soul's piano, and performs
   Shadow☆Star: Gathering Cutter
   , deeply wounding Mosquito's arms. Kid then manages to connect a Death Cannon, which destroys both of Mosquito's arms. Before they can finish him off, Soul stops playing, advising them to leave as their time limit for staying in the vortex is almost up. Black☆Star angrily says that he is still going to fight, but he shows signs of fatigue after using the Uncanny Sword. Tsubaki suggests that he leave, and he eventually agrees. Since Mosquito can revert to an even younger form of himself, he can remain in the vortex for longer, and the group have no choice but to retreat without Brew.

   On their way out, they meet up with Kirikou and Ox, who help escort them out of the vortex. Kirikou realizes how exhausted Black☆Star is, and offers him a shoulder to lean on. They leave and watch how the Witch's research facility is destroyed by an explosion, though that, too, is a hologram from years past. When they exit the vortex they are greeted by a distraught Marie, who makes a move to strike them, but instead hugs them all for making it out safe (amusingly, she grabs Black☆Star by the neck, much to his inconvenience), but soon threatens that they will all have a talking with her back at the DWMA.

Kid asks if there had been any lasting effects from being within the vortex of Lost Island for too long. Black☆Star replies that he is fine. Kid states that he finds it unnecessary for them to examine him, as he has a god's body. Upon hearing this, Black☆Star, jealous of his god-like abilities, jumps outside and breaks one of the DWMA's pillars, with the intent of galvanizing Kid into a duel. Kid, enraged at Black☆Star's actions agrees to this, with the intention of punishing Black☆Star for ruining the symmetry of the school. The two duel, with Sid, Nygus, Liz and Patty watching. Black☆Star fights intensively, creating an opening even in Death the Kid's defenses. However, when he tries to use

Kid asks Black☆Star what had happened to him, and asks him if he is still the person who is going to surpass God.

Tsubaki's father asks him if he is prepared to go down the 'Path of a Demon' to achieve his goal. Black☆Star angrily replies that he will seek power, even if it means going down the 'Path of a Demon.' However, he begins to have doubts about this when he finds Tsubaki worried about him.

   One night, Black☆Star is outside looking up at the sky. He thinks of his heritage as the Star Clan. He is approached by Tsubaki, and the two talk. Black☆Star tells her that as a member of the Star Clan, he is always in darkness. However, he describes Tsubaki as the bright stars whilst he is the dark sky. Tsubaki teases him, saying that he is not like himself, and Black☆Star, embarrassed, tells her that he just wants to thank her. He then asks her if she can take him to the Will of Nakatsukasa in the Uncanny Sword. Tsubaki complies, and Black☆Star proceeds to meet with the Will, intent on guiding Tsubaki.

  <p key="90fc1cbc-7006-43e3-a8b5-d36b1ff52d00">
   Black☆Star meets with the Will, determined to show him the power of his soul. The Will instead, shows him what it means to follow the 'Path of a Demon,' by forcing Black☆Star to see the images of the regretful souls of those who had fallen by the Uncanny Sword, including Masamune. The Will remarks that Black☆Star is trembling, and the Meister is in tears. However, he claims that these tears are not his own but of the ones who failed to master the ways of the warrior. He tells the deer that he does not want to lose, and proceeds to say that he will take on the burden of the regret of the ones who had fallen. He tells the Will that the path he walks is not the 'Path of a Demon' but the 'Path of a Warrior' who revives the dead. Convinced of his power, the Will agrees to help him, saying that their souls will go alongside him.
Black☆Star arrives first in front of Sid's troops some distance away from Baba Yaga's Castle. However, he soon goes against orders and crashes through the forest, breaking through all of the castle's security and entering the castle's grounds, making a grand entrance. He is approached by three hundred soldiers of Arachnophobia's samurai division. Black☆Star prepares to attack, but Mifune jumps into the fray and tells everyone that he will fight Black☆Star alone.
Mifune sees that Black☆Star has changed. He replies that his soul is now clear of indecision, and that he will overcome Mifune as he had been standing on the path that he had chosen to follow. The two agree that this is their last battle. With their newly achieved power over their Uncanny Sword, Black☆Star and Tsubaki perform Soul Resonance and activate a new Uncanny Sword form--
   Shadow☆Star: First Form - Chain of Blackness
   . With this new power Black☆Star is able to easily match Mifune's strength. After a while, Mifune performs his

   . He then starts to beat Black☆Star with his moves such as
   Sword Fang
   . Seeing that the Chain of Blackness will not work against Mifune, Black☆Star changes it into a new form,
   Shadow☆Star: Third Form - Severed Shadow
   . This drastically improves Black☆Star's speed and allowed him to give Mifune several blows. However, Mifune is able to find a gap in his defenses, but Black☆Star manages to counter this by making Tsubaki turn into a replica of himself, engaging in
   Shadow☆Star: Fourth Form - Branched Darkness
   and performing
   Planet Destruction Cannon
   . The two still continue fighting, with Black☆Star using Severed Shadow again. However, Mifune manages to wound him using his
   Disorderly Line
   . Mifune asks Black☆Star why he is hesitating, and that he himself has now nothing to lose. Black☆Star retorts that he has no hesitation, and he engages in his most powerful form,
   Shadow☆Star: Zeroth Form - Masamune
   . He tells Mifune that he is ready to die following the 'Path of a Warrior.' Mifune asks him if he is ready to take on another responsibility as well. If he does not have anything to lose, he will not be able to defeat him. The two continue fighting, and although Black☆Star manages to wound Mifune, he himself gets grievously injured, with Mifune also breaking two of his fingers after the two lock swords. Mifune tells Black☆Star that he is not the only one who is prepared to die on the 'Path of a Warrior.' He asks if he is going to undermine his name as a warrior by showing indecisiveness to kill him.

  <p key="a54efdde-0520-4d1d-a5a0-80dd036bdb42">
   The Will of Nakatsukasa explains to Black☆Star that following the 'Path of a Warrior' means bearing misfortune and sadness onto others as well. Black☆Star replies by having Tsubaki make the Uncanny Sword the weight of a normal katana. He thanks her and proceeds for the last move.

   Mifune abandons all of his swords, save one, and the two clash, wounding each other with many strikes. During the last moments of the battle, Mifune makes a large cut through Black☆Star's right shoulder and arm, splitting Black☆Star's tattoo in half with a large scar. Black☆Star, unfazed by this, uses the opportunity to stab Mifune on his left side—most likely through his heart.
The last attack by Black☆Star is enough to conclude the battle and ultimately end Mifune's life. As he proceeds to collapse, Mifune catches him and gently lays him down, congratulating him. With the help of Tsubaki, Mifune proceeds to walk towards the castle, apologizing to Angela. Black☆Star watches as Mifune's soul is scattered into the wind.

When Soul plays the Meditation of Souls on his piano to dispel the madness, Black☆Star laughs and calls it a stupid tune.

He states that he is fine, but the students make a note of his remaining scars, and in particular the one intersecting the star tattoo on his shoulder. Kim states that she had attempted to use her magic to heal it but with little effect. Black☆Star unrepentantly states that little magic tricks cannot make this vanish. When Kim, outraged, starts arguing back, Black☆Star then replies that, 'I promised that man I would become a Warrior God...this isn't a mark I can go losing that easily.' His speech impresses everyone, especially the girls. Angela, who had recently joined the DWMA, asks him if he is going to fight. He confidently replies that he will show her how strong he is.

Patty uses the opportunity to kick Black☆Star in between the legs, defeating him. Black☆Star states that it is not fair, but Nygus tells him that it had been him who had turned his back. Angela calls Black☆Star useless, as everyone states that Black☆Star still has not changed. Contradictory to his last statement, Black☆Star asks Kim to use her magic to heal his 'wound' much to the Witch's annoyance. After a while,

She proposes to cover their escape by throwing numerous Tadpole Bombs. Black☆Star, of course, is not pleased and, once the smoke clears, sneaks up on Eruka and threatens to kill her. She fears for her life and attempts to escape, transforming into a frog. She does not travel far, though, before Black☆Star captures her. He wonders aloud if fried frog tastes like chicken, which causes Eruka to beg for mercy.

The Table of Contents explains that Death the Kid is in the seventh Chapter of the book, and to reach him, they would have to traverse through all seven Chapters in the book, with each one having its own dangers. Black☆Star, along with the others, expresses his determination to save Kid, and informs The Table of Contents that they will not be turning back.

Black☆Star is transformed into a girl, who is well-endowed, which he does not hesitate to declare. He also adopts a more feminine personality. As

   As the team continue on to the next Chapter, Gluttony, everyone realizes that even though they had left the Lust Chapter, they are still in their opposite genders, although their personalities have returned to normal. The Table of Contents explains that they will change back to their original form after leaving the Lust Chapter, and that the speed of the transformation depends on the individual's sexual desire: the stronger the desire, the slower the transformation. Black☆Star and Patty, allured by all the food, begin to help themselves to the platters of food laid out in the Chapter, the team are confronted by a monstrous pig that is about to eat them. The team prepare to fight. Black☆Star comments that Tsubaki's Weapon form feels "Less elegant" in male form. After the pig states that its own flesh is of exceptional quality, Black☆Star, along with Kirikou and Patty, decide to eat the pig instead. Black☆Star slices off one of the pig's arms, and Kirikou fries it with Pot of Thunder, before taking a bite out of the roast meat. Black☆Star slices up the rest of the pig, and Kirikou fries the pieces again. He gorges on the meat alongside Kirikou and Patty. Before they can get drawn further into the sin of Gluttony, Soul has The Table of Contents move onto the next Chapter.

Suffused with the color red, and wrought with lava, the area influences them and places them in an enraged and easily irritable mood. The chapter ends up aggravating everyone, making them all fly into a rage. Since Tsubaki is still in her male form whilst everyone from her and Liz have changed back, Black☆Star furiously calls her a pervert for no reason. However, everyone manages to calm down a little. Black☆Star takes a deep breath and wonders where Maka and Soul went. Everyone's anger (especially Black☆Star's) is further put to the test when

Although Black☆Star, along with the others, laugh at the Weapon for being captured, they are soon annoyed by Excalibur, and are further aggravated when Excalibur prevents The Table of Contents from continuing to the next Chapter. Black☆Star and the others manage to distract Excalibur long enough for the team to move to the fifth Chapter, Pride. However, to everyone's despair, Excalibur follows them. Excalibur offers the team a chance to save Kid quicker by using him as a Weapon. Liz decides to wield him and manages to open a crack into space with Excalibur. Black☆Star watches on with the others. However, Liz's pride gets in the way, and she ends up throwing Excalibur out the Book of Eibon. Liz laments over her mistake, as Black☆Star and the others stare on, not really concerned about the mistake.

   Black☆Star is later seen with the others in the seventh Chapter, Greed. He watches Liz transform back into her female form just a little quicker than Tsubaki, and teases Tsubaki along with Kirikou and Patty because of this. Black☆Star casually states that it might be best to not sleep in the same room as Tsubaki anymore, and Kirikou becomes envious as Black☆Star is sharing a room with a girl.

   After reaching the end of Greed, everyone asks The Table of Contents to take them to where Kid is. The Table of Contents answers that he can only take them this far. The rest is up to them. He asks them what they are searching for and Black☆Star responds with 'Power- to fight my enemies, to protect my friends, and to save Kid.' A portal is then opened for him and only him to go. Everyone senses madness coming from the portal. Everyone worries for Black☆Star; he reassures them that he will bring Kid back, before jumping into the portal. After falling for a while, he meets Kid. Initially happy, he sees the look on Kid's face and realizes he must fight him like he fought Crona.

   The two start to descend underwater, although they can still breathe. Black☆Star comments that Kid does not look like he is breathing in the first place. However, Kid, under the influence of madness and determined to create a world of 'nothingness' that surpasses symmetry, instead states that Black☆Star is too big for the world he is making, and thus tells him that he needs to disappear. Black☆Star, to his surprise, tells him that he is relieved, reminding Kid how everyone used to ignore him when he declared to everyone that he would surpass God, except Kid himself, the God in question. He said it made him want to surpass God more than ever. Kid however, then expresses that Black☆Star's declaration is now nothing more than a nuisance. Black☆Star replies that he will still surpass God, and that he is the most powerful. Disgusted, Kid attacks. Black☆Star finds it hard to fight in the water, and instead uses Soul Menace. However, he reminds himself that he is there to bring Kid back, not fight him. However,

He then replies that he does not care what power is, he just does not want to lose. He concludes that power is power, and states that even if his opponent is a God, he will beat him. The two argue on, with Kid saying that Black☆Star's idea of power is simple, and Black☆Star likewise to Kid. Kid attacks him with
   Death God Martial Art - Stance of "Mad Crime"
   . Angered when Kid says that he will feel nothing for anything, Black☆Star thinks of Mifune and asks Kid if he intends to not think about his fallen opponents, and will even erase Liz and Patty. He says that this is not the ultimate power, and says that it is only the mistake of an ultimate idiot. Kid retorts by asking him what he intends to do with his power, and Black☆Star simply says that he does not know and that he will think of it when he becomes the strongest. Black☆Star says that Kid is now just a regular god, and not a God of Death. He tells Kid that he can still act as a regular human being as well as a god, which is the thing that is most amazing about him. He reminds him how Kid did not kill him when he asked him to in their last duel, and only beat him up and let him live. He accuses Kid for turning his back on his ideas of symmetry, turning to nothingness because he cannot be bothered about it anymore. He reminds Kid that Shinigami told him that being a Shinigami is to govern life and death. He says that there is nothing ultimate about nothingness. Black☆Star then states that he has found out what power he desires. The Black Mass immediately appears to listen to his reply.

Kid thanks Black☆Star, and says that he owes him, but the Meister replies that friends are the same as Meister and Weapon, they support each other no matter what. Black☆Star then declares to the Black Mass that the power he seeks is the power to help Kid create the world of order that he wishes to create. The Black Mass warns them that order created through power will create the seven sins that Black☆Star had experienced in the Book. He warns them that 'justice' will turn into 'evil' when taken too far, and make people fall into madness. He says that was how Asura was created, because of Shinigami and the
