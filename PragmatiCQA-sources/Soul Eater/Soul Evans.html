   Soul's attitude is laid-back and nonchalant at the start of the series, as he tries to mold himself to his expectations of how someone "cool" would act. He is almost the complete opposite of Maka Albarn, being reserved and aloof. He often expresses how he feels about some situations by either claiming that something is "cool" or "not cool", Being a cool guy, he prefers to use the direct or stupid approach, which most of the time fails. According to Dr.

   exam, after which he ends up stripped of all of his clothes except his boxers, and is sent back to his seat to finish his test. However, one thing he has gained from all the years of being 'cool' is that he is possibly one of the most loyal people one could possibly meet. He firmly believes that breaking promises and changing sides 'isn't cool at all'. Deep down, he is always looking out for his friends, and is even willing to sacrifice himself in order to protect his partner, Maka, showing his bravery and dedication. Despite his usual unenthusiastic appearance, he proves to be actually quite determined, and he also helps people get back on their feet when they are at a loss. He is also quick-thinking and cunning, being able to figure out a plan or a strategy rather quickly.

   , however, Soul's personality greatly matures, and his stubborn and headstrong demeanor is replaced by a more cool-headed and serious one. He remains remarkably calm and composed no matter how dire the situation is and has impressively deep insight on various situations and people. He is often seen noticing important points no one else had thought of. This goes hand-in-hand with his acute sense and judgment, which is well-respected by his peers. He begins to show more awareness and understanding towards people, up until the point that he even lectures some of the other characters when they are too stubborn to see some situations clearly. Still, he sometimes thinks it's best to leave people to figure things out on their own. He does not waste his words and is often blunt and sometimes short with people, but what he says is mostly to the point. He is also not as trusting as others, showing immediate hostility to anyone who he considers as suspicious, and his deductions are mostly correct. Once he considers someone as an enemy, he sticks to this opinion until it is proven wrong. Since he is infected by the

   He always tends to think things through before doing certain actions. Although this makes him more aware of things that some people cannot see, it sometimes hinders him as he often ends up doubting and hesitating at crucial moments, thereby making him become very indecisive when a decision has to be made quickly. Little Demon once mocked him, saying that the path he follows is only one that he has come across through process of elimination, thus he has no true conviction of his own, and is always running away. A flashback has shown him being even more indifferent about what he wants to do, but Soul states that things are different now, and that he has a conviction to become stronger for Maka. Her actions sometimes inspire him to follow his own heart, which results in him acting rather like Maka, putting himself in certain situations in a way that may seem reckless, but still courageous, such as when he decides to fight

   and Giriko and cringes at the thought of his brother, Wes, who is a superior musician. He also conflicts frequently with the Little Demon in his soul. He keeps most of these problems to himself, and seems reluctant to share his problems with others, which sometimes makes him appear harsh and almost cold. He is mostly seen frowning or scowling. He is rather pessimistic, and is slightly aloof and detached from others, and he admits that he shares Crona's fear of bonding with people. He seems to dislike being popular, especially for rather shallow reasons, like his status as a Death Scythe, shown by his negative reaction to the many love letters and requests to become his partner that he receives. At the DWMA anniversary party, he is seen outside on the balcony by himself rather than with the others, and does not tell Maka of his Black Blood infection and his dreams of Little Demon, although this is mainly because he does not want to worry her. He still has a kindhearted side, although he shows this side mostly to Maka.

   , Soul is transformed into a girl with the characteristics of what entices him the most in the opposite gender. In this form, he noticeably has disgust towards men who are enticed by vulgar women, strongly resembling Maka's very same view. His personality returns to normal after leaving the first Chapter. He quickly reverts to his true male appearance alongside Maka, which means he does not possess many lustful thoughts (which is ironic because of his constant nosebleeds upon seeing Blair's naked body).

   Having come from a family of musicians, Soul also has a great talent for playing the piano. Maka reveals that when they first met, he performed a dark song for her. Apart from this one act, however, he appears reluctant to play in front of other people because he "doesn't know what he’s capable of." Soul’s brother, Wes, is a famous violinist, but Soul wished to break free from his family’s musical tradition, and upon discovering the blood of a Weapon coursing through his veins, he used it as an excuse to leave his past life. He still retains a deep love for music, however, and seems to show enthusiasm in regards to it. Memories of his past still affect him emotionally, so much so that he prefers to forget them entirely. Nevertheless, having grown up in a rather upper-class household he retains many mannerly skills, such as ballroom dancing. He also appears to have an excellent taste for music, personally enjoying jazz, and has a distinctive eye for architecture; he claims Blair’s pumpkin house to be ‘cool’ and later states that he likes Gothic designs when he sees

Maka wishes to sense Crona's Soul Wavelength — which she can only do by falling into the same madness that Crona is in. Soul is upset at her decision, but after a while, he agrees, saying that Maka is the one who decides. He vows that he will bring her back no matter how deep she goes into the insanity.

   Back in the real world, Soul gives into the Black Blood, and Maka is driven by madness, giving her unprecedented abilities that allow her to fight equally against Crona. As the battle goes on, Soul struggles to hang onto both of their sanities against the madness, and constantly tells Maka to snap out of it and to do what she has to do. After Maka ends up doing rather ridiculous things such as trying to eat Crona's head, the true Maka in her mind looks on, embarrassed. Soul assures her that her current behavior is not that different to what she usually is like. Maka, however, takes advantage of this current state and manages to match her Wavelength with that of Crona's, allowing Maka to find her way within Crona's consciousness. Crona reacts violently, experiencing a rejection reaction between them and Ragnarok. Soul then manages to break free from the madness and then pulls Maka out of it too.

   Maka begins to understand Crona's Wavelength and realizes that they have never actually managed to bond with people. She puts Soul down, much to the Demon Weapon's astonishment and begins walking towards Crona. Soul looks on worriedly as she walks through Crona's

   attacks and embraces them, asking Crona to become her friend. Crona, now free from the madness, starts crying and takes her hand. Soul watches the scene with a smile. He admits his own fear of bonding with people as he thinks of his friends. Soul then leaves the Black Room and Little Ogre.

   However, Soul suggests to Maka that they must be going soon, but Maka is uncomfortable with leaving Crona on their own. They are soon attacked by an angered Ragnarok, and Soul ends up trying to pull the Weapon off of Maka. Crona decides to handle Ragnarok and tells the other two to go on.

   is already on the point of escaping. As the Kishin breaks through the ceiling to emerge above Death City, Maka grabs one of his skin scarves, using Soul to try and slow down the Kishin. However, after emerging above the surface, a piece of falling debris hits Maka, releasing her grip. Soul transforms to his human form, catches Maka and uses his body to break her fall. The two land on a crate of oranges, leaving Soul battered and bruised, but otherwise all right. Maka briefly tries to go after Asura before falling unconscious. Soul states his amazement of Maka's resolve. He then watches the battle between Shinigami and Asura with Maka in his arms. After the event, Soul is seen carrying Maka on his back as he walks through the ruined Death City.

   Soul, seeing Maka cooped up in the apartment worrying about Crona, decides to give her a change of air by dragging her to play basketball with Black☆Star and the others (this scene is only shown in the anime). Due to a shortage of one player (Liz), they force Maka into joining the game. Soul brings up the idea of a bet, for each of the team's respective captain to follow if they lose. If Kid's team lose, they will put the paintings on Kid's walls in his mansion off by an inch; if Maka's team lose, she has to go shopping with her father.
   Ultimately, Kid's team wins, and Maka ends up having to go shopping with her father, much to Soul's amusement.

Immediately, a large amount of spider webs shoot out of the wound onto Maka, paralyzing her. This forces Crona to defend her when the Golem strikes, though Maka is still sent flying, bewildered at the current situation. Soul transforms into his human form to check Maka.

   Maka is with Soul at Deathbucks back at Death City, saying bye to Crona as they head home. While walking, Maka wonders if her friends are all right after the battle for Brew. Soul replies that they should be since they are much tougher than him or Maka. Maka then remembers that she had left her notebook in the classroom. She tells Soul to go home and boil the rice as she heads back. When Maka returns to the apartment, Soul notices how late she is and that she has not got her notebook.

When Crona disappears, he questions Maka on whether she had noticed that Crona had started acting strange, as if they had felt that they did not belong in the DWMA.

   Maka and Soul meet with Kirikou and his partners in the the DWMA as they all choose an extra-curricular mission. Krikou spots Black☆Star's signature on the back of one of the mission cards and wonders if Black☆Star had reserved the mission. Maka shows that she is saddened at how the school seems quieter now that Black☆Star and Tsubaki have taken a leave of absence. Soul and Kirikou pause in thought at this. However, Maka soon picks up a mission that reads on the back, 'Leave this kind of boring mission to Maka' in Black☆Star's writing.

   Maka begins to sense the similarity between the Clown's soul and that of Asura's, how this one is small yet absorbing and sucking in everything. Before she can deduce anymore, the Clown attacks and a large battle ensues. Eventually the Clown's soul begins to affect Maka and she is sucked into its madness and any efforts to save her are blocked as pipes surround the pair. Maka is forced to see visions of the deaths of her friends and family, in an attempt to drag her deeper into the madness. Soul desperately tries to reach her, and manages to do so by using his Soul Wavelength. He appears in Maka's mind, both of them dressed as they are in the Black Room. Soul asks her to sit by a piano and explain to her that the songs he plays are of madness. Maka protests that she likes his music. Soul says that insanity gives people strength, but it is the strength that one acquires when they endure the madness that is truly interesting. Maka replies that this power is courage. Soul suggests that they should let Crona know of this too. Soul then takes her hand and tells her to let him listen to her soul. Maka places her finger on a piano note at random, and plays a G note. Her newfound courage through Soul's Wavelength manages to free her from the Clown's madness. Soul grins and says that a G note is perfect for Maka.

After the operation details are discussed, they proceed with the mission, towards South America in the Amazon River Basin. During the trek, they come across a lake polluted by magic due to Arachne's Demon Tool production. Fire and Thunder begin to cry since their Earth Shaman powers directly transmits nature's grief to them. Medusa suggests that the sound of the Earth would probably sound like the babbling of children, as she cannot imagine it sounding like anything else. Soul retorts with a snide comment, asking Medusa how she can say such kind things after messing up the world by releasing Asura. They are then attacked by a large

   The three are next seen in front of the door leading to Arachne's room. With all the locks destroyed by the others, the throne room opens. Maka uses the opportunity to sense for Crona's Soul Wavelength. She is interrupted, though, when Arachne's magic spider thread spell assaults them. Everyone is seen attached to the strings, looking like puppets. Soul collapses on the floor, unable to get up as a puppet without strings. Little Ogre appears out of his shadow and mocks Soul, telling him that his current state suits the person he really is, and not the 'cool' person he so pretends to be. Soul recalls past moments with his brother, Wes, a violinist, and how he had felt he would never be as good as his brother as a musician. He remembers how he had used his abilities as a Demon Weapon to escape from his inferiority. Little Ogre then reminds him of Soul's positive traits, of being an intelligent individual being able to make difficult judgments at such a young age. But he quickly jeers at him, saying that he decides on his actions only by eliminating every other alternative action as worthless. He asks Soul what he wants to do now, but Soul cannot answer. He forsakes Soul, leaving him helpless and calling him a coward for choosing a path to follow through simple elimination, having no clear decision on a path himself. Soul begins to cry for help. As he does this, an image of Arachne above him begins to pull him upward by threads, comforting him. Soul is elated and believes he has been saved. Maka gives Soul a Maka Chop, 'cutting' the strings and freeing Soul from the illusion. As Maka helps him up, Soul thinks to himself on how he had always been indecisive in the past, but sees that he is different from then, and promises to become stronger, for Maka's sake, as she has always helped him through the darkness. They then enter the room. Maka uses her Soul Perception to locate Arachne. When they find her, though, Arachne is seen on the floor, lifeless.

   Soul asks Maka what she thinks of the situation. She replies that she can feel the madness flowing through the room. Suddenly, the darkness begins to spread and attack the three. The darkness reveals itself to be Arachne, who had abandoned her body to fuse with insanity itself. Medusa tries to contain her using her Vector Arrows, but fails. Medusa and Arachne then begin to communicate, with each insulting the other. The conversation ends with Arachne performing a mental attack that immediately defeats Medusa. After that, Arachne begins to attack Maka. Despite Maka's attempts, all her attacks seem to just flow through Arachne, due to her formless state. Maka and Soul both agree that they should use Majin Hunt.

  <p key="2af5c3fd-5413-4dac-8c22-e834248db2a1">
   Maka soon notices that Arachne is trying to overcome everyone in the vicinity, including Maka's friends, with madness. Soul wonders why the insanity is not affecting him. Little Ogre explains to him in the Black Room that Maka's Anti-Demon Wavelength is protecting him. Maka tells Soul to
   spread her
   Anti-Demon Wavelength throughout the castle to everyone. Soul tries to figure out how to spread her Wavelength through such a distance. However, seeing Arachne's magic webs in the Black Room, Soul hatches an idea. He proposes spreading Maka's Anti-Demon Wavelength with his piano by using the spider webs like a string instrument, spreading the Wavelength using the threads as a medium. Little Ogre comments that he only plays the piano, to which Soul replies, 'Don't you know? My brother's a violinist.' Soul plays a piece called 'Meditation of Souls,' the piece his brother,
   Wes
   had always been playing. Since it starts on a G note, it would be perfect for transmitting her Wavelength. He compels everyone to listen to 'Maka's melody.' This works out to be a success, as everyone is saved from the insanity. They even manage to transmit the Anti-Demon Wavelength to Arachne, attacking her and forcing her to sever the network. With this now done, Maka and Soul perform Soul Resonance — activating Majin Hunt.

   Whilst doing so, Soul ends up accidentally activating his Black Blood, which now forms around Maka in the form of a black dress. Soul assures her that it is nothing major to worry about, and that the dress will act as an armor. They decide to take advantage of it before it wears off and attack Arachne. The dress protects Maka from Witch's attacks. With a powerful move coupled with an armor, Maka is able to reach Arachne and deliver a powerful swipe, killing Witch. Maka's attention is quickly changed to Crona's whereabouts. She then notices Medusa's body, but senses a normal soul instead of a Witch Soul. She then senses Medusa and turns her attention to Arachne's body, which is now possessed by Medusa. Maka is immediately attacked by her. Soul immediately rushes to her aid. Medusa reveals that she had used Crona as an incentive for Maka's cooperation. Medusa then states that Maka's abilities are a threat to her and the world's progress to insanity. Before Medusa can finish Maka, she is attacked by

The last thing they want is to have Angela know that Black☆Star killed Mifune. He calms down and accepts the fact.

Soul uses too much of his power and is devoured by Little Ogre and the Black Blood. To stop himself from being completely consumed, however, he cuts off his soul from his body, which makes him fall into a state of unconsciousness, leaving his soul trapped in a small box inside him. Maka decides to go inside his soul to free him. Little Ogre disguises himself as Soul and tries to tempt Maka into opening the box which contains Soul, telling her that inside the box is his courage, which will help him break through his imprisonment. Soul tries to tell Maka not to open the box, but he cannot be heard from inside the it. However, to his relief, Maka sees through Little Ogre's tricks, but still decides to open the box anyway to save him, much to his distress. She opens the box but manages to save Soul from the Black Blood. After being saved, Soul calls Maka an idiot, but goes on to say that she is a really cool partner. Little Ogre, having lost his power, fears that Soul will erase him, but Soul instead accepts him as a part of himself and swallows him whole, much to Maka's disgust.

   The two wake up and see to their shock that Black☆Star and the others are all defeated, with Asura standing victorious. The two proceed to fight him with Majin Hunt, which proves ineffective. They summon all of their power and activate Kishin Hunt but even that proves to be ineffective against Asura. Maka ends up wide open to Asura's attack, but Soul shields her from it, asking his Meister if she is all right before losing consciousness. However, later on, as Maka starts to frighten Asura with the idea of courage, Soul wakes up to cheer her on.

  <p key="d4cc9952-a22d-4eb2-9b54-698d5e2f0e20">
   After Asura is defeated, and the sky returns to normal, Soul is seen looking up at Maka, and says that she is amazing to have defeated Asura on her own. Death the Kid soon asks Soul if he is all right, and goes on to say that although Maka had saved them this time, another Kishin may arise, as long as negative thoughts remain in this world. However, Maka goes on to tell them that when that happens, they will be there to stop it, and that negative thoughts are not the only things that exist, and says that courage will always be in their souls. Soul smiles at her along with everyone else. He is later seen in the credits back at their flat with Maka, Blair and Crona. He ends up getting a nosebleed because of Blair and subsequently gets punched by Maka. He is then seen playing basketball with the rest of the characters and looking over Death City with Maka, Black☆Star, Kid and their partners.

   After becoming a Death Scythe, Soul begins to understand what exactly this means. He and Maka watch Kim flying on Jacqueline with Marie. Maka suggests that because Soul is a Death Scythe now, he should be able to fly too. Marie objects, telling them that becoming a Death Scythe is not something so simple. She continues, that the advanced Wavelength control that a Death Scythe obtains from a Witch's soul can grant magical abilities. If Maka can use the
   Grigori
   form her soul takes and imply it with Soul's new abilities, they may be able to manifest wings.
  </p>
  <p key="8b7dde24-93d2-4ebf-9e17-ccf12e73a729">
   Maka becomes infatuated by the idea of being an angel. Soul, however, is rather half-hearted, much to her annoyance. Spirit then joins them in their training. In beginning the training, Soul transforms into his Weapon form, which is slightly different now that he is a Death Scythe. They are then told that their souls must be synchronized in order to complete the task. They must both focus on the same image, which is the image of Kim flying. While doing this, the scythe blade on Soul shrinks. Marie explains that form manipulation is basic for a Death Scythe and that they must have decided that a long blade will not be efficient for flight. Soul and Maka concentrate on the image of wings, and sharp blade-like wings appear near the blade of Soul's Weapon form. The two float up into the air, and it appears that they are succeeding, until Spirit eagerly tells Soul to think of Maka as an angel. Slightly unnerved by this demand, Soul ends up thinking of the negative things about Maka, such as her wild temper. Maka then starts spinning upside down in circles until they both fall on top of each other. The two argue about whose fault it is. Maka then rants about how she had wanted angel wings instead of the spiky ones that had appeared. They argue again which leads to Maka wishing to be partnered with Ox, since he calls Kim an angel all the time. Soul does not understand this especially because Ox is a Meister. Later, back in the the DWMA, Maka still dreams of becoming an angel, whilst Soul seems against the idea. They are then later called by Spirit to discuss something.
  </p>
  <p key="c78d4b48-5016-4572-b31e-b9921b7d00d8">
   Soul is seen once again with Maka practicing flying with Kim and Jacqueline. Soul appears to have given into Maka's demand, as he has now small angel wings on his Weapon form. Although Maka is pleased with this, the speed achieved in this form is rather slow, much to Soul's dismay.
  </p>
  <p key="bbbeb9b8-10d8-4633-b900-f4e839cdcd4d">
   Prior to this, Spirit had spoken to the two about the many enemies they have, such as the Witches (more specifically Medusa), the new group Noah has formed, and the Kishin. Spirit warns them that they too aim to take out talented people on their side, meaning Maka is also a target. Maka's advanced Soul Perception and her Anti-Demon Wavelength is the reason for her being targeted, and that it is their trump card against the Kishin. Spirit explains that the DWMA must protect Maka at all costs. Maka accuses her father of only worrying about her ability, and promptly leaves. A desperate Spirit asks Soul to watch over Maka. Soul reluctantly agrees.
  </p>
  <p key="9fe56faf-4f9f-44d4-bb02-239880a6d2b1">
   Back to present time, Soul tells Maka that he believes her father cares more about her safety than her ability. Maka assures him that she knows that. They then continue on talking about the many responsibilities they have still to do, such as saving

  <p key="a04d63ac-7630-4b22-805b-14e8479fb469">
   The three engage in battle, Gopher overwhelming Soul and Maka with his tremendous speed. Not too soon after, Gopher charges up a powerful attack in the center of his chest, aimed at Maka. Soul and Maka manage to dodge the attack with the mountain behind taking the impact. Soul remarks that Gopher is not ordinary and Maka explains that Gopher also has the same
   Grigori
   Soul as she does, but filled with evil magic. Gopher then launches another
   barrage of attacks
   at the two. Soul and Maka attempt to attack but are once again outmatched in speed and they are hit by Gopher's attacks. Gopher mocks Maka for her being so weak, and wonders why Noah is willing to go to such trouble to acquire her. Soul begins to talk about their difference in speed and that it may be helpful if they bring the fight to the ground. Maka recalls Soul's words that they are not yet ready, and fueled with new determination, tells Soul to change their wings. Soul complies with a smirk. The two perform a Soul Resonance, creating stronger wings, and prepare to continue the fight.
  </p>
  <p key="28b977ce-fac6-4a18-81a7-84b869c24a89">
   With the new wings and a newly resolved Maka, Soul is confident in Maka winning the battle. Gopher, now aware of Maka's true power, becomes intensely jealous of how

   </a>
   's attention is always focused on her, and attacks. The new set of wings allow Maka to easily evade Gopher's Bullet Wings to secure both a punch and a Witch-Hunt, enraging Gopher as she wounds him. With the hits connecting, Soul expresses tacit glee and for the first time calls Maka an angel.
  </p>
  <p key="d1438677-a97d-4023-8a2b-4d191b336c33">
   Angered that his body has been damaged, Gopher releases his stomach cannon again, specifically infused with his hatred of Maka. Soul recommends that Maka gains distance between them. His advice is useless though, because the ball of energy has the ability to track down the person to whom Gopher's hatred is directed towards. With this realization, both Maka and Soul agree to use Majin Hunt. In doing so, Maka manages to cut through the blast and, in continuing their attack, manages to cut Gopher, too. The wound is superficial however, which prompts Soul to question Maka's reason for not killing Gopher. Maka replies that Gopher is not on Shinigami's list. Both Soul and Maka watch as Gopher escapes using a page from

Soul asks if it is acceptable for Witches to saunter around the streets. Maka answers by telling him that Marie is with them, so it must be under control. This does not stop their inquisitive minds, for Soul and Maka are seen hiding in a hallway, watching the closed door to the Death Room, to try and figure out what is going on. The two eventually watch Marie storm out of the room in an angry fit. Soul soon wishes to leave, but Maka expresses her desire to stay. They see Black☆Star simply kicks the door down and proceeds. Soul suggests they do the same, but Maka states that it is much cooler to sneak around. Soul soon becomes bored and calls this a waste of time.

   Since he knows his Meister well, Soul is not that surprised when he hears that Maka is the one who had secretly borrowed the manuscript of the Book of Eibon from the Library using Spirit's ID card. He supports Maka, saying that since he is a Death Scythe now, Maka would be allowed to take out Level 4 books anyway. When told about the Salvage mission, he expresses his determination along with Maka in saving Kid. Along with fellow Spartoi members Black☆Star, Tsubaki, Liz, Patti, Kirikou, Pot of Fire and Pot of Thunder and his partner Maka, he enters The Book of Eibon to rescue Kid. Immediately after entering the book, they are greeted by the enigmatic

   Immediately, the members of Spartoi have their genders reversed and take the appearance of what they deem to be most attractive in the opposite gender. Despite his comments early on in the manga that Soul would never be interested in a flat-chested woman like Maka, Soul Eater manga, Introduction 1 his lust-reflected appearance has a remarkably similar figure and face to his Meister. Transformed, Soul appears as a female sporting long hair with a fluffy hairband visible beneath. He wears clothes similar to Maka's Spartoi outfit. Overall, his appearance resembles a rich schoolgirl and he adapts to personality of one, annoying Maka. Soon, the
   Succubus
   appears and immediately, the newly transformed male Maka has a nosebleed. Soul is not too happy with this, and chastises Maka for getting a rise out of vulgar women. Blair soon transforms into her male counterpart, which the Succubus falls madly in love with. Blair uses the opportunity to attack and blow away the Succubus with a Halloween Cannon (hot guy version). After this, Soul tells The Table of Contents to continue to the next Chapter.

   The page is flipped and the gang now find themselves in the second Chapter, Gluttony. They then realize that although their personalities have returned, they are still in their opposite genders. The Table of Contents informs them that upon leaving the first Chapter, they will slowly return to their normal selves with the speed of the transformation depending on their sexual desire: the stronger a person's sexual desire, the slower they turn back. Maka snidely comments that Soul would transform the slowest, to which Soul informs her of the nosebleed she had when seeing the Succubus. The monster in this chapter is quickly dealt with when Black☆Star and Kirikou cut, fry, and subsequently eat it. Soul tells The Table of Contents to move on to the next Chapter before they give in to the sin, starting to drool uncontrollably at the food. Unfortunately, Maka and Soul are separated when they move on to the third Chapter, Envy.

   When Soul finds Maka, she is on floor in the corridor of an illusory the DWMA, nearly about to cry. He asks Maka if anything has happened to her. Maka wipes her tears, smiles as if nothing had happened, and asks if anything had happened to Soul. Soul gives her a half-hearted no, but he recalls his experience regarding Wes, who questions him on his decision to partner with Maka, by asking him if her inability to discern good music with bad is the reason he had become Maka's Weapon. Soul shouts a, 'No.' Back in the present, Soul reassures himself that that had not been reason why he had chosen Maka, and that Maka is different. He reaches for Maka's hand so as to not lose each other again.

  <p key="36e40218-df2d-4296-801f-2706f291e952">
   In their next scene, Maka and Soul are in a room of only chairs and beds, meaning the chapter they are in is the sixth Chapter, Sloth. Maka, looking depressed, sits down on a chair and confides to him her feelings of ineptitude at being his Meister. She decides they should never fight as Weapon and Meister again.
  </p>
  <p key="7c05598b-abb0-4f40-bb83-a985d4d9ef6f">
   Soul is slightly unnerved by this sudden statement, and asks his partner why she is saying this. Maka reassures him that it is not his fault and that she is the one to blame. Soul asks her what reasons she has for wanting to split up, and Maka answers because she is nothing but baggage to Soul, as she is not strong like Death the Kid or Black☆Star. Soul tells her not to talk nonsense just because of an illusion in a book. Maka then tells Soul that he must have seen something in the third chapter as well. Soul hesitates, as he remembers the mocking face of his older brother Wes. The illusory Wes had told Soul that after running away from music, his family and Wes himself, Soul had partnered with Maka because she did not know anything about music. In this way, Soul would have been able to ease the jealousy he had for Wes. The illusion of Wes sneers at him, asking if Soul is relieved now because of this, and mockingly says that he is happy for him.

   Soul replies that he had not seen anything. However, before the conversation can continue, Giriko appears and attacks him, kicking him violently aside as he pins Maka on a bed. Before Giriko can kill her, Soul kicks him in the face, causing him to retreat from Maka. Soul tells his Meister to quickly prepare for battle, and transforms into his Weapon form. However, despite his constant warnings, Maka fails to defend against Giriko due to her being still emotionally distressed from the Envy chapter. Giriko, bored because that Maka is not putting up a fight, tells her that he will make this quick. Soul, realizing that Maka is in danger, turns into his human form, and to Maka's shock, tells her that he will fight Giriko on his own, as he turns his arm into a scythe blade.

   He charges and attacks Giriko, but is blown back by his Saw Foot. Nevertheless, he stands his ground and attacks again and attempts to stab Giriko, who blocks easily and punches him in the face, jumps above him and deals the Death Scythe a cut in his shoulder with his Saw Foot. Giriko continues mocking Soul for his inability to fight on the same level as him, as he kicks Soul, grabs his sleeve, and pushes his chainsaw blades into his chest. Soul screams in pain and is kicked back onto the floor by Giriko, in front of a speechless Maka. However, Soul gets back up. He voices his frustration in not being able to do anything for Maka. However, he tells Giriko that this is not the courage that Maka had shown to him. Giriko starts as he senses the Death Scythe's soul suddenly flare up. Soul stands back up, telling Giriko that it is now his turn to show his own courage.

  <p key="fa4f5422-200c-4bc4-9c84-6bb27aa80e2c">
   Maka, newly resolved, apologizes to Soul but he smiles and tells her that she does not need to say anything. The two then fight as a team, but Giriko is too powerful. Soul then goes into the Black Room to play his piano in order to use his Noise Cancelling ability to cancel Giriko's Soul Wavelength out, combining his powers with Arachne's abilities to spread Wavelengths through spider webs. The plan works, but Giriko comes back as a female, using a new body as backup if anything happened to his old one. He then cancels out Soul's piano, causing it to explode. Soul screams in pain. However, he still tries to defend Maka, kicking back Giriko when he has grabbed Maka's head. The situation grows worse as Maka gains more injuries and loses all control and admits her helplessness, thinking she will die. But, before Giriko can land anymore blows, his soul begins to rupture due to the fact that his soul cannot contain the eight hundred years of rage and anger. Giriko goes into a maniacal fit and charges after Maka, hoping to at least kill her. However, Giriko's soul explodes before he reaches her, leaving him as an empty shell. Soul then carries the injured Maka on his back.

They ask for Maka's help and
   activate their Insanity Wavelength

He complies and they perform a Chain Resonance, with Maka's courage (and likely her anti-magic wavelength as well) acting as a support for Black☆Star and Death the Kids' sanities.

   In the Black Room, Soul confronts Little Ogre, now not so little as he is twice as big as him. Soul tries to stop himself, saying that how he is acting like now is not like him at all. Little Ogre mocks him, asking him, 'then who are you?' He tells him that Soul is afraid of showing his true self, that he is afraid of having his true self judged by others, which is why he suppresses his madness and Black Blood inside him using the idea of 'discipline' as an excuse. Whatever he does, he does in moderation. The only person that told him that he could not be like his brother, Wes, is Soul himself. He is only running away as he does not want to lose face if he cannot compete with Wes, even if he gives it all he has got. Little Ogre goes on to say that Soul even hides his real name as he does not want to harm the Evans name and that he is always trying to figure out how to run away. He compares him to his current state, and says that he is using his true power. Thinking that courage will suppress madness is nonsense. Little Ogre concludes by telling Soul to accept the demon inside him, and become his true potential. He asks Soul again, 'who are you?'

   Soul, however, coolly replies, 'Tch! I get it. So that's what you mean.' He then realizes that Little Ogre actually has not grown bigger, but is only piloting a giant robot version of himself. Disgruntled, Little Ogre blames Soul for everything happening and that it is a result of him facing insanity without fear. Soul replies by telling Little Ogre not to jump to conclusions and says that he has not abandoned his name of Evans because he had wanted to run away, and states that the two things are entirely different. Little Ogre asks him again, 'then who are you?' As the insanity in Soul dies down, he merely replies, 'Soul Eater, Demon Scythe.' Little Ogre mocks him, saying that he should state his name with more gravitas, but Soul replies with a smirk, 'Sorry, I can't do that, but that's who I am.'

Relieved, Stein raises the threat of the Black Blood spheres and orders all of the the DWMA Russian Branch to take cover.

    The relationship between Soul and Maka has been read by fans as having romantic tones. This interpretation owes to actions taken by the duo that are often associated with romantic attraction in fiction: dancing or appearing to be dancing,
    hand holding and bringing their heads towards each other
    and blushing when either party or another brings up their closeness.
    In the Lust chapter of the Book of Eibon, when all characters are genderbent and take on the characteristics of what they find attractive in the opposite gender, fans have pointed out the female Soul's resemblance to Maka. Additional content from sources other than the manga refer to a potential romance between Maka and Soul, as in audio dramas that feature Kim Diehl and Spirit Albarn separately concocting magic that leads Soul to wonder whether he is attracted to Maka and causing Maka, under the effects of a love potion, to desire Soul.
    Despite this interpretation and their closeness, neither the
