   With
   Kim Diehl
   's magic, Fire can enter his Earth Shaman form. In that form, Fire takes on the form of a young boy with chin-length blonde hair with (possibly) red tips. An elaborate marking in the shape of a fireball is emblazoned on one side of his hair, with a similar tattoo on his right shoulder. He has small but profound tear drop-shaped markings beneath each of his eyes and has three short vertical lines marked between his eyes. He also wears a scarf that seems to be made of fire. There are also what appears to be vents located on some parts of his body. Three are seen on each of his pectoral muscles, three on each of his shoulders, and three on the back of each of his hands. He also wears long metal bracelets on each arm.

  </h2>
  <p key="cd7f47d0-d41b-4ab7-9cfd-827438eb44fe">
   Not much is known about the personality of Fire and how it differs from his twin sister, Thunder. Both are inquisitive and easily distracted. More often than not, they do not realize that they are supposed to be serious in some situations, and always remain playful and innocent. They share Kilik's carefree and laid back attitude to most things, and are always cheerful and looking for fun. They are surprisingly tough for their age, and do not show fear when fighting with Kilik. However, they can still be spooked when things get too violent, which causes them to cry and run to Kilik or the nearest person for protection, which show that they are still heavily dependent on others and are defenseless on their own.
  </p>
  <p key="37d39a55-8eb1-49d7-bb63-b0d40ed0ff11">
   Much like normal siblings, they quarrel a lot and can be impatient, no matter how serious the situation is. This is shown during the operation to capture
   Baba Yaga Castle
   against
   Arachnophobia
   . In conducting this mission they nearly ruin Kilik's disguise in front of Mosquito, through arguing while still being an integral part of the disguise. Also, due to their playfulness, they easily fall under the influence of
   Demon Tool Soldier
   Morubi's technique.
  </p>
  <p key="7c60c032-062c-4418-a01b-c89abd154749">
   Despite these setbacks, Fire and Thunder are actually quite serious at times, especially when it comes to their abilities as Earth Shamans. They have deep ties to nature and are shown to express concern, even sadness, when they feel nature's pain from being polluted. Their feelings can be quite intense if nature is heavily affected by something, which may make them emotional in some situations.
  </p>
  <p key="1b227c79-28b2-4cdb-b570-920a85f859cb">
   Due to their young age, they do not speak. Being rather in sync with each other, there are not that many differences in their individual personalities.

They witness the holographic replay of the destruction of the research facility of the island in the magnetic field, before they leave the field.

Although Kilik suggests he change his hairstyle, Ox replies that his hairstyle grants him the power of lightning to protect the ones he loves. Impressed by his spirit, Kilik offers him to go with him on his mission, the mission that requires a burning heart and spirit. Ox agrees and take their mission to the receptionist, who super-approves their mission.

   on her mission to infiltrate Arachne’s castle, which is located in the Amazon River Basin in South America. During their travel in the Amazon forests, the group come across a lake polluted by magic, caused by Arachne's Demon Tool production. Fire and Thunder suddenly begin to loudly weep, to Maka's surprise. Kilik proceeds to explain that 'nature is crying' and that the grief inflicted upon the land due to magical contamination is being directly transmitted to the young children because of their Earth Shaman heritage. As Maka comforts the two, Medusa suggests that the sound of the Earth will probably sound like the babbling of children, as she cannot imagine the Earth's voice as anything else. This causes Soul to throw a snide comment at her, and he asks how Medusa can say such kind things after she had ruined the world by releasing

   , formerly an ordinary creature mutated by the magical pollution. It is covered by a seemingly impervious magical coating, making everyone's attacks useless. Medusa proposes to dissemble this protection using her magic and follow it up with a powerful attack. With that, she enhances Fire and Thunder with Vector Boost, increasing the power of their attacks in order to defeat the creature. Kilik manages to defeat the squid with a combination of Vector Boost and Triple F through Resonating with Fire. Later, the twins look on sadly at the squid's soul as Death the Kid stores it in his body for later. They soon meet up with one of the

   After the group successfully manage to infiltrate the castle, they meet up with

However, everyone's identical appearances forces the two to temporarily split up. Kilik and the twins, with Ox and Harvar, end up playing chess with
   Mosquito

   Soon, everyone is reunited again, and Medusa runs them through with their plan: to destroy the eight Locks scattered throughout the castle that locks the Queen Spider's Room. She uses Vector Conduct on Kilik and Ox to direct them to one of the Locks. Before splitting up, Medusa equips Fire and Thunder with another Vector Boost. However, Ox senses Kim and with persuasion from Kilik, goes on ahead to find her with Harvar. Kilik and the twins go on alone to find the Lock. However, Kilik's cover is nearly blown once again, when the twins start violently arguing between themselves but due to their resemblance to Artifact Soldiers, the deception is preserved. Kilik ends up in a room full of Artifact Soldiers. As he senses the explosions of the other Locks being destroyed, he decides to abandon his disguise and fight his way to the Lock.

   He orders Fire and Thunder to transform. He uses their magically-enhanced powers with Medusa's Vector Boost to easily blow away the forces using attacks such as Double T. When the Artifact Soldiers realize their dwindling numbers, they send in Artifact Soldier Morubi. It uses an ability which involves it creating lots of toys and confetti to appear, which serves to entertain and distract both Fire and Thunder, leaving Kilik to fight alone. The twins completely ignore Kilik being chased around by the Artifact Soldiers, being completely taken in by Morubi's entertaining actions. It is not until Harvar appears and kills Morubi right in front of them that they stop playing. They then run to Kilik, terrified by Harvar. As Kilik and the twins reunite with Ox, Harvar, Jacqueline and Kim, they soon go on to destroy the Lock, opening up the door to the Queen Spider's Room. This is the last time the twins are seen in this arc.

   On their first mission as part of DWMA's elite unit, Spartoi, they are tasked with the locating of certain materials supported by Kilik, Liz and Patti, with Kim and Jacqueline stationed nearby. The operation has lead the group into a seemingly desolate village within Africa, and they are infiltrating one of Medusa's abandoned laboratories in order to gather information of her plans. Through the use of the Demon Tool Income, constant contact is maintained between them and
   Yumi Azusa
   , the Death Scythe in charge of the mission. Yumi advises Kilik to use Fire and Thunder for close-range and the Thompson sisters for long-range combat. As they continue through the town, Fire and Thunder proceed to alert the others to their discovery of an underground passageway, that they are able to detect due to their Earth Shaman powers. The group cautiously descend down the darkened stairs, with the twins assuming their Weapon forms in preparation for any traps.

   After entering the laboratory, they gather the information, and the team exits the hidden structure only to be attacked by numerous crazed locals of the village. Because of them being fired on by guns, Kilik mostly fights using Liz and Patti, whilst Fire and Thunder retain their Weapon form, as Kilik evades the multiple assaults directed towards them, only using the Pots to eventually smash through a solid wall in order to conduct an escape.

Kim passes on her magic to Fire and Thunder, awakening their true Earth Shaman powers, causing them to assume their adult forms. Fire and Thunder take hold of Liz and Patti in Weapon form and fire two huge blasts at the Clown, resulting in the attack,
