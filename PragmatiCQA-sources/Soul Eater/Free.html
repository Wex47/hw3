      Yeah...high and mighty rules...the fates of all wolves in the entire world are controlled by human rules. If any of them threatens a human's way of life, they're killed. Then when there's not many wolves left, they're taken into custody. I don't want a crappy future like that! Now it's my turn to judge. My anger is the anger of nature!!!

   Despite his impressive power and viciousness in combat, Free is actually silly and reasonably comedic in his thoughts and actions. During his escape from
   Witch Prison
   , he explains to

   that while in jail he devised a plan to escape: dig a tunnel under the cell's wall with a spoon. Free came up with this idea out of inspiration from movies he had seen, and he had always thought that the concept was very "cool." This plan, however, is foiled on account of the prison only serving food that required chopsticks, never providing Free with the spoon he so desperately needed. Free is also reasonably foolish and even he acknowledges it, stating that he is is not very good at coming up with ideas. When Eruka suggests that Free could have escaped Witch Prison by urinating on the prison bars so they would corrode and rust over time, Free, upon realization of how simple the concept is, bashes his head against a nearby tree, calling himself an idiot. However, he has shown that he is capable of being cunning. During the attack on DWMA he uses an
   illusory duplicate

   . He also managed to steal one of Maba's eyes, implying he was previously much more skilled than he is currently. This decrease in ability is likely due to his 200-year incarceration.

When he successfully tricks Kid and Black☆Star into thinking that they are actually fighting him during The Eve Party Nightmare while they are actually only fighting an image of him, he is shown laughing at the duo after they discover the truth.

   When he feels as if he is in debt to someone, Free always likes to repay the person to whom he believes he is in debt. Upon first meeting Medusa, Free almost immediately asks her how he can repay her for breaking him out of prison.

   In his human form, he is a tall, attractive man with a muscular build, apparently seeming to be in his thirties, with some facial hair unkept. On his right shoulder he has a tattoo of unknown form, which resembles an eye. HIs left eye is removed and replaced with
   Maba
   's own
   Demon Eye
   . Above this Demon Eye is not an eyebrow but instead a tattoo of the words, without spaces, "NOFUTURE." This eye also shows no pupil or iris, instead it has a magical array.
  </p>
  <p key="496bef0a-a6a9-4f7a-9605-3dd8fa4fbf70">
   Despite his escape from the Witch Prison, Free still almost always wears his prison clothes, complete with a ball and chain on his left leg and black and white striped prisoner pants. Although generally the top half of the outfit is tied around his waist, he also wears a simple white t-shirt instead. Later he is shown with the same shirt, but with an inverted color scheme.

   In his Werewolf form, Free's appearance is that of the typical depiction of a Werewolf. It features mostly dark fur; with his chest area, abdomen, hands, face, and ears all being gray. This form includes a long tail when Free first reveals himself as a Werewolf; however, after it is cut off by Maka's

   Free's soul is large; its diameter is much longer than he is tall. Free's soul changes shape depending on the form he assumes. When assuming his more humanoid form, his soul includes spikes along the top resembling his tufts of hair and decorated with the same array as his Demon Eye and his "NOFUTURE" eyebrow tattoo. When transforming into his Werewolf form, Free's soul expands and gains two spikes at its top, resembling his wolf ears.

   In addition, Free is rusty after having not used his own abilities in over 200 years, which causes him to misplace his own spells, affecting himself instead of his targets. This causes him to lose against Maka and Black☆Star using their respective weapons.
   He later overcomes this weakness.

   and even admits that he exaggerated due to being prideful.
   This may also have been the case since Spatial Magic in particular is distorted against
   Madness
   and Death was imprisoned in his spell. However, Free has also admits himself after a time that his control over Spatial Magic in itself is poor compared to Maba.
   Free even has his own limits; despite his renowned power, he is easily taken out by Mosquito in less then one second just after the latter transforms into his

   His Demon Eye's magical energy is also finite and must be recharged to pull off the Independent Cube spell, which also requires the backing of Calculation Spells in order to pull off.
   The Demon Eye can be inhibited, with Maba ensuring to cover his Demon Eye with blindfold covered with magical symbols and seals to prevent the usage of his powerful Magic within his arsenal.
   His large size has proven to be a problem and makes him incapable of utilizing stealth, as seen when he tries to break Eruka out of DWMA custody only to be caught, with DWMA guards pointing out he is "huge and stands out", further speculating that spotting him would be obvious.

   Two hundred years ago, Free stole the Grand Witch
   Maba
   's eye. When they fought, she discovered that no matter how much effort she put into it, she could not successfully kill him on account of his
   Immortality
   . She, however, used an alternate strategy in defeating Free, and instead of killing him, restrained and had him locked up in
   Witch Prison
   for life. He became famously known among Witches as "Prisoner 13, The Man with the Demon Eye". In order to ensure he never escaped, Maba personally kept the key to his cell in her room.
