   who had run away from the DWMA. He hardly loses his temper, even in the direst of situations. He is also very polite and formal, and his manner of speech is very articulate and polite, even when talking to his friends. He holds pride in his reputation as a top student and holds confidence in his judgment, not hesitating to tell people when they are being irrational. He also likes to refer to himself as 'the Lightning King' (translated as 'the Royal Thunder' in the English dub) or the 'Skilled General Lightning King' (translated as 'Royal Thunder Commander').

   However, despite being logical, Ox does not take his logical thinking as far as his partner, Harvar, who is almost cold-hearted and robotic in his actions because of this. Ox cares for his friends and fellow classmates, and never hesitates to protect them. If his friends are in danger, he does not stall in helping them, even if it means going against the DWMA's orders and injuring his reputation as a top student, showing that he is willing to put aside pride for more important things. He also says that protecting his friends is what it means to be a the DWMA student, and he also trusts his friends and is not afraid of asking them for help. When Harvar stabs Kim in order to protect his Meister, Ox understands the reasoning, but does not agree with it, which shows he has a moral stance in his decisions. This also serves as the main difference between him and Harvar, who is more occupied with the end results, rather than the means. Ox is also shown to be very kindhearted and hard-working. In

   when he hears Kim had taken

   He also displays a fair bit of eccentricity in that he always styles his hair in the shape of two 'horns,' shaving the rest of his hair off. Apparently, he styles his hair every morning, getting up early just for this. He seems to have great pride in his hairstyle, despite being mocked for it, and claims that the two horns (or 'pillars' as he calls them) give him the wisdom to save the ones he loves, and the strength to protect his friends, and is the very lightning that drives him forward. However, he still has the capacity to change, something which he shows to Kim when he snaps his hairstyle in front of her. He is also deeply in love with Kim, and is surprisingly emotional and open about his feelings for her, which is rather out-of-character for his usual serious personality. His love is shown to be a deep one, since he accepts Kim, even though she is a

   Although usually appearing as a studious person, when out of doors in battle, he displays the fierce determination and ferocity of a warrior, and Kilik Rung realizes and even admires his burning heart and determination. He claims that like lightning, his battle prowess is much more stronger outdoors than indoors. Indeed, he seems a lot weaker when fighting inside than with fighting outside. This may imply that he thinks fighting indoors is inappropriate, which is consistent with his politeness.

   Before the time skip, Ox Ford has most of his hair is shaved off, making him completely bald apart from the two bunches of black hair behind his ears which he gels everyday into sharp points. Resembling horns, they're dubbed "Pillars". Ox also wears a white dress shirt with sleeves rolled up, a black tie over a black sweater vest, a belt with black trousers, and black shoes.

   After the time skip and much like all the other members of Spartoi, Ox's attire changes once he joined the elite student group. He still has his thick glasses and still wears a white, dress shirt and a tie. Though, instead of wearing his black vest, he now wears a light-blue blazer in lieu of the aforementioned vest. The blazer has the Spartoi logo on the left breast. He wears a black belt and blue pants. It's likely that he wears white shoes along with his attire. His latest appearances have him wearing a dress shirt with a tie, covered by a sweater. What has changed the most is his hair. He now has a full head of short spiky hair (although he still keeps his horns) which is now a light brown.

   A week later, after Tsugumi, Meme, and Anya get paid for their part-time help, Ox approaches Tsugumi and gives her all the money that Kim had taken from her, which he had earned through work. When Tsugumi is reluctant, he asks her in return not to hate Kim. Although many people are afraid of her, he thinks that her aggressive behavior is intentional in order to avoid others. He tells the girls that they can use the money however they want it, and heads off.

He begins by explaining the importance of them matching their Wavelengths with others around them, aside from their partner. Stein then tells the students to attack him by working together as a team. Harvar transforms into his Weapon form, Soul into his, and Black Star fights without a weapon. When Ox attempts to attack Stein, he instead accidentally attacks Black Star in the rump and subsequently shocks him with Harvar's electric abilities. When Ox tries once more, he again stabs Black Star, who is in the way, and electrifies him. He later ends up doing this again, this time shocking Maka as well, which Black Star is in contact with.

Kilik Rung and Ox volunteer to go after them. Marie tries to stop them, saying that she will fail all of their grades if they go against her orders. Harvar questions whether it is right to go, worrying for Ox's grades.

   Ox and Harvar are called upon by Sid along with Soul, Maka, Kilik Rung and their partners. They hear that they had found Arachnophobia's main headquarters, but are then told that the person who they have to work with is Medusa, who had also blown Kim's cover. Maka, along with a reluctant Soul, agree to take on the mission. Kilik Rung asks what Ox would do, and Ox replies that they are chosen for this because their powers are needed. Since it is an order, he will obey it. Kilik Rung asks him if he is sure in working with the person who had blown Kim and Jacqueline's cover, causing them to run away. Ox then states that he will strike down Medusa the moment she does anything suspicious. He states that he will need Kilik Rung for this mission as well, leading to the Meister's agreement to go on the mission.

   They, along with Kid, Liz and Patty, meet up with Medusa and trek through the Amazon Rainforest to Baba Yaga's Castle. On the way, they meet a
   squid(?)
   , a normal animal that had mutated with the magic polluting the area due to Arachnophobia's Demon Tool manufacturing. Medusa briefly assists Ox by pulling him out of the squid(?)'s attack with

  <p key="a39bed36-fb6d-4442-a78c-73715094e73d">
   Continuing down the tunnel, they meet up with Eruka, who gives them Arachnophobia uniforms to disguise themselves in. The group finally infiltrates the castle. However, because everyone is wearing the exact same uniform (although Ox has his two pillars of hair still prominent in the uniform), they cannot tell who is who and are briefly separated. Ox, Harvar and Kilik Rung end up having to entertain Mosquito with a game of chess. Ox realizes that he is really weak at chess, and wonders if he should just beat him at the game. Kilik Rung is almost found out as Fire and Thunder fight in his uniform, but thankfully, Mosquito only mistakes him for a new Artefact Soldier.

   After a while, all of the students manage to reunite, and Ox and the others all embrace Medusa in joy as they finally find her. Medusa states that she was doing some preparations for the invasion and executes their initial invasion plan. Arachne's room is sealed with eight

  </p>
  <p key="d13dc74b-4cfb-4837-be87-cd531f3239f4">
   Ox and Kilik Rung, with their partners go on towards the Lock, seeing a couple of Arachnophobia members in labcoats, talking on how the Moral Manipulation Machine had become a success. Ox suddenly picks up Kim's Soul Wavelength. Kilik Rung encourages Ox to go after her, saying that he will take care of the Lock. Ox, thankful, does so.
  </p>
  <p key="fa4db815-a228-4f75-abf0-7d678d7c5daf">
   The two enter a strange room full of steam that seems to have the same effect of cannabis. They meet some dazed Arachnophobia soldiers, and later, the two split up to look for Kim. On his own, Ox reflects on how he had always thrown his feelings at Kim without considering her feelings. He calls himself a fool, saying that maybe Kim would not have run away if he had tried to understand her more. Determined to apologize to her, he focuses on her Wavelength and manages to meet with her and Jacqueline.
  </p>
  <p key="687b6fd9-728d-4132-8738-1b37f7aa2e58">
   However, she is seen to be acting strangely, attempting to seduce Ox. Ox pushes him away, saying that a person like her will never do this. However, he pushes Kim too hard and she falls over, and Ox apologizes, pulling her up and asking if she is hurt. However, Kim takes the opportunity to suddenly stab him with a knife, being under the effects of the
   Moral Manipulation Machine
   . She kicks the critically injured Ox, mocking him on being a gentleman, saying that they are boring, and that Arachnophobia is the most popular thing right now. She then proceeds to assault the injured Ox, only too be temporarily stopped by an alarm caused by Black Star invading the castle.
   Jacqueline
   also uses the opportunity to assault Ox but before the situation becomes grim, Harvar enters the scene, only to find Ox, bloody and on the floor, at the hands of Kim. Ox tells him to be careful as Kim and Jacqueline seem to be controlled as something. Harvar, however, refuses to believe him, saying that Kim was tricking them form the start, saying that she is a Witch through and through. Realizing Ox's critical condition, he prepares to attack Kim in order to protect his Meister, despite Ox's protest.
  </p>
  <p key="7f164872-ef35-435b-80cc-e41f56f0fdc9">
   Harvar manages to stab Kim, killing her, much to Ox's sadness. Ox still tries to save her by attempting to use first aid on her wound, but then is startled as Kim's wound is gone. She wakes up and kicks him away, and Ox and Harvar wonder on why she is still alive. They then realize that Kim is a Tanuki Witch, and that she is a master of

   . Ox says that she is indeed an angel, and Kim agrees that she is different from most Witches, which is why she had suffered so much. Using Jacqueline, she blasts fire at them, but Harvar manages to shield Ox from the blast. Harvar tries to kill Kim again before she can use her magic, but Ox tells him that he will fight. Harvar protests at first, but when he finds tat Ox is unmoved, transforms into his Weapon form.
  </p>
  <p key="5d0eb86d-c21f-4c43-a3f7-9296872fe7dc">
   Whilst fighting, Kim explains that Witches born with destructive magic go through what is known as the Sway of Magic as they get older, in which they become destructive in nature as well. But because she had been given with restorative magic and not destructive, she is not under the Sway of Magic, and because of that she could neither be accepted in the Witch community or in the DWMA. She attacks with
   Volantern
   , which Ox cannot dodge due to his injury. Ox explains that the DWMA is willing to accept her, but Kim denies this. She says that she is finally able to feel like she belongs somewhere after joining Arachnophobia and having the Moral Manipulation Machine used on her. Ox questions on why she is crying then. She says that as a Witch, she cannot change, just as Ox cannot change his hairstyle. Ox replies to this by putting down Harvar, and says that people can change, saying that Kim being a Witch does not matter. He snaps his hairstyle in two, promising her that he will make a place where she can belong. After being shown his undying love for her, Kim finally manages to return to normal, and bursts into tears.

   Jacqueline, still under the effects of the Moral Manipulation Machine, tries to attack but is incapacitated by Harvar, who proposes that they return her to normal. Kim, realizing Ox's wound, heals him, and also restores his hair, kissing him on the nose as she does so, leading to them both blushing furiously.
  </p>
  <p key="eac07abd-1704-40f7-9de7-6259377d3291">
   After restoring Jacqueline's morality, they all go and assist Kilik Rung and the three Meister and Weapon teams go on and destroy the Lock.

   Afterwards, Arachne tries to drag down everyone in the vicinity of the castle into
   madness
   , and Ox and his friends (apart from Harvar) are heavily affected by the insanity. However, Maka and Soul manages to save them, with Soul spreading Maka's Anti-Demon Wavelength to everyone.

   Ox is first seen again in the dojo of the DWMA both battered and bruised after losing against a sparring match with Patty. He and Harvar, comment on Patty's athletic ability, comparing it to Maka's. Ox notes that Kim surpasses both in terms of cuteness. This is the first time when he is shown with his new hairstyle. When Black Star appears and emphasizes that he cannot get rid of the scar on his shoulder due to promising to
