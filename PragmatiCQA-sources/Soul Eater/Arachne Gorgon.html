   ". According to legend, the first spider was originally a human woman (named Arachne) from Lydia (within modern-day Turkey) who was such a skilled weaver that she boasted she could weave better than Athena, who is the goddess of crafts among other  things. After a weaving contest that didn't go in Athena's favor, she flew into a rage and turned Arachne into a spider.

  </h2>
  <p key="9458f9da-2606-4c43-ad2f-b212c95b4bf4">
   Carrying herself in an aristocratic and calm manner in most cases, Arachne is a sinister individual who prefers to manipulate others contrary to doing the dirty work herself. She tends to speak in a refined manner.
   Arachne rarely ever shows any negative emotions, looking for any advantage and light of the situation in a pragmatic manner.
   This pragmatic mindset causes her to view not only others but even herself, pointing out to Maka during her fight with the Meister and her partner that her defeat was directly the result of her sacrificing her attacking power by becoming Madness itself, dismissing the notion that courage and spirit had anything to contribute to her imminent death.
   Arachne also seems to like to portray herself as a commanding and motherly figure, with Arachnophobia even regarding her as an "absolute mother figure" to the point of being cult-like
   as well as desiring the power to becoming the "Mother of All Things".
  </p>
  <p key="2989aa6b-5ab2-4a27-8608-c6ca92bb0c1a">
   However, this does not mean even Arachne has noticeable flaws, still able to show even arrogance and pettiness, such as even bickering with her sister
   and would rather play with her individuals and kill them than go in for the kill from the start.
   She also has shown anger towards select individuals, which can hold off for as long as even eight centuries.
   In all, despite her goals, it's even apparent that Arachne cares little for other's actual feelings and free will overall, allowing Crona to be killed at their reaction of rejecting any "love" they might have received from Arachne.
  </p>
  <p key="a8c49977-0b0a-411e-97d1-0a3b4decd4ba">
   Arachne herself prefers high-quality treatment, with having her butler only gather the top of the line vehicles, preferring fancy entrances (such as a red carpet), and drinks the finest of champagne.
   She even makes her own followers serve her champagne with a ladder in her Spider Queen Room despite the danger and how high she tends to sit.

  <p key="0aceef9b-ada6-4db1-ba8a-0ef62166ca13">
   Arachne has an extremely pale and flawless complexion, making it appear like she’s almost constructed entirely out of porcelain. She has a curvy figure, with very large breasts, a thin waist, and wide hips. Her facial features comprise of long dark/black hair, worn in an upwards manner with two long strands that frame either side of her face, and eyes that have both completely grey irises and pupils, each containing a black spider web pattern.
  </p>
  <p key="d1f030ee-c4d1-47c3-814b-744e1e314a57">
   Her typical clothing consists simply of a long black sleeveless dress; however, this dress is incredibly long, in that it completely conceals her feet, while ending in eight small trailing pieces of fabric like the legs of a spider. A narrow black band encircles her neck featuring a small spider emblem that lies at its front and eight extensions that protrude outwards upon the back, with four emerging from either side. Spider web netting branches the gap between the band and the dress, extending downwards from the aforementioned spider emblem. Two large "sleeves", separated entirely from the dress, are worn on her arms, ending just after her elbows. Each of these "sleeves" also display four protrusions, appearing at the ends of the significant amount of overhanging fabric. She also wears two spider earrings that hang downwards from her ears.

She proclaims that it will be hers.
   Pleased to learn Arachnophobia regaining "BREW", Mosquito informs her that the tool is no longer usable. However, rather then disappointed, she decides that as long as DWMA thinks Arachnophobia has "BREW", that they'll have the psychological advantage.
