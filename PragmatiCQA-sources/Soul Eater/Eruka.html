   Befitting her typically passive nature, Eruka remains a woman of rather modest build with long, straight, silvery hair and a narrow mouth, accentuated by a prominent black circle at each end, resembling the air sacs on a frog's mouth. Her usual attire consists of a thigh length black dress with a white polka dot pattern over what appears to be a dark gray blouse, black pants and knee-high white boots. Arguably the most obtrusive characteristic of her appearance is her distinctive orange hat with a frog-like face, which further reflects her amphibian theme. The hat occasionally mimics her facial expressions.

This causes the prisoner to despair as to why he didn't consider something so simple before and inadvertently allows the guards chasing them to catch up. Eruka begins to panic when the guards attack the prisoner, but he survives being skewered and incinerated without so much as a scratch; Eruka realizes that the reason Maba merely locked him away was because he is

Stein engages Medusa in battle and Maka against Crona, allowing Kid and Black☆Star to pursue Eruka and Free. Eruka leaves a cluster of tadpole bombs to slow them down and determine how far they are from catching up, though Kid uses the force of their explosions to increase his own momentum. To hold them back, Eruka gives her Otama Jackson to Free, who uses it as a mount while he

   Eruka assembles the syringe in the attaché case and fills it with Black Blood, finally prepared to inject it into the bag and awaken the Kishin. Kid arrives as Free holds him off to protect Eruka, who is left to fend for herself against Black☆Star as she runs toward the bag. She briefly drops the syringe and has a hallucination of the Kishin slobbering over her head. Otama Jackson tosses the syringe back to Eruka and ends up being beaten up by Black☆Star. Owing her respects to her faithful pet, Eruka sticks the syringe into the bag and desperately tries to inject it. Black☆Star makes one final attack to try and destroy the syringe, only to have a hallucination of his own victory and destroy the statue behind the bag instead. Instead of celebrating her success, Eruka watches with dread as the first Kishin, Asura, awakens and emerges from the bag. The first thing Asura sees upon opening his eyes is Eruka paralyzed with fear, and screams in fright of the equally terrified witch before easily dispatching Black☆Star and Kid and escaping above ground.

   Eruka emerges to the surface with Free to discover that Death has escaped from the Independent Cube, which Eruka notes had dissipated after only forty minutes rather than the hour Free had stated earlier. During the chaos that ensues as Death and Asura battle, Eruka escapes with Free out of Death City and reunites with the Mizune family. To her relief, Eruka notices she can no longer sense Medusa's soul wavelength and realises that she must have died in battle against Stein. Eruka mockingly laments how she was unable to witness her death while also paying her respects to such a powerful witch. She then remarks that she was just kidding.

   Eruka is disguised as an Arachnophobia minion as she tells Arachne that Medusa has arrived at
   Baba Yaga's Castle
   . She shows her in, then shows her out. It is revealed that Medusa wants the fragment of the Book of Eibon that is inside the castle. Eruka is less than happy about being asked to retrieve it. She has a flashback about skipping along and being happy about her freedom from Medusa, before being grabbed by her in Rachel Boyd's body and threatened. Eruka is accompanied by Free and four Mizune sisters, who are being questioned elsewhere. She shows Medusa out after asking about her motives, to which the snake witch replies that she has a few moves of her own to make yet.
