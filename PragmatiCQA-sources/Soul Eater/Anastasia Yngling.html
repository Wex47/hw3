   Coming from a wealthy and dignified background, Anastasia initially came off rather unfriendly and condescending, having feigned disinterest in being a partner to Tsugumi despite having found her to be the epitome of what she sought in "common people". She also showcased herself to be rather blunt and judgemental, being unafraid to call

   "vulgar slobs" and expressing disappointment in Tsugumi's meek personality disallowing her to initially transform.
   Anastasia also doesn't showcase positive emotions towards the various things that actually pleases her, often pretending to be disinterested especially in front of Tsugumi.
   Through her seemingly cold exterior, Anastasia genuinely wishes to learn how to better interact with those whose backgrounds aren't as well off as herself and enjoys more simple opportunities such as being a waitress
   or working as a committee member
   than her duties as a princess.
  </p>
  <p key="9fd1c632-b7f0-4152-8bb1-63a9ea8c0561">
   However, Anastasia has some flaws of her own; of her own admission, Anastasia can come off rather distant to others due to her awkwardness between being formal and casual around friends
   She is also ignorant to the ways of the world due to her sheltered life, making her unable to realize when she is being scammed.
   Her pride can also get the best of her at times, having challenged and fought against Liz and Patty even when presented with a clear disadvantage.
  </p>
  <p key="4ccc21e1-bb4e-4ab3-bd06-060d7e214fca">
   Despite being far more serious than either of her teammates, she possess some quirks and eccentricities herself. She is formal to the point of being unable to drop honorifics without inadvertently insulting another
   She also possess a prodigal nature to the point of seeing $200 as a small amount of money
   and is easily impressed by tasks usually considered mundane or usually done by more common people.
   Tsugumi also once teased Anastasia for being a glutton.

   Anya is a slim fourteen-year-old girl. She has deep blue eyes and long blonde hair going way beyond her shoulders curling up a bit at the end, fitted with a white frilly headband. Her outfit is of a long white blazer with puffed up shoulders, with a blue line going across each sleeve. A single blue line also goes down her blazer from her left shoulder right down to the hem, where it is crossed by another blue line going across. Until Episode 2, she wore
   her family brooch
   , with the family crest in the blue part of the brooch. She also has a white cross stitched on her blazer's collar, and as of Chapter 4 of the manga and Episode 2 of the anime, she begins wearing a DWMA brooch, that of a cross with
   Shinigami
   's mask on it. Beneath her blazer, she wears an extravagant pleated white dress which fans out a little at the knees and white leggings and white Mary Jane-style shoes with small crosses embroidered on them. She also wears cross-shaped earrings.

   Anya is seen inside DWMA in the room where all the newly enrolled students had gathered. Standing on her own, she regrets her decision in coming to Shibusen in her pursuit to learn what 'common' people are like, seeing that Shibusen students are anything but normal.While looking out the window she sees Death the Kid flying around on his skateboard. She is about to give up hope when she sees Tsugumi, and sees to her surprise the ultimate commoner of commoners in Tsugumi. However, due to her shyness, she acts very coldly towards Tsugumi.
  </p>
  <p key="52f58eb5-4013-40c0-8e66-fb3f2adea087">
   However, she does not hesitate in getting herself involved when Tsugumi and Meme end up facing two other enrolled students in a fight. Calling the two enrolled male students 'vulgar,' she immediately accepts to duel them, and orders Tsugumi to transform. When Tsugumi nervously replies that she cannot, Anya, rather annoyed, tells her that she heard that commoners were bright, cheerful, kind and strong people, and that she is sorely disappointed that Tsugumi is not.

   Finally, with encouragement from Sid, Tsugumi manages to transform, and Anya easily beats the two boys. Meme and Tsugumi thank Anya. Meme asks Tsugumi if she wants to be her partner and Tsugumi is on the point of agreeing, but looks to Anya. Anya coldly rejects her, and a dejected Tsugumi turns to agree to be partners with Meme when Anya suddenly grabs her sleeve, a rather desperate and tearful look in her eyes.

   Both Anya and Meme end up being potential Meisters for Tsugumi. Led by Eternal Feather through Death City (Anya secretly admires the city and its 'common' atmosphere), they reach their dormitory. Each of them had been given a weekly student allowance for $200. Anya is rather disappointed that their dormitory looks so grand, expecting a more shabbier building. Eternal Feather then warns the three to watch out for the '

   Inside, they meet Kana Altair, a tarot-card reader. Anya blatantly says that Kana's tarot cards are a sham, causing Kana to insult her back, angering her. After meeting with
   Ms. Misery
   , the three girls reach their dormitory. Anya tries to pick the bed nearest to Tsugumi, and is disappointed when Meme picks it before she can. However, when Meme offers to switch, Anya coolly says that it does not matter, although she is shown to feel rather left out as Meme and Tsugumi chat to each other.
  </p>
  <p key="913018a1-0dd9-4eef-a2cf-c17586fa235e">
   Soon, the three eat out and got to bed. When Anya wakes up, she sees Meme sleeping next to Tsugumi, who is tied to her bed. Wondering what had gone on, Anya says that what they are doing is rather 'disgusting.'

   Tsugumi, after getting her allowance taken from Kim Diehl, returns to her dormitory, only to find that Anya had spent all of her money on getting strange bits and bobs (such as a tanuki statue, dubbed
   Josephine
   by Anya, a shop curtain and a guitar) and that Meme has lost her allowance (Anya says that it is nothing to worry about). Anya offers Tsugumi a taiyaki that she had bought, emphasizing that she was not interested in buying it. The three end up enjoying the taiyaki.

   Putting their leftover money together, the three girls are only able to buy one helping of noodles between them, but Eternal Feather helps them out (Anya struggles in eating the noodles with chopsticks, causing Eternal Feather to give her a fork). The three find out that the Witch of the Girl's Dormitory is none other than

   Because the three have no money, Eternal Feather offers them a place to work part-time: Deathbucks Cafe. Anya, excited at the prospect of working, tries to make it look like she does not want to, but says that she will if Tsugumi really wants to. After arriving at the cafe, the two meet Akane and Clay, who are also working part-time. Anya does not hesitate to mock them for being slack with their money. Changing into the cafe's uniforms, Anya is embarrassed as she thinks the skirt is too short, and her embarrassment causes Meme and Tsugumi to be overwhelmed with how cute she looks.

   Despite her apparent reluctance to work, Anya proves to be the most enthusiastic in working as a waitress, greeting guests with a bright smile and cheerfully taking everyone's orders. After taking a break, the students see Ox delivering coffee beans to the cafe. Anya wonders if Ox spends a lot of his money for Kim, to which Tsugumi tells her to be quiet.

   After finishing their jobs at the cafe, the three girls are stopped by Ox, who gives Tsugumi the money he had earned to pay her back for the money Kim took from her, saying that all he wants in return is for her to not hate Kim. After, Tsugumi is still wondering on what to do with the money, and Anya tells her to spend it all. With encouragement from Meme, Tsugumi decides to hold a party for the three of them, and thank Ox for the money after. She tells Anya and Meme that they do not need to call her with the formal suffix '-san' any more. Although Meme is happy with this, Anya has trouble saying 'Tsugumi' and ends up calling her 'Tsugumin' (with the kanji of 'gumin' meaning 'ignorant person').

Anya decides that it is her turn to be Tsugumi's Meister as Anya was her Meister the previous lesson. But before she can go any further, she is dragged away by Sid to work with another partner, who she gets annoyed with as he hardly responds to what she says. And after seeing Tsugumi and Meme acting friendly with each other, she ends up walking out of the lesson.

   Out in the city, she tries to convince herself that it is inevitable that one person will always be left out in a partnership like hers. She soon grows saddened as she sees that she cannot act as openly and friendly around them. Suddenly, she is approached by a strange Traitor, who proceeds to attack her.

   Although Anya tries to face the Traitor as calmly as she can, determined to show that she is able to fight without Tsugumi, she is cornered in the end, and injured by the strange needle on the Traitor's finger. Cornered, she cries for help, and Meme and Tsugumi finally arrive, much to her joy. Despite Anya's warnings, Meme prepares to fight, until Akane and Clay intervene, causing the Traitor to retreat. Anya, embarrassed and feeling a little humiliated, thanks Akane and Clay and returns to the girl's dormitory with Meme and Tsugumi.

However, as the ink on their arms washes off, Meme soon forgets whose turn it is the next day, much to Anya's annoyance.
