   Harvar has jaw-length, brown hair that is tied up in a spiky ponytail, although initially in the anime his hair lacked the spiky ponytail and instead resembled a bowlcut. He wears a blue shirt with a white collared jacket as a top, coupled with white pants and black shoes. He normally has the collar of his shirt up and closed in his early appearances in the manga; in his later appearances, his top is opened to reveal his undershirt. His most prominent feature is that he wears a red visor, having never been seen without it on, even in Weapon form. This visor also prevents clear view of his eyes; when his eyes are shown, they are brown and almost always seem to be glaring. He also hardly ever smiles.
  </p>
  <p key="73e15980-aa23-46b9-8cc0-994a223083ff">
   As of joining
   Spartoi
   , Harvar has traded his visor for orange-tinted sunglasses which, unlike his visor, now gives a clearer view of his eyes. He also wears his own version of the Spartoi uniform, consisting of a brownish polo shirt, topped by a white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled just above his elbow. He also wears two silver necklaces, with the majority them, alongside his neck, covered by a brown dual-colored, checkered, neckerchief. His attire also consists of a silver bracelet on his right wrist and two earrings — or conch piercings — on each of his ears. He wears the classic Spartoi blue pants and white shoes.

   Harvar is a studious person along with his partner, Ox, and is academic, and also seems to share his partner's expertise over chess. He likes working hard and training, and dislikes resting, saying that it makes him bored. Like his partner, Harvar likes inputting logical thinking in all situations. Similarly, he also has pride in his ability, calling himself 'the Lightning Spear' at one point, similar to how Ox calls himself 'the Lightning King.'
  </p>
  <p key="7fa27c2e-c51f-47f0-9900-7bd3980700b7">
   Unlike Ox though, Harvar is almost coldly logical, always looking at the outcome of certain actions and deducing whether it is worth doing the action or not. This makes him ponder on certain choices, even when his friends are at stake. Despite this, Harvar's cool mind and judgment comes in useful amongst his more hot-tempered team mates such as
   Kilik Rung
   . Even outside battle, he is cool, serious and deadpan.
  </p>
  <p key="c44b0851-c093-405a-bd13-58f2fe405e20">
   He is motivated by a strong sense of duty and loyalty, and when it comes to his obligations as a Weapon and the safety of his partner, Ox, he is shown to be highly serious, composed, and extreme, and is ready to put his life on the line to defend his Meister, no matter the cost. This is evident during the infiltration of the
   Arachnophobia
   's base at
   Baba Yaga's castle
   , when he shields Ox with his own body from Kim's attack. Although always concerned for his safety, Harvar, as a Weapon, still respects his Meister's wishes. He agrees to let Ox fight Kim, despite him being injured.
  </p>
  <p key="bd9da036-73b8-44f8-a5cd-2eff494d8b9e">
   The downside of his loyalty to his Meister is, that if Ox's life is in danger, he is also willing to attack a friend. He would even go so far as to attack
   Kim
   — a former
   DWMA
   student — when she threatens Ox's life, even if she is only brainwashed along with Jacqueline. Here, Harvar is also shown to have a rather inflexible and narrow-minded side, as at first, he denies that they are brainwashed, but that they had been tricking them from the very start. This inflexibility can stem from the common hatred DWMA students have for Witches. Harvar stabs Kim with the full intent of killing her and knocks out
   Jacqueline
   in a rather brutal manner when she attempts to attack Ox. When taking these actions, he shows no remorse or sadness. In battle, he is ruthless and has no mercy, whether his opponent be friend or foe.
  </p>
  <p key="c98d70e8-6cdb-45cf-9a43-421ba3ee3ce5">
   Harvar also has a tendency to be extremely merciless and draconic to the point that he actually intimidates his own teammates. This is seen when he callously impales
   Artifact Soldier Morubi
   in front of
   <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvRmlyZV9hbmRfVGh1bmRlcj9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=" key="f131655f-ff66-4a09-a90d-54c05060b981" title="Fire and Thunder (page does not exist)">
    Fire and Thunder
   </span>
   ; frightening them,
   Kilik Rung
   , Kim and Jacqueline (Ox is a little used to his behavior, but still slightly dismayed). During this same instance, it is shown that he is more focused on completing his mission and eliminating all enemies than on celebrating the fact that they had all managed to regroup with each other after being separated. He seems to be unable almost, to feel or pick up on certain emotions. He does not seem to be bothered by the fact that he can be intimidating to his friends, nor does he seem to notice.
  </p>
  <p key="fe242c69-a8c9-4e3e-9e02-14e82cdcb792">
   Because of his rather emotionless personality, Kilik Rung describes Harvar as 'dry to a fault.' However, his lack of emotions actually proves to be a great defense against
   madness
   . Kilik Rung's choice of words also gives off the impression that Harvar has had this personality for quite some time.
  </p>
  <p key="42d51d8e-5495-4c5f-b496-2acde36943b2">
   Harvar has rarely been seen smiling, with the only noticeable time he does being towards a captured
   Eruka
   who is forced to use her magic to aid DWMA. He tells her the collar around her neck will explode should she make any funny moves. This moment of mean-spiritedness suggests a sadistic side of him towards his enemies.
  </p>
  <p key="c5e4722f-1809-495c-964c-3eb39e0833a5">
   Despite his rather cold and emotionless personality, Harvar does show that he can care for his partner and friends. Looking past his obligations and tough demeanor, it is shown that he genuinely cares for Ox and his well-being. He calls Kim selfish whilst telling her that Ox of all people would never wish to fight her, when she attempts to play at Ox's feelings. Despite his hatred of Witches, when he finds that Kim and Jacqueline are not evil, he later accepts them back in DWMA. He has the capacity to understand the good in people, despite his coldness. He has also shown a lighter, more comedic side to him. He is seen with Ox and Kilik Rung without their shirts on, when Maka and Soul return from their mission — though Harvar just has his top unbuttoned, sans undershirt. During Ox's retelling of how his mission had went, Harvar is shown alongside Kilik Rung, Ox, and both Fire and Thunder in a flashback dancing naked with
   The Wrath Giant
   .
   This is also one of the rarest times Harvar is seen genuinely smiling.

   To combat against Arachne's awakening, Stein starts the class by teaching the students about Chain Resonances. He then calls up Ox and Harvar, Maka and Soul, and Black Star. He begins by explaining the importance of them matching their Soul Wavelengths with others around them, aside from their partner. This team-based Soul Resonance is vital in fighting against
   Arachnophobia
   . Stein then tells the students to attack him as a team. Harvar transforms into his Weapon form,
   Soul
   into his, and
   Black Star
   fights without a weapon. When Ox attempts to attack Stein, he instead accidentally attacks Black Star and subsequently shocks him with Harvar's electric abilities. When Ox tries once more, he again stabs Black Star, who is in the way, and electrifies him, alongside Maka also, who is in contact with Black Star. This angers Black Star, who immediately challenges Ox to a duel. Ox accepts this, and questions Black Star's abilities, believing he could never rival 'The Skilled General Lightning King.' Harvar also expresses his dislike of Black Star, saying that he never really liked him from the start. This only serves to anger Black Star more, who quickly knocks Ox out and sends him flying across the room.

Kilik Rung and Ox volunteer to go after them. Marie tries to stop them, saying that she will fail all of their grades if they go against her orders. Harvar questions whether it is right to go, worrying for Ox's grades.

Ox replies that Kim had declined and told him she'd never be seen with someone with a ridiculous hairstyle as himself. Kilik Rung recommends shaving it off. Ox declines, stating that, even if the woman he loves detests them, he still cannot allow his two towers to be broken, as it is those two towers that gives him the knowledge to save his friends, and the power to protect the ones he loves - the thunder that inspires him. He then goes on that Kim turns away from him, not because his hairstyle is strange, but because they are not polished enough. Harvar is seen nodding in agreement. In the end, Kilik Rung and Ox, along with their partners, agree to go on a mission together to stop the Wrath Giant.

Ox soon senses Kim coming to Shibusen, though, when he greets her, he is completely ignored. Once Kim and Jacqueline land, they are soon surrounded by officials, which leave a confused look on Harvar and Maka. Harvar, along with the other Shibusen students, watches Kim and Jacqueline run away out of fear.

   Whilst fighting, Kim explains that Witches born with destructive magic go through what is known as the Sway of Magic as they get older, in which they become destructive in nature as well. But because she had been given with restorative magic and not destructive, she is not under the Sway of Magic, and because of that she could neither be accepted in the Witch community or in Shibusen. She attacks with
   Wollantern
   , which Ox cannot dodge due to his injury. Harvar tells Ox that he must fight back or he will die. Ox explains that Shibusen is willing to accept her, but Kim denies this. She says that she is finally able to feel like she belongs somewhere after joining Arachnophobia and having the Moral Manipulation Machine used on her. Ox questions on why she is crying then. She says that as a Witch, she cannot change, just as Ox cannot change his hairstyle. Ox replies to this by putting down Harvar, and says that people can change, saying that Kim being a Witch does not matter. He snaps his hairstyle in two, (the effort and strength needed to do such an act widens his wound, much to Harvar's concern) promising her that he will make a place where she can belong. After being shown his undying love for her, Kim finally manages to return to normal, and bursts into tears.

   Jacqueline, still under the effects of the Moral Manipulation Machine, tries to attack but is incapacitated by Harvar, who proposes that they return her to normal. Kim, realizing Ox's wound, heals him, and also restores his hair, kissing him on the nose as she does so, leading to them both blushing furiously. Harvar does not notice this, and wonders why they are both bright red, but does not seem to mind that much.

The three Weapon and Meister teams later go on to destroy the Lock they are designated with.

   Harvar is seen, alongside with a battered and bruised Ox, back in the dojo of Shibusen. After Ox's defeat against Patty, the two comment on
   Patty
   's athletic ability, comparing her's to Maka's. Harvar comments that Patty may even surpass Maka. Ox the says that in cuteness though, Kim is superior. Harvar agrees. He is later seen to be a part of the new Shibusen elite unit Spartoi.

    Much like how Ox Ford is named after the
    University of Oxford
    , Harvar is also named after a school,
    Harvard University
    .
   </li>
   <li key="2c2284be-3b35-4b15-97ab-ec2cbfacea26">
    Harvar's last name, Éclair, is derived from the French word for lightning.
   </li>
   <li key="8da30de5-7e04-412d-9081-f3c437579c43">
    In his first appearance in the manga, Harvar has a bowl haircut. However, in later appearances, he is seen with a spiky ponytail.
   </li>
   <li key="fa196409-16d8-432f-9b5e-938f56d1ee72">
    Before Operation: Capture Baba Yaga's Castle, Harvar always refer to himself with the first-person masculine pronoun,
    <i key="117bae57-5353-4b67-bc95-abf26b0a9315">
     boku
    </i>
    (僕). However, after, he starts referring himself with the more masculine and informal pronoun,
    <i key="e4f46bf0-9b50-4ce4-8e23-9df155f3c60a">
     orē
    </i>
    (俺) which may indicate a slight change in his personality, suggesting that he had become slightly less serious over time.
   </li>
   <li key="bdb58172-0541-41d9-9398-ce5277597c30">
    In
    Chapter 97
    , Harvar complains that he can not draw curves very well. This is revealed in
    Chapter 100
    , when his headband's logo is composed of only straight lines.
