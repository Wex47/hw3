  </h2>
  <p key="0c3e789f-6eff-45e6-8519-3d3d2bc49c80">
   Spirit is casually silly and youthfully influenced in his personal life along with in circumstances that require no seriousness. He's known for his flaw of being a womanizer, finding entertainment in being surrounded by women.
   He is very perverse, being so much he'll even take attendance of only the female students at the
   DWMA
   , an action someone like
   <a href="Soul Evans.html" key="2a46ec7c-c701-48b1-8de4-6e2e7c0abd56" title="Soul Evans">
    Soul Eater
   </a>
   considers creepy.
   He is unable to stay in a long-term relationship due to this flaw. Despite expressing regrets for cheating on his now ex-wife and claiming to love her still, some like Maka find this difficult to believe due to his repeated actions regardless of his apparent guilt.
  </p>
  <p key="67099a50-defa-4ff8-8f7b-6597c2077ed9">
   Perhaps his most redeeming quality, however, is the fact that Spirit is also a truly caring and passionate parent, longing for the love and acceptance of his daughter,
   even prior to cheating on his wife.
   Because of this, he has been shown to continuously support her, even when she denies it.
   In addition, he holds a firm view on the love of a parent, being even so sensitive to it that he was willing to transform out of his weapon form and grab hold of
   <a href="Medusa Gorgon.html" key="84769d46-0df5-445a-a30a-048767c25847" title="Medusa Gorgon">

   </a>
   's collar, despite the danger, to tell her his disgust, though he was reduced to tears and unable to say what he wanted to say in the first place.
   It is therefore evident that, though his attempts to do so are seen as questionable and humiliating by others (such as
   Dr. Stein
   , when Spirit sent his daughter 'positive energy' through ritualistic movements), Spirit actively tries to be a good father to Maka.
  </p>
  <p key="c100d376-b221-4a9a-b392-35c75d58bc49">
   In certain situations, he can be serious. He loves his job and holds his position as a
   Death Scythe
   to a high degree. He feared the loss of it after the resurrection of

   .
   He also has a sense of understanding for the young students in the academy, a trait that even
   Franken Stein
   was unable to completely understand himself.
   He's also compassionate and merciful, supporting
   Sid Barrett
   's decision of sparing

   despite Stein's reluctance.
   He also has showcase wisdom, chastising fellow colleagues
   Alexandre
   and
   Zubaidah
   for wanting to sacrifice their lives, urging them to continue to fight to live until the moment they die
   and was willing to sacrifice his own life for his daughter's sake.

   . Stein then replies that he wishes he was born in a world without a god though when Spirit questioned his seriousness, Stein instead replied he was not, considering such a world "sick".
   During this point in time, he would also have been familiar with
   Azusa Yumi
   , regarding her as a tattletale.
   Unknown to Spirit, he was secretly experiment on by Stein.

   During Maka's younger childhood years, Spirit would often read picture books to Maka (the origin point for her passion for reading) and maintained a close relationship with his daughter.
   However, his relationship became stained with both his wife and daughter after he was caught having extramarital affairs with other women. Eventually, this caused his ex-wife to file for divorce.

Spirit is stabbed emotionally, and begins to sob as Shinigami continues his conversation with Soul and Maka. When they finish and say their goodbyes, Shinigami turns around to Spirit and uses his
   Shinigami Chop
   on him to make him refrain from crying.

   and
   Arisa
   , two, somewhat, strip-teasers/mild men's entertainers. Spirit is seen laughing hysterically with the two in his arms. He laughs until Arisa asks him about his daughter, Maka, to which he freezes and slowly becomes overcome by his emotions as Lisa explains that he is in the process of getting a divorce for constantly cheating on his wife, and how Maka is on her mother's side and she hates him. After Lisa finishes, Spirit bursts into tears and runs out the door of the cabaret club, screaming for forgiveness from Maka and that he loves her and her mother.

During the battle, Soul pretends to want to be with Blair and abandon Maka, to which Spirit rejoices at, only to be Shinigami Chopped by the disapproved Shinigami. Soul then pretends further, and tells Maka that he is not under the influence of Blair's magic like Maka had thought, and that he was simply leaving her because of Blair's body figure, to which Spirit becomes a bit aroused at now that Soul had mentioned it, only to once again be Shinigami Chopped. Maka then begins to lightly shed tears, recounting that she had placed her faith in Soul for not being a "horrible", "cheating", man like (while thinking of her father) all other men are. Spirit is seen with a serious look on his face at this, suggesting his disappointment in himself and realization of Maka's true feelings towards Soul. Soul then reveals that it was a trick against Blair, and Maka comes to the realization and defeats Blair. Soon after, it is revealed that Blair isn't a witch, but a cat with magic powers, and Spirit is lastly seen offering to be her cat toy, only to be Shinigami Chopped one last time.

   Spirit is first seen in the Dispensary at the
   the DWMA
   . He had come to The Academy to see
   Maka
   , but he was unaware that she had gone to Italy with
   Soul
   . He becomes frustrated, because coming to The Academy puts him in a possible run-in with
   Stein
   , who he hasn't seen in years, and is still dreadfully afraid of him. He tries to calm himself by saying he's not afraid, pretending as if he is talking to
   Maka
   , saying that he will confront Stein for her. He then has a contradicting change of pace in thought, and suddenly looks forward to seeing
   Medusa
   , as the school nurse, looking to flirt with her. The Dispensary door then opens, and Spirit immediately embraces the person who opened, thinking that it would be Medusa. Instead, it was Stein, and Spirit jumps into a fetal position under the covers of a bed in the room. Stein teases Spirit at first by telling him that he had swapped the middle toes on his feet, to which he pulls a "made you look" once Spirit desperately checks his feet. Stein then tells Spirit how he noticed how quickly Maka has grown up, and how he thought that Spirit's marriage would last forever, making it sound like he did not know he was divorced. Spirit then tells Stein that he has been divorced for a month in a very grief-filled manner. Stein then reveals that he is aware, and Spirit strangles him. Stein then tells Spirit that the
   Demon Sword
   has popped up, and the two head for Italy.

Stein then breaks down the door, and Spirit then comes in, hoping that Maka would appreciate how "brave and selfless" her father is. But Maka ignores him as usual. The fight then begins between Stein, Spirit, and the Demon Sword. Stein and Spirit make a very good team, and win against Crona, successfully fending off

   's right hand as he begins his opening greeting to the students of the
   the DWMA
   who have come to the foundation anniversary celebration of the academy. After the speech, Spirit pursues
   Maka
   in an urge to dance with her. He finds Maka about to go dance with
   Soul
   , and interrupts, shouting for her to hold on for her to dance with himself. She immediately turns him down and Spirit explodes into a cloud of disappointment. Luckily, Soul did not feel like dancing at the moment, and urges Maka to go bond with her father in an attempt to escape dancing. Maka disappointingly states that she doesn't feel like bonding with Spirit, but Spirit takes advantage of the moment and excitingly shouts that Soul is correct and drags Maka to the dance floor. On the dance floor, Maka is noticeably upset in oddly, sad manner as the two dance, and while Spirit is in his own bright and colorful world due to how happy he is to actually be dancing with his daughter. Spirit then begins to tell Maka that he is thinking about her kindergarten graduation, the last time the two danced, and Maka's attitude switches to her usual annoyance towards Spirit. Recounting the memory, Spirit remembers how Maka was so small that she had to dance on his feet, and then after they finished that he danced with her mother. In an unexpected surprise to Spirit, Maka becomes even further annoyed by the memory, and informs him that he wasn't dancing with her mother on that day, rather, a mother of another girl she knew. Spirit sweats in realization that he had entirely ruined the moment, and is amazed at how far back Maka was able to remember such an incident. He tries to cover up his mistake by completely disregarding what he just said and states that what really matters is the fact that he is dancing with her now, and that the moment will be a great memory. He then tells Maka that he promises to be a better father, but once again, is turned down by a disbelieving Maka.

   In the first tunnel to the Seal Shrine, both Maka and Stein begin to sense a soul right beyond the shadows in front of them. Maka states that she knows the "nasty, despicable" soul, and Spirit emerges from the shadows, hurt by how Maka identified his soul. Stein then asks Spirit how he had escaped from the spatial magic trap, and Spirit states that when chasing a women (referring to the runaway Medusa at the time) no one is faster than he is. Spirit then transforms and is caught by Stein and the two decide to remain partnered for the battle. Medusa soon appears from the shadows as well and Stein quickly explains the plan for stopping the reawakening of the Kishin. Once the entire main cast has passed Medusa, Stein begins his fight with her by hitting her with his soul wavelength. Before the battle extends to any further fighting, Spirit partially transforms to speak with Medusa. He states that he always enjoyed seeing her in her nurse's outfit although he would enjoy more to see her with it "off", especially if he was the one doing it. Stein immediately teases Spirit by stating that he was dancing with her earlier and Spirit becomes jealous. He then takes a turn for the serious, and tells Medusa that a great shame would come upon him as the only
   Death Scythe
   at the DWMA if the Kishin was revived. The fight then commences and Spirit supports Stein when he is engaged with Medusa. However, a great majority of the time, Stein and Medusa simply share conversations about the battle the main cast is having further down the way to the Seal Shrine, watching it using their soul perception.

Spirit immediately shows slight concern for Maka and is taunted by Medusa saying that his daughter had walked into a death trap. Spirit then smiles, and tells Medusa not to underestimate his daughter. Stein then soon asks Medusa why she has seemed to give up on her original intention to create her own Kishin through the demon sword and instead chosen to wake Asura using the same black blood. He also asks where she had abducted the child that had become the demon sword

   . Stein assumes that it was all simply because Medusa had failed and taunts her. She then explains that her work had only pertained to the black blood in general, and informs him that Crona is actually her child. Stein then pursues to ask what exactly she plans to do with Crona if she gets her way and the Kishin is revived. He recounts that her black blood research is finished and she is done with the experiment to which she needed this child, and asks again what comes after. Spirit immediately shows signs of becoming angry as the answer are awaited. Medusa then explains that she will merely abandon Crona, and Spirit becomes furious. As Medusa begins to laugh at their anger towards her Spirit commands her to stop, and becomes so enraged that he comes out of weapon form to walk up and grab Medusa. However, he is short for words, and cannot think of what to say to her, and is flung back to Stein by her vector arrows. Spirit then begins to shed tears to the disgusting thought of parent abandoning her child, but pulls himself together in order to defeat her. As the black blood Resonance battle continues, both Stein and Spirit become very concerned as the black blood begins to activate in both Soul and Maka, however, when the battle has ended, Spirit is calmed by the news that Maka had managed to end the fight peacefully.

   As the underground fight draws to a close, Stein and Spirit try to make an effort to defeat Medusa, but the struggle is drawn out longer by her in order to prevent the two from proceeding aged to the Kishin. Spirit soon asks Stein why he has seemed to lose his edge, and where his ominous "I'll kill you" vibe has gone to. As Stein begins to calm himself, Spirit can easily read that he was regaining this vibe, and remembers that he is in charge of controlling Stein. The battle soon seriously engages again, and eventually comes to Spirit and Stein being in a dead lock with Medusa, restraining her from cutting off Stein's head by blocking her nerve endings through a very complicated soul wavelength attack. They stay in this lock until suddenly, madness begins to overflow, and the Kishin begins to revive. Spirit is mortified as he realizes this, but Stein takes advantage of Medusa's guard drop, and slices her in two. Spirit is amazed that Stein was able to do this, and remains in awe until he Kishin's wavelength fades away and Stein states that he had escaped. Spirit becomes incredibly disappointed in himself, stating that it is all his fault and that if he had stayed with Shinigami like he was suppose to, the Kishin could have been stopped.

   He was at the top floor of the school outside waiting and looking up at the sky. Maka came out. She told him that it's an abuse of authority to call using an public announcer to call her plus it was embarrassing to say. He said that he was sorry and that he wanted to meet her no matter what. She asked if he was going to the mission on the moon as well. He sighed and said yes, but it that only because it was for an important mission plus it's his first foreign trip in a long time run. He said that Liz and Patty are making a will and Maka said, "I see." He said sorry about putting her in a tough situation with Crona's research and all. She said it was fine since they stopped for today. She was thinking to herself that a father and daughter doesn't need to met up in an place like this.....but if it was then she was just a little rude just now. She asked if he needed something from her. He said that he wanted to give her something before going to the moon. She thought it was a will, but to her surprise it was a ring. It turns out to be her mother's wedding ring. She sent it back to him after the divorce. Back then he was young and broke, so he went to buy a cheap ring off the street from an old lady. According to the old lady, there is an charm written on the back side of it that said that it could purifies madness and misfortune. It was brought for Maka from all the hard work she is doing for them and who was born to them. He gave her the ring. Her mother is strong enough to not fall prey to madness so she probably knew that the world is surrounded with madness right now. He explained that Maka's mother probably wants Maka to have it. Maka said thanks. She puts it on. He then mentions that when her mother was pregnant with her that he wanted a boy, Maka then asks why. He thought that a girl who likes her father would have inexhaustible source of worries. She seems to be confused, however he explains that he was glad that it was her and hugs Maka. Spirit then says that she has grown strong and well. He said that Crona was a poor child that was raised by Medusa and that he and Stein shouldn't have stopped them (sex not currently determined officially) back when they first met at the Santa-Marianovera's church. Maka then seemed to become relieved. Maka hurried along her way. He then said that she reminds him of her mother's straight-forwardness.
