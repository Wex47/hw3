   when demonstrating autonomous weapon transformation and flight. Such seriousness was seen by Kim initially as Jacqueline being a "hardnose." Jacqueline is aware that Kim and others may see her as overly serious, although she assures that she is simply focused on upholding responsibilities first before having fun.
  </p>
  <p key="0131d84a-1c4e-4234-bc4e-10ac02e29078">
   When she realizes her interest in partnering with Kim, Jacqueline appears to be a person who is reserved about her feelings and embarrassed when they are recognized by others before she is comfortable expressing them openly.

  <p key="59193534-e158-491e-a85b-aa5ef6ace7c0">
   Despite her awkwardness about her emotion, Jacqueline is caring, serving as a mentor to NOT students, and comes to show herself as compassionate towards her meister Kim. Jacqueline is fully aware that Kim is a

   After having a romantic dream about Kim, Jacqueline tried to get to know her with the help of Tsugumi and other dormitory residents. This met very little success: the meal Jacqueline prepared for Kim was ruined by Meme Tatane forgetting to remove eggshells from the omelette, a bathhouse discussion seemed to insult Kim's hair, and overall Kim rebuffed Jacqueline as to straight-laced to be her friend. But by chance, Jacqueline witnessed Kim performing healing magic on a puppy that was injured from falling debris. After learning Kim's story of leaving the Witch Realm because her regenerative magic did not suit the destructive nature of witches, Jacqueline recognized Kim's kindness and promised not to reveal her secret. After this point, Kim and Jacqueline spent more time together, their shared secret forming the basis for an eventual relationship based on trust in each other.

   Although spending more time with Jacqueline after her status as a witch was uncovered, after Eternal Feather's attack at the Death Bazaar, Kim suggested the two break up. Kim's decision saddened Jacqueline, compounded when Kim nevertheless seemed to alternate between being close and distant to Jacqueline. While Kim claimed she was acting as such so that Jacqueline would not be manipulated by men with bad intentions, Jacqueline claimed Kim was actually the manipulative one. After this point, the two seemed to renew their partnership as meister and weapon.

   During this time, Jacqueline also attempted to learn more about Kim and her status as a witch, such as her age, life expectancy, and animal transformation abilities. While finding Kim's
   tanuki
   form to be adorable, Jacqueline was ordered by Misery, who did not recognize the tanuki as Kim, to remove the animal. Jacqueline used this opportunity to leave Kim, in tanuki form, outside of the dormitory so as to be petted and bothered by other dormitory occupants such as
   Tsugumi Harudori
   and local
   Death City
   residents. When Kim returned late that evening, her hair messed up and her emotions raw from this day-long excursion, Jacqueline realized abandoning Kim made the meister more devoted to the weapon, seeming to improve their partnership.

   After the death of Sid Barett, and after Anya Hepburn and Meme Tatane's removal from the DWMA, Jacqueline was ordered by Misery to keep Tsugumi grounded while the N.O.T. weapon recovered from injuries during Meme's defection to

   . Joined by Kim, Jacqueline checked in on Tsugumi to find the weapon attempting to escape. Realizing that Tsugumi, although only a N.O.T. student, practicing Soul Resonance with Anya so as to sense that meister's emotions, Jacqueline relented on keeping Tsugumi grounded. Persuading Kim to covertly heal Tsugumi's injuries, Jacqueline allowed Tsugumi to leave to find Anya and rescue Meme. When Shaula's possessed students attacked the girls' dormitory, Jacqueline transformed into her weapon form to be wielded by Kim in combat, working with other students and staff to protect the dormitory.

   After Kim's witch heritage is discovered by Shibusen, she flees with Jacqueline in fear. In reality the school had full intention to hear her out but the two men sent to approach her acted in a too hostile manner, provoking her into running. Kim and her weapon then become allied with the group Arachnophobia, a group that serves the witch

   During the Shibusen attack on Arachnophobia's base, Kim and Jacqueline are confronted by Ox, who risks his life to break Kim free from the brainwash caused by the machine. Kim, taking advantage of Ox's affections, managed to stab Ox with a knife, causing a deep, bloody wound. It is then that both Kim and Jacqueline begin to assault the injured Ox. Harver would soon find Ox, bloody and on the floor, at the hands of Kim and Jacqueline. Harver, realizing the seriousness of Ox's condition, prepares to battle Kim and Jacqueline. Harver, taking advantage of Kim's physique, changes his hand into the point of his lance form and proceeds to stab Kim, presumably killing her, much to the woe of Ox. Jacqueline, however, shows no sign of remorse over the likely death of Kim. The reason for this was that Kim was actually alive and used her witch powers to heal the fatal wound. Kim gets up and proceeds to battle Ox and Harver once more.

   It is when Ox breaks his antenna-like hairstyle—which he openly states is intentional—that he gets through to her, offering to create a place where she can go. She now seems to reciprocate Ox's feelings. Jackie, displeased with the situation, calls Kim a traitor and proceeds to attack Ox. Harver, now in his human form, appears behind Jackie and shocks her on her neck, knocking her out instantly.

   Jackie is seen conscious and back into her senses when the group locates Kilik Rung and aids in his battle. But, before they could proceed any further, the group was severely affected by Arachne's insanity, which had spread throughout the castle. Thanks to the actions of Maka and Soul, they were saved and able to aid in the conclusion of the assault.

   Jacqueline is seen in Shinigami's room alongside Kim, Tsubaki, and Angela. Sid and Death discuss the issue of what they should do with the two witches. Sid notes that Kim's regeneration magic is in conflict with the natural destructive magic, known as the witches’ sway of magic and is unlikely to be influenced; and that Angela is still too young for the sway of magic to have taken any hold, but it is no guarantee that she will not become a threat as she grows older. Horrified by this, Kim proposes that, if she were to periodically expose Angela to her regenerative magic, she might be able to suppress Angela's destructive instincts. She also proposes that, if that does not work, there is the option of using the Moral Manipulation Machine, brought back from Baba Yaga's Castle, on Angela.
