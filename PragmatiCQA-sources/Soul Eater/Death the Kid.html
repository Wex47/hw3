      I am a Shinigami. A real god. And I deem your manner of ruling to be wrong, Noah! 'Everything in the world' you say? You literally mean everything? How is that different from the 'Trans-Symmetrical Unity' I landed upon in the thrones of Madness? How can there be any aesthetic in 'everything'? There can be no beauty in an aesthetic without value!! It's about balance — a beautiful balance like perfect symmetry! You are not suitable for the task of ruler!! I'll show you a way of ruling that is bursting with beauty! If you survive, that is.

   's testament of his view on Death the Kid, despite being a Shinigami he is also capable of being humane and not displaying the typical arrogance of someone who has the status of a god.
   This is true, so much so that he even see's himself partly as a human and expressed this fact to

   that despite being a god, he doesn't deny evil and that there's no one person without some evil within them. However, he believes that everything is about balance instead and strives to keep the balance between "good" and "evil" in equilibrium.
   When expressing this, he also informed the Flying Dutchman that cares little for other's view on the subject and strives for a "absolutely" perfect world, granting no one freedom to kill.
   Kid's view on balance is partly due to his father's teachings to him on order as a child.
   Despite favoring order, he also aware of not following it blindly. He's quick to question his own father's actions when he had

   Despite his great capabilities, Kid also possesses some flaws, most notable him being a perfectionist to the point of having OCD/OD-esque qualities. Described as being "too much of a perfectionist",
   he initially was very obsessed and concerned with orderliness and paying excessively close attention to detail so much so he complained about Liz and Patty's breast size being irregular, chose them as weapons due to their twin appearance in their weapon forms, and even refused to attack the

    Wrath of the Pharaoh
   </a>
   due to symmetry. As well as this, he dislikes the fact that his

   </a>
   were incomplete and upon Liz pointing it out, he called himself an ugly pig and worthless piece of garbage until he was quickly cheered up by his fellow weapon partners.
   He is even physically repulsed by asymmetrical arrangements to the point he almost vomited at the sight.
   Due to his wanting to be precise in detail, it even took him over a month to help Liz pluck her eyebrows;
   in addition, he fails an entire test due to being unable to correctly write his name symmetrically and accidentally ripping the paper while erasing, before being reduced to tears, causing him to cough up blood and faint.
   He also let

   Despite being enrolled in counseling, it remained as a fatal and dangerous flaw.
   Even the mere sight of something asymmetrical causes him to become more aggressive, not only killing the

  <p key="5e55183f-3b59-4a9c-ba5a-5ca4bf978518">
   Despite this flaw, he is noticeable not unaffected by his father's appearance despite it being asymmetrical possibly due to his immense respect for him. This is a bit more evident when Kid was shown to even willingly sport the same robes of what his father wears on missions.
   As time passes throughout the series (and the anime), he becomes less affected of his perfectionist nature and matures enough to accept it, though will still occasionally bicker over small details.
   This remains true even when he became a true Shinigami.
   One of the earliest examples of this improvement is displayed when he claims not to care about the DWMA's broken spike as Black☆Star begins to descend into madness during their second duel.

   Kid has his own, odd quirks. His favorite number is eight due to its symmetry
   and, according to Liz, was willing to try and place himself in exactly eight seconds during a 100 meter dash test and end up not meeting the time.
   He can also be somewhat overconfident in his ability, feeling the need to not study

   While under the influence of the Madness of Power, Kid's personality changes dramatically due to his yearning for the perfect world. However, instead of balance, he strives to achieve "nothingness".
   He is willing to even kill an individual by using the power of "nothingness" to send a person to "nothingness", a flawed and somewhat absurd logic as pointed out by Black☆Star.
   In addition, unlike his typical personality, he also becomes arrogant, seeing himself as above others due to being a Shinigami.

   Kid's eyes have two shades of yellow ringing around his pupil. The outside ring is a bright yellow while the inner ring is a dark yellow, similar to the color of gold. He typically sports a standard black suit with white rectangles. The rectangles are placed in a manner that is completely symmetrical. There are at least six small rectangles along the seam where the sleeves attach to the jacket, and four small rectangles run along the front of his jacket. His undershirt is a formal white dress shirt, and a metallic skull rests under his collar, and could be used as a tie. His color scheme is meant to copy his father's. He also sports black hair with three white stripes, known as the Lines of Sanzu, along the left side of his hairline.

   Kid also wore a similar cloak during his mission to infiltrate Baba Yaga Castle, although this cloak resembled not his father's Shinigami robe but his usual dress jacket, except as a longcoat.
   Kid also will don different clothing during other activities, such as as a white dress suit for the

Kid is shown wearing a black cape similar to his father's, though he keeps his skull brooch. His pupils change to skull shapes, though they remain golden. His Sanzu lines are fully connected and are "floating" around his head. These changes are due to him becoming a full Shinigami.
   As soon as Kid returned from the fight on the Moon, the Lines of Sanzu settled on his hair once more, making him fully symmetrical.

Kid is soon unable to watch the onslaught brought on by Stein and wishes to aid them, but is stopped by his father, who states that this is for the DWMA students.

   There is constant talk regarding Kid enrolling at the DWMA. Black☆Star, being the person that he is, is angered that there is someone who is talked about more than he is. He then proceeds to go outside and wait for Kid to appear. Kid, however, is three hours late, as he spent the entire time making certain that everything was perfectly symmetrical before his departure. When Kid finally does arrive, he immediately begins to admire the supreme symmetry of the school building; however, he is quickly devastated when Black☆Star ruins the symmetry by standing on and breaking one of the spikes protruding out the main skull structure. This greatly angers Kid and he prepares to do battle with Black☆Star and

Angered by their failed attempts, Soul and Black☆Star choose to break up as partners but to stay as friends. While they are hugging, Kid shoots them both in the head. As the two get back up, they decide to renew their attacks on Kid, but separately this time. Black☆Star manages to grab Kid’s leg and pulls him onto the ground, and Soul seizes the opportunity to slash at Kid. Kid narrowly avoids this and breaks free from Black☆Star's grasp, all the while pulling Black☆Star into an embarrassing blow to his head. Kid responds to this barrage by performing a soul resonance with Liz and Patti. He then gets into

   As punishment for not gathering any souls from the extra lesson, Black☆Star is tasked with cleaning up the entirety of a library. However, instead of completing the task, he starts reading manga, and proceeds to make noise while doing so. It is at this moment that Death the Kid finds him there. Kid is at the library to borrow books, with his main purpose being to read about the holy sword

They inquire her about Excalibur. She instantly makes a disgusted face after she hears them say the name. The two soon reach the sword’s cavern and are impressed at the sight of the sword. Kid is especially fascinated by its beauty. When both try to pull it out, they are surprised at how easily they were able to. Excalibur then begins talking to them and changes into his human-like form.

   Kid and Black☆Star are amazed over how ridiculous Excalibur’s true form looks. Excalibur quickly begins to ask the boys trivial questions, while at the same time not giving them time to respond. On top of that the manner in which he waves his cane around, Excalibur referring to his own legend quickly angers Black☆Star. It is even revealed that the book of Excalibur was written by the Holy Sword himself. Excalibur then gives them a large amount of sheets, delineating all the things one must do to be able to wield him. After giving them the stack of papers, Excalibur finally declares them his Meisters. However, immediately after they hold him, the two put him back into the ground and leave in disgust.

   The following day, Black☆Star and Kid meet each other while walking down the hallway in the school. The two shake hands because of their good partnership.

It is at this point that he starts to cry, stating that he is garbage and that the letter "K" has abandoned him.

He reveals that three of the warriors were eaten by Asura and those that now remain, himself, Asura, Shinigami, Eibon, and one other of whom Kid knows, which is rumored to be Excalibur. In light of the revelation, Kid inquires about the whereabouts of Asura in as much as he is a warrior. The mass is not pleased by Kid's hasty questioning and responds by asserting the fact that he is not Kid's ally, nor anything else. As he utters these words, he says that the existence of the 8 Warriors drive men to madness whilst drenching Kid with a black, liquid-like substance. Quickly, Kid is consumed by darkness. He musters a smile and remarks on this new feeling.

   He seen floating in darkness, commenting on the darkness and likens it to nothingness, and in as much as there is no left nor right, is a unity that exceeds symmetry insofar that it is the zenith of order. The nothingness, shared amongst all living things is death. In light of this, he concludes that he must eliminate everything to create the "order".
  </p>
  <p key="a144b49f-c590-4f35-bd28-3fb3ef8695a3">
   He then speaks to the Mass telling him his goal to create the ultimate symmetry, the ultimate unity: nothingness. The black mass then tells him to try out his new-found power of madness, and Kid agrees. It is here he is confronted by his friends and appears ready to do battle with Black☆Star. Kid invites him and the two confront each other with Black☆Star saying that he will bring Kid back even if he's got to drag him back.

   Finally, he and Black☆Star face off in an underwater-like landscape. The two fight, and Kid admits to him that he is "big" and must be destroyed in order for Kid to make "nothingness." Just as Kid prepares a counter, the Black Mass gets in the way of Kid, to his disapproval. The Mass then turns to Black☆Star and asks him, "What is the 'power' you seek?"

   Black☆Star seems to have gained a new power from the black mass, and finally Kid and Black☆Star begin to fight. Several physical attacks are thrown, and then Kid activates one of the Lines of Sanzu. Then he blasts Black☆Star in the stomach and continues beating him. After Black☆Star gives him a few words, he punches Kid and sends him flying upwards. The both continue to kick and throw punches at each other and Black☆Star tries snapping Kid out of his insanity, saying that trying to make nothingness is the same as saying that balance is too hard for Kid to deal with, so he's trying to take the easy way out. He also argues that he does not have to be insane in order to be powerful.

   Elsewhere, Liz, Patti, Tsubaki, and the others await Black☆Star's return. During this time Liz remembers how she and Patti first met Kid, and how he saved them by thugs and how he had them be his new partners. She and Patti had been planning on using Kid's Shinigami status to gain the money and power they craved. However, the more time they spent with Kid, the more they grew to care for him, a fact Liz realizes after watching Patti laugh herself to tears. She thinks of how she and her sister hadn't cared about anyone but themselves before then, and if 'they had been killed by this shinigami'. It begins to rain money down on the group, and Liz thinks to herself that she doesn't care about money; all she wants is for Kid and Black☆Star to return safely. Patti and Tsubaki ask if she's ok, and she begins to cry, saying that she hadn't thanked him yet. Patti and Tsubaki simply smile and pull her into a hug.

   Back to the huge battle, where Black☆Star is talking to Kid once more, saying that while he may be using the power of insanity to become more powerful, losing himself to the insanity is nothing but a joke. "I figured it out," he says. "What I want to do once I get ultimate power in my hands." The scene quickly ends after the Black Mass appears, saying that he will no longer listen to their definitions of power.
  </p>
  <p key="afb54fef-bdce-4487-8924-2c6f4a08b5a8">
   Kid begins to think of the answer to power. He begins to go through what death gods are supposed to do, and realizes that Black☆Star is right, and thanks him. Black☆Star waves it off, saying that it was expected of him, since they were friends, and says that friendship is the only part of life not controlled by symmetry. Black☆Star then tells the black mass that, while his answer was "power" and "strength", but he was going to use his ultimate power to help Kid create the ultimate world.
  </p>
  <p key="069ee332-b965-4b13-93f7-f06a504237b0">
   The Black Mass quickly said that what they were talking about was political terror. Since Black☆Star had lived through the seven deadly sins, he asks what it would be called if you add one more to the sins. That is the answer to their question, it says. Kid replies that those with power are those who create order, those with power are those who make the standards for justice.

   Kid just came back and they heard what had happened. Kim asked him if he could change his father's mind about Crona as they were controlled by Medusa and that to ask Maka and the others to kill them was a hasty decision. Kid said what Crona did was unforgivable. With all that happened, their disposal was inevitable. Black☆Star grabbed Kid and said that was he here to just say this boring stuff and Kid told him to let him finish. There isn't really an thing called an absolute "order". In his mind he was thinking about what Eibon has said.
   Harvar

Even a cool-headed and rational guy like him (Harvard) can agree with this matter as everyone here has different ways of seeing things, but not everyone will agree together however in order to bring everyone together was "order". Even if this symbol is not followed, a Shinigami like Kid, doesn't side with this "order", humanity will be broken apart. However, not everyone agreed on this order to kill Crona, but his father wanted them to find an way to comfort someone who is not tied this "order" like them. No matter how low it is, they will have to move forward with this "order". Liz was proud of how much Kid has grown.

   it would probably become a mid-air battle, and Kid's skateboard skills would come in handy. He also mentioned another reason Kid should go was because the battle was a battle to regain "order". Kid told Soul and Maka that those were the orders, so he couldn't go with them to save Crona. He told them that his father couldn't go to the Moon so he, as a Shinigami, had to fight in his father's place. Kid also said that it may be irresponsible of him, but he hoped that Maka would be able to stop Crona and that he was leaving them to her. Maka understood. Soul told Kid not to die on them as the mission to suppress the Kishin was much more dangerous than theirs. Kid replied that he wouldn't, because Black☆Star would hold a grudge against him if he did. Kid then went to tell Soul that he knew that Black☆Star was getting stronger and was the strongest in the DWMA, and that it was frustrating but Black☆Star had always had this feelings about him in the past. Kid mentioned that he, however, would not stop there and would surpass Black☆Star once again. Kid then told Soul to not tell Black☆Star, as that would make him cocky. Soul agreed, and he and Kid bumped fists. Kid paused and asked to do this with the left hand, and right. Soul sighed and said that Kid would never change.

In his true Shinigami form, he is seen in a black cape, with eye pupils and a collar resembling Death's mask. Kid's Lines of Sanzu remain visible above his head.

   Afterwards, Kid feels an unnatural potential within him that he didn't feel before, and realizes it's a form of Madness that is the opposite of Asura's "Madness of Terror" called the "Madness of Order". While the Madness of Terror in Asura has is the power to make people lose their sense of humanity, the Madness of Order blocks senses altogether, and Kid smiles, realizing that his father didn't use that ability because he believed in humans, just as Kid himself did so with the Witches. He goes to finish the fight, with newfound faith, and newfound purpose. He aids Black Star in restraining Asura, which allows Maka to enter Asura's madness and save Crona from it. Crona then ultimately seals himself and Asura away in the black blood in the moon, defeating Asura.

   After Kid helped Maka and Black Star defeat Asura, the trio return to Death City. Unable to sense his father's wavelength, he runs to the Death Room, to discover Excalibur is the only one present. The weapon explains to Kid that because of his transformation into a Shinigami, his father had passed away. As Kid, heartbroken, collapses before the cloak of his father, he asks whether he has killed his father—only for Excalibur to dropkick the new Lord Death. Excalibur lectures: “The rulers of old are gone. Now is the age for humans to shape the world.” Kid is the beginning of that shaping. Kid, although crying, forces himself to don

   After being told by Spirit to take up the mantle of Death, Kid holds a ceremony a few weeks after the news of Death's passing announcing his desire to make the world a better place for humans. He takes up the mantle, and then requests Soul to join him as his new Death Scythe because Maka had turned him into one. In the last moments of the manga, Kid enjoys the celebration, especially upon discovering with his soul perception that Marie Mjolnir is pregnant with Stein's child, hence Kid has to be a good role model for a new generation of meisters and weapons.

     I am a Shinigami. A real god. And I deem your manner of ruling to be wrong, Noah! 'Everything in the world' you say? You literally mean everything? How is that different from the 'Trans-Symmetrical Unity' I landed upon in the thrones of madness? How can there be any aesthetic in 'everything'? There can be no beauty in an aesthetic without value!! It's about balance — a beautiful balance like perfect symmetry! You are not suitable for the task of ruler!! I'll show you a way of ruling that is bursting with beauty! If you survive, that is."
