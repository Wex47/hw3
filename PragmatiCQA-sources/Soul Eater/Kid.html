      I am a Shinigami. A real god. And I deem your manner of ruling to be wrong, Noah! 'Everything in the world' you say? You literally mean everything? How is that different from the 'Trans-Symmetrical Unity' I landed upon in the thrones of Madness? How can there be any aesthetic in 'everything'? There can be no beauty in an aesthetic without value!! It's about balance — a beautiful balance like perfect symmetry! You are not suitable for the task of ruler!! I'll show you a way of ruling that is bursting with beauty! If you survive, that is.

   Described as possessing an "uptight personality" by
   Franken Stein
   ,
   Death the Kid is known to be a normally calm and mature individual compared to those like

   .
   Throughout the series, he's shown to be prideful of his status as a
   Shinigami
   , wanting to become the next full-fledged Shinigami and inheriting his father's responsibilities
   However, he also wants to do so in his own unique way, even telling his own father he wants to makes his own weapons to his specifications despite Death informing him that as a Shinigami, he doesn't really need to collect souls.
   According to
   <a href="Black☆Star.html" key="e285bc71-65aa-409a-aee5-6bcae8f1dbcc" title="Black☆Star">
    Black☆Star
   </a>
   's testament of his view on Death the Kid, despite being a Shinigami he is also capable of being humane and not displaying the typical arrogance of someone who has the status of a god.
   This is true, so much so that he even see's himself partly as a human and expressed this fact to
   <a href="Asura.html" key="1c030379-5d7a-4f59-92fb-a4e4ffcdc6f8" title="Asura">
    Asura
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p key="0fd50ffe-646d-4ccb-a717-75bfe7c01fb7">
   Kid also has a great sense of morality and order, having expressed to the
   Flying Dutchman
   that despite being a god, he doesn't deny evil and that there's no one person without some evil within them. However, he believes that everything is about balance instead and strives to keep the balance between "good" and "evil" in equilibrium.
   When expressing this, he also informed the Flying Dutchman that cares little for other's view on the subject and strives for a "absolutely" perfect world, granting no one freedom to kill.
   Kid's view on balance is partly due to his father's teachings to him on order as a child.
   Despite favoring order, he also aware of not following it blindly. He's quick to question his own father's actions when he had
   the DWMA
   storm into Baghdad when searching for
   <a href="Asura.html" key="4f577fc5-cd80-4bd2-a971-8f69ef2add90" title="Asura">
    Asura
   </a>
   and explained that it's wrong to impose their will on others, though was understanding and sympathetic of his father when he realized that due to the threat of Asura, his father doesn't have the luxury of "playing it safe" and may be reckless in his decisions.
   When the majority of
   Spartoi
   was ordered to execute
   Crona
   , Kid was the only one who supported the action, citing that Crona's actions were unforgivable and even alluded that the reason why they were ordered to do so by his father was for them to decide how to face Crona but said that both them and "order" must move forward to take care of the threat Crona possessed.
  </p>
  <p key="c1e0a7a6-dde7-4fc9-a3cb-b15240c4d356">
   Kid is also extremely humble, shown when he pleaded to the
   Witch Order
   , the
   Witch Judge
   , and the
   Witch Queen
   to assist the DWMA in stopping
   The Clowns
   and pushed for both Humans, Witches, the DWMA, and the Witch Order to have better relations.
   He also put good faith and trust into the Witch Order, despite the protests of
   Azusa Yumi
   .
   He also explained to Azusa that merely holding ideals means nothing and one must realize that people must make an effort to make things better and that If being an adult means "stapling out ideals" because of experience, he doesn't mind being called "Kid".
   Because of his views, Azusa comments that he is also pushy, much like his father.
  </p>
  <p key="9e7d4928-a916-4f65-997e-a548a2edfebd">
   Like his father, he also has a fierce and much darker side in his personality. While normally calm and collective, Kid is still susceptible to being angered, such as when
   Mosquito
   insulted his father
   and when
   Noah's Group
   announced their plan to assassinate
   Maka Albarn
   , he showed a considerable amount of anger.
   When he later faced
   Noah (Greed)
   on his plans of "replacing the gods", Kid even gave him a death threat, in which was guaranteed when he used the
   Parent's Seven Rays
   attack on the
   Sorcerer
   , killing him.
  </p>
  <p key="5a160b07-a55a-47f1-a39e-dcd7aaef2a63">
   Despite his great capabilities, Kid also possesses some flaws, most notable him being a perfectionist to the point of having OCD/OD-esque qualities. Described as being "too much of a perfectionist",
   he initially was very obsessed and concerned with orderliness and paying excessively close attention to detail so much so he complained about Liz and Patty's breast size being irregular, chose them as weapons due to their twin appearance in their weapon forms, and even refused to attack the
   Wrath of the Pharaoh
   due to symmetry. As well as this, he dislikes the fact that his
   Lines of Sanzu
   were incomplete and upon Liz pointing it out, he called himself an ugly pig and worthless piece of garbage until he was quickly cheered up by his fellow weapon partners.
   He is even physically repulsed by asymmetrical arrangements to the point he almost vomited at the sight.
   Due to his wanting to be precise in detail, it even took him over a month to help Liz pluck her eyebrows;
   in addition, he fails an entire test due to being unable to correctly write his name symmetrically and accidentally ripping the paper while erasing, before being reduced to tears, causing him to cough up blood and faint.
   He also let
   Crona
   and
   Ragnarok
   get away to admire the sky and it's symmetry.
   Despite being enrolled in counseling, it remained as a fatal and dangerous flaw.
   Even the mere sight of something asymmetrical causes him to become more aggressive, not only killing the
   Wrath of the Pharaoh
   in a fit of rage, but also destroying the
   Pyramid Anubis
   due to his recklessness.
   In actuality, this part of his personality is a manifestation of the
   Madness of Order
   due to being a part of
   <a href="Death.html" key="fb48eb77-4466-47ce-9c30-1321988a0b85" title="Death">

   himself, a fact he himself is unaware of.
  </p>
  <p key="cfca27ef-bea1-4962-a84d-5b0cec5a62b3">
   Despite this flaw, he is noticeable not unaffected by his father's appearance despite it being asymmetrical possibly due to his immense respect for him. This is a bit more evident when Kid was shown to even willingly sport the same robes of what his father wears on missions.
   As time passes throughout the series (and the anime), he becomes less affected of his perfectionist nature and matures enough to accept it, though will still occasionally bicker over small details.
   This remains true even when he became a true Shinigami.
   One of the earliest examples of this improvement is displayed when he claims not to care about the DWMA's broken spike as Black☆Star begins to descend into madness during their second duel.
  </p>
  <p key="abdcac85-12dd-420c-add9-648a56e433bc">
   Kid has his own, odd quirks. His favorite number is eight due to its symmetry
   and, according to Liz, was willing to try and place himself in exactly eight seconds during a 100 meter dash test and end up not meeting the time.
   He can also be somewhat overconfident in his ability, feeling the need to not study
   Soul Studies
   just because he was a
   Shinigami
   .
   Due to his perfectionist personality, he is the type of person to recall and correct people on the small of detail, pointing out even when infected by the Madness of Power to
   <a href="Black☆Star.html" key="40bb514e-0b89-41b2-ae4b-c8e1ac26283d" title="Black☆Star">

   </a>
   he never punched him and instead used his heel during their fight when Black☆Star erroneously stated he punched him into submission, something the assassin noted to be unique to Kid.

  <p key="e3fc4830-0b04-4d7e-ae9f-621933aa5a56">
   While under the influence of the Madness of Power, Kid's personality changes dramatically due to his yearning for the perfect world. However, instead of balance, he strives to achieve "nothingness".
   He is willing to even kill an individual by using the power of "nothingness" to send a person to "nothingness", a flawed and somewhat absurd logic as pointed out by Black☆Star.
   In addition, unlike his typical personality, he also becomes arrogant, seeing himself as above others due to being a Shinigami.

  <p key="336ae180-3fce-49c0-9003-31255ce78441">
   Death the Kid appeared as a thin, teenaged young man who is a bit shorter than Liz and Patty and reaches only up a little past the latter's shoulder.
  </p>
  <p key="dd4fce14-9c11-4843-8e58-d65251771f01">
   Kid's eyes have two shades of yellow ringing around his pupil. The outside ring is a bright yellow while the inner ring is a dark yellow, similar to the color of gold. He typically sports a standard black suit with white rectangles. The rectangles are placed in a manner that is completely symmetrical. There are at least six small rectangles along the seam where the sleeves attach to the jacket, and four small rectangles run along the front of his jacket. His undershirt is a formal white dress shirt, and a metallic skull rests under his collar, and could be used as a tie. His color scheme is meant to copy his father's. He also sports black hair with three white stripes, known as the Lines of Sanzu, along the left side of his hairline.
  </p>
  <p key="aec0471e-2e1c-4250-aa38-7982d2f763ae">
   On some missions, Kid dons a cloak and mask that resemble his father's current wear out of pure enjoyment of liking it.
   Kid also wore a similar cloak during his mission to infiltrate Baba Yaga Castle, although this cloak resembled not his father's Shinigami robe but his usual dress jacket, except as a longcoat.
   Kid also will don different clothing during other activities, such as as a white dress suit for the
   <a href="Death Weapon Meister Academy.html" key="d957f706-b7b5-46ab-bc81-b59a30b4e35e" title="Death Weapon Meister Academy">

   Gallows Mansion
   or Maka and Soul's apartment.

  <p key="c6be2ef5-cc27-4946-81cc-648b0f0d33b7">
   After the time-skip and being rescued by
   Spartoi
   and joining, he appears slightly more aged and taller, enough to almost reach to his father's shoulder.
   His attire changed to that of alater attire that consists of white dress shirt, black tie, a white sports jacket similar to that of Liz and Patty, a white suit jacket with the Spartoi symbol on its left sleeve, navy pants, and white shoes.
  </p>
  <p key="f99294b9-ba1f-4753-ab73-3ec11a84e08d">
   He later wears a simple black shirt with a black jacket along with black shoes when acting independently. His color scheme have further seem to mimic his father, the only variation in color now from his face.
   Upon his departure from the Moon to negotiate with the witches, Kid returns to his previous look before the timeskip.

  <p key="cbdeac3b-575c-4e01-a88d-e7fde78672d9">
   During his time under the influence of the
   Madness of Power
   inside the
   Book of Eibon
   , Kid sports a black suit with white stripes and a white cravat along with black pants and black shoes. He also appears to have 5 black lines on the area of the mouth and lips, appears as if his mouth is sewed shut.
  </p>
  <p key="8ff595c4-f59d-4b11-be71-2c6fa5e27f74">
   According to both Liz and Patty, Kid shares a resemblance to

   Upon connecting the Lines of Sanzu during his battle against Asura on the Moon, Kid's appearance changes for the remainder of the series. Kid is shown wearing a black cape similar to his father's, though he keeps his skull brooch. His pupils change to skull shapes, though they remain golden. His Sanzu lines are fully connected and are "floating" around his head. These changes are due to him becoming a full Shinigami.
   As soon as Kid returned from the fight on the Moon, the Lines of Sanzu settled on his hair once more, making him fully symmetrical.

   surrounding the soul.

   As he got older, he grew a reputation for being a very talented and able fighter. Many students felt as if no one could compete with him. Eventually, he expanded his interest in being a meister for his own specification. He eventually heard of the Thompson Sisters and was said to bring them into custody.

   Death the Kid is first introduced while in the process of conducting a mission with his twin pistols (Liz and Patty Thompson). After failing the mission to capture
   Lupin
   , he speaks to his father,
   Shinigami
   , and decides to go after the witch
   Samantha
   . She is controlling mummies at the pyramid of Anubis. Upon arriving, Kid begins to worry about the symmetry of a picture hanging in his room back home. Kid leaves his weapons alone in the pyramid. The sisters manage to defeat the mummies, but are later captured by the
   Pharaoh
   . When Kid eventually returns, he finds that his partners are being held captive. After successfully releasing them, Liz and Patty transform but Kid doesn't fight as he realizes that the Pharaoh's coffin is perfect symmetrical. The Pharaoh beats the unwilling Kid down. Kid then lies on the ground as the Pharaoh prepares for the final blow. The Pharaoh comes out of his coffin to end it, but Kid notices nothing symmetrical about it anymore but the smiley-face-like jewel on his forehead. Kid then gets up and shoots the pharaoh down, destroying everything but the jewel. However, in the process, he destroyed the pyramid of Anubis. As punishment, Shinigami takes all the souls he had collected.

   Kid is later seen watching the battle between Stein and the the DWMA students. He is shocked at the revelation and personally believes that they will all die at the hands of Stein. As the battle proceeds, Kid is astonished by Stein's masterful use of wavelength without the use of a weapon. Kid is soon unable to watch the onslaught brought on by Stein and wishes to aid them, but is stopped by his father, who states that this is for the DWMA students. Kid then decides that, henceforth, he, Liz, and Patti will be the DWMA students.On his way out of his father's room, Kid is seen stumbling as he believes he forgot to fold the edge of his toilet paper into a triangle.

   There is constant talk regarding Kid enrolling at the DWMA. Black☆Star, being the person that he is, is angered that there is someone who is talked about more than he is. He then proceeds to go outside and wait for Kid to appear. Kid, however, is three hours late, as he spent the entire time making certain that everything was perfectly symmetrical before his departure. When Kid finally does arrive, he immediately begins to admire the supreme symmetry of the school building; however, he is quickly devastated when Black☆Star ruins the symmetry by standing on and breaking one of the spikes protruding out the main skull structure. This greatly angers Kid and he prepares to do battle with Black☆Star and
   Soul
   . During battle, Kid uses his twin pistols with great dexterity and handles both Soul and Black☆Star with extreme ease.

   The fight soon attracts the attention of the students inside the school; leading to Maka,

   Despite their attempt
   , it fails horribly with Soul landing on Black☆Star's head in scythe form and Black☆Star being unable to lift Soul due to the horrible connection they have between their souls. Angered by their failed attempts, Soul and Black☆Star choose to break up as partners but to stay as friends. While they are hugging, Kid shoots them both in the head. As the two get back up, they decide to renew their attacks on Kid, but separately this time. Black☆Star manages to grab Kid’s leg and pulls him onto the ground, and Soul seizes the opportunity to slash at Kid. Kid narrowly avoids this and breaks free from Black☆Star's grasp, all the while pulling Black☆Star into an embarrassing blow to his head. Kid responds to this barrage by performing a soul resonance with Liz and Patti. He then gets into
   Execution Mode
   and performs
   Death Cannon
   . This creates a large explosion that knocks both boys out.Kid, surprisingly, loses consciousness too for seemingly unknown reasons. It is then revealed by Maka that, when Soul attempted to slash at Kid, he had cut some of Kid’s bangs, with Kid not noticing the broken symmetry until after the explosion. Soul and Black☆Star both agree that this was their

   As punishment for not gathering any souls from the extra lesson, Black☆Star is tasked with cleaning up the entirety of a library. However, instead of completing the task, he starts reading manga, and proceeds to make noise while doing so. It is at this moment that Death the Kid finds him there. Kid is at the library to borrow books, with his main purpose being to read about the holy sword
   Excalibur
   . Kid is fascinated by its possible symmetry, while Black☆Star is by the fame it entails. Their interest is piqued further after they hear from Stein that Excalibur was impossible even for himself. With that, they go to search for the sword.

   Eventually, they reach the northern part of Priten Island/Britain Island. Their first obstacle is to climb a large cliff. Kid easily does so by riding on his
   Beelzebub
   . Black☆Star is forced to climb it bare-handed. After Black☆Star climbs it, he soon reaches the cave and sees Kid hanging off of an obstacle. Kid begs Black☆Star to carry him, because he does not want to step in water. Eventually, Black☆Star gives in and carries Kid. While walking through the cave, they pass by a fairy. They inquire her about Excalibur. She instantly makes a disgusted face after she hears them say the name. The two soon reach the sword’s cavern and are impressed at the sight of the sword. Kid is especially fascinated by its beauty. When both try to pull it out, they are surprised at how easily they were able to. Excalibur then begins talking to them and changes into his human-like form.

  <p key="2ca083d6-089c-4672-90c8-281f10e96032">
   Kid and Black☆Star are amazed over how ridiculous Excalibur’s true form looks. Excalibur quickly begins to ask the boys trivial questions, while at the same time not giving them time to respond. On top of that the manner in which he waves his cane around, Excalibur referring to his own legend quickly angers Black☆Star. It is even revealed that the book of Excalibur was written by the Holy Sword himself. Excalibur then gives them a large amount of sheets, delineating all the things one must do to be able to wield him. After giving them the stack of papers, Excalibur finally declares them his Meisters. However, immediately after they hold him, the two put him back into the ground and leave in disgust.

   The following day, Black☆Star and Kid meet each other while walking down the hallway in the school. The two shake hands because of their good partnership. Kid then notices that some of the other students are laughing at them. The reason is because Excalibur has sent a pair of giant gifts to them, with the message “I’ll always be waiting for you".

   Kid is with his two partners, along with Black☆Star and Tsubaki, in Maka and Soul's apartment. They had all just finished eating Maka's food. Kid then compliments Soul for having a nice, clean apartment. He then asks if just Maka and Soul lives here. This question was answered when
   Blair
   makes an appearance, in a towel, and asks if anyone would like to take a bath with her. Blair's towel then falls off; Kid is astonished and Soul suffers the typical nose bleed. Death the Kid does not suffer from one; however, he is reasonably surprised.

   At his house, instead of studying, and while checking up on Patti and Liz, Kid notices that Liz is plucking her eyebrows. He asks if he should be the one who plucks them, so her right and left eyebrows match perfectly. Liz rejects his offer, because it took Kid a month last time. Kid then begs Liz, until she accepts. Before Kid even works on them, he begins to draw a design.

Even after the hour had almost passed, he is still trying to write his name. This time, the "K" in "Death the Kid" is spaced wrong and has to rub out the letter lots of times, after numerous failed attempts. It is at this point that he starts to cry, stating that he is garbage and that the letter "K" has abandoned him. However; as he is viciously rubbing his mistake out, he mistakenly rips the test paper; horrified by this, he coughs out blood then propels off his chair, onto the floor and passes out (symmetrically).

In light of the revelation, Kid inquires about the whereabouts of Asura in as much as he is a warrior. The mass is not pleased by Kid's hasty questioning and responds by asserting the fact that he is not Kid's ally, nor anything else. As he utters these words, he says that the existence of the 8 Warriors drive men to madness whilst drenching Kid with a black, liquid-like substance. Quickly, Kid is consumed by darkness. He musters a smile and remarks on this new feeling.

   He seen floating in darkness, commenting on the darkness and likens it to nothingness, and in as much as there is no left nor right, is a unity that exceeds symmetry insofar that it is the zenith of order. The nothingness, shared amongst all living things is death. In light of this, he concludes that he must eliminate everything to create the "order".

  <p key="d7a4a408-2c38-42a0-ad63-414f65a52cbc">
   He then speaks to the Mass telling him his goal to create the ultimate symmetry, the ultimate unity: nothingness.

She and Patti had been planning on using Kid's Shinigami status to gain the money and power they craved.

   Kid begins to think of the answer to power. He begins to go through what death gods are supposed to do, and realizes that Black☆Star is right, and thanks him. Black☆Star waves it off, saying that it was expected of him, since they were friends, and says that friendship is the only part of life not controlled by symmetry. Black☆Star then tells the black mass that, while his answer was "power" and "strength", but he was going to use his ultimate power to help Kid create the ultimate world.
  </p>
  <p key="34948964-2581-4ba7-856a-9770ffd7847d">
   The Black Mass quickly said that what they were talking about was political terror. Since Black☆Star had lived through the seven deadly sins, he asks what it would be called if you add one more to the sins. That is the answer to their question, it says. Kid replies that those with power are those who create order, those with power are those who make the standards for justice.

Even a cool-headed and rational guy like him (Harvard) can agree with this matter as everyone here has different ways of seeing things, but not everyone will agree together however in order to bring everyone together was "order". Even if this symbol is not followed, a Shinigami like Kid, doesn't side with this "order", humanity will be broken apart. However, not everyone agreed on this order to kill Crona, but his father wanted them to find an way to comfort someone who is not tied this "order" like them. No matter how low it is, they will have to move forward with this "order". Liz was proud of how much Kid has grown.

   Stein asked Shinigami to remove Kid from the Spartoi's mission and to have him on the mission to suppress the Kishin. Death agreed, because since they were going to
   the Moon
   it would probably become a mid-air battle, and Kid's skateboard skills would come in handy. He also mentioned another reason Kid should go was because the battle was a battle to regain "order". Kid told Soul and Maka that those were the orders, so he couldn't go with them to save Crona. He told them that his father couldn't go to the Moon so he, as a Shinigami, had to fight in his father's place. Kid also said that it may be irresponsible of him, but he hoped that Maka would be able to stop Crona and that he was leaving them to her. Maka understood. Soul told Kid not to die on them as the mission to suppress the Kishin was much more dangerous than theirs. Kid replied that he wouldn't, because Black☆Star would hold a grudge against him if he did. Kid then went to tell Soul that he knew that Black☆Star was getting stronger and was the strongest in the DWMA, and that it was frustrating but Black☆Star had always had this feelings about him in the past. Kid mentioned that he, however, would not stop there and would surpass Black☆Star once again. Kid then told Soul to not tell Black☆Star, as that would make him cocky. Soul agreed, and he and Kid bumped fists. Kid paused and asked to do this with the left hand, and right. Soul sighed and said that Kid would never change.

   While flying to the Moon, Azusa doubts the witches will help them given their history and pointed out that Kid is still a kid. He replied by saying if that the adult thinks, and then he rather be a "kid" forever. He told Azusa that if she doesn't have faith in the witches then have faith in him.

   As Kid is about to connect his third line, a triple halo appears above Death. This halo closely resembles the lines on Kid's head. Once Kid connects all of his lines, Death falls to the ground only with a pile of his robe seen. After Kid awakens, his soul wavelength swells up to an enormous size that is about the size of Death's.
In his true Shinigami form, he is seen in a black cape, with eye pupils and a collar resembling Death's mask. Kid's Lines of Sanzu remain visible above his head.

   Afterwards, Kid feels an unnatural potential within him that he didn't feel before, and realizes it's a form of Madness that is the opposite of Asura's "Madness of Terror" called the "Madness of Order". While the Madness of Terror in Asura has is the power to make people lose their sense of humanity, the Madness of Order blocks senses altogether, and Kid smiles, realizing that his father didn't use that ability because he believed in humans, just as Kid himself did so with the Witches. He goes to finish the fight, with newfound faith, and newfound purpose. He aids Black Star in restraining Asura, which allows Maka to enter Asura's madness and save Crona from it. Crona then ultimately seals himself and Asura away in the black blood in the moon, defeating Asura.

   After Kid helped Maka and Black Star defeat Asura, the trio return to Death City. Unable to sense his father's wavelength, he runs to the Death Room, to discover Excalibur is the only one present. The weapon explains to Kid that because of his transformation into a Shinigami, his father had passed away. As Kid, heartbroken, collapses before the cloak of his father, he asks whether he has killed his father—only for Excalibur to dropkick the new Lord Death. Excalibur lectures: “The rulers of old are gone. Now is the age for humans to shape the world.” Kid is the beginning of that shaping. Kid, although crying, forces himself to don

   After being told by Spirit to take up the mantle of Death, Kid holds a ceremony a few weeks after the news of Death's passing announcing his desire to make the world a better place for humans. He takes up the mantle, and then requests Soul to join him as his new Death Scythe because Maka had turned him into one. In the last moments of the manga, Kid enjoys the celebration, especially upon discovering with his soul perception that Marie Mjolnir is pregnant with Stein's child, hence Kid has to be a good role model for a new generation of meisters and weapons.
