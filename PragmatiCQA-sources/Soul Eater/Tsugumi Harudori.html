   Tsugumi has a shy, excitable personality. Having come from a cozy life, Tsugumi still finds it a little hard to adapt to the DWMA, a place chock-full of strange things and people steeped in the supernatural. Out of all the academy students, she is shown to be the most normal if not mundane, because of this she is slightly reluctant around people she's not acquainted with and can get frightened or very nervous easily. She is also embarrassed very easily, often blushing. She is rather naïve and believes (and fears) in the supernatural, as she believes

  </p>
  <p key="62685754-2c11-4431-b5f1-248dd0a05b55">
   Tsugumi occasionally feels self-doubt, retreating from difficult challenges, especially when doubting her worthiness as a weapon to Anya or Meme and what purpose she has as a NOT student at the DWMA.
   After meeting
   Maka
   , and after encouragement from her teacher
   <a href="Sid Barrett.html" key="73349a2a-e6ed-4a6b-b2b6-0f6453157261" title="Sid Barrett">

   and her meisters, Tsugumi grows more confident during her time at the DWMA, eventually confronting the witch

   and killing her. Although she still is passive after this effort, overall Tsugumi can still pluck up her courage and stand up for herself when it really matters.
  </p>
  <p key="3d34a05b-f205-42fd-9581-072a0e16f3a4">
   Tsugumi is kindhearted towards other people, smiling almost all the time and trying to please everybody. Beyond her nervousness, even with Kim, she proves to be enthusiastic in everything she does and tries her best at all times, shown when she puts a lot of effort in working at the Deathbucks Cafe, and is quite modest as well. She dislikes violence and sometimes tries to diffuse an argument or tell a person to not be so mean. She values friendship greatly, and is eager (albeit slightly nervous) at the concept of having a Meister partner in the DWMA. She states that she forgets all of her troubles whilst being with her friends. Despite having two people wanting to be her Meister, she makes a great effort to try and be both of their partners and make sure no one is left out. She is prone to looking up to people as idols and trying to become like them, even going as far as to imitate her idols' physical appearance.
  </p>
  <p key="48e7a405-1dac-4472-8d49-61cdadf73e6d">
   She also describes herself as 'in love with love,' showing that she is a dreaming romantic. When it comes to romance, she has a bit of a wild imagination and is prone to daydream a little, although she tries not to take her daydreams too far. She at first, dreamt of being in the middle of a love triangle between two cute boys who both wanted to be her partner, and was a bit disappointed when she ended up having two

   wanting to be her partner instead. She is shown to be slightly more nervous around boys such as
   Akane
   and
   Clay
   .
  </p>
  <p key="02e32cd2-8a85-4134-b1d0-df9b6d762c8e">
   Tsugumi also has low self-esteem regarding her body type, envious of her peers such as Meme and Jacqueline for their larger busts
   and Anya for her slender legs. Like Maka, Tsugumi has a small bust, which often causes her to feel depressed when others call her "flat-chested",
   which prompted her to choose her DWMA uniform because it obscures the shape of her body.
   She will even refuse compliments about her appearance; when Akane calls her "cute," Tsugumi stubbornly replies that she is not.
  </p>
  <p key="f2004eb8-50e6-42c1-9b20-402abc91d755">
   Tsugumi's low self-esteem also causes her to question her abilities as a student and a weapon, as she admits that she has never experienced any hardships and is easily scared. Despite her low self-confidence, Tsugumi is able to face her fears with courage in order to try her best.

   Tsugumi is a young girl of Japanese descent, with a short, petite frame, and a fair skin-tone. She has shoulder-length, black hair, and indigo eyes. Her hair is stringy, with short, choppy bangs with a tuft on top, long eartails, and pigtails on the sides of her head. Later, she puts it in a pigtailed style inspired by
   <a href="Maka Albarn.html" key="681d4cf1-a3f6-4708-90fa-1c60ff1e2bf9" title="Maka Albarn">

   . This style features the classic pigtails still retaining her side bangs with her pigtails have two ponytails instead one and her hair isn't completely tied with loose strands still hanging. The hairstyle also has the same ruffle of hair as mentioned before. She later change's this from time to time by smoothing down all of her bangs and tying her pigtails so that they fall to behind her neck.
  </p>
  <p key="e069b540-e41d-4b77-bc30-605f26e66101">
   Her standard attire consists of black colored sailor fuku adorned with a white sailor collar with a black stripe running through it and a white tie of which ends in the shape and style of
   Shinigami
   's mask. She has a black jumper beneath a black vest and her skirt is black and gray with an argyle print with white trimming. She wears a pair of black knee-high boots over black pinstripe knee-high socks. She, like Maka is also shown not to be as "heavenly gifted" as other girls.

  <p key="e59fd30e-360a-4174-b48c-e78ddf5633db">
   When working part-time at
   Deathbucks Café
   , she wears its waitress uniform. She wears a small cap in the shape of Shinigami's mask, along with a dress shirt with puffy shoulders tied and black ribbons along with a large extravagant polka dot bow tie. Above that, she wears a well-fitting black dress held up with suspenders, tied with a ribbon behind her back and with cross-stitches on the front. The skirt fans out at her thighs and has a white stripe going across the bottom. She wears white knee-length stockings and black shoes.

They then spot a room marked the Anti-Witch Headquarters, hidden inside the school. Upon entering, they find Akane and Clay inside; while Clay struggles to explain why they are in this secret room on their day off from classes, Akane claims Sid works in this office and asked them to bring donuts. The two lead Tsugumi and her meisters out of the Academy. As Tsugumi thinks about how difficult it is to choose a meister between Anya and Meme, Akane again teases her that he could be her meister, shocking Anya, Meme, and Clay.

   But Tsugumi is distracted by the bandage over Eternal Feather's neck, realizing the dangers of being a student at the DWMA. Tsugumi also notices the blood in Stein's office, as well as that on Meme and Anya's outfits, likely from tending to the injured Eternal Feather, which only makes Tsugumi feel more guilt for her inability to protect Anya or Eternal Feather. Tsugumi then notices Eternal Feather has both of her pigtails, even though she remembers seeing that pigtail cut off. The pigtail then moves, taking a pen and using it to write on her pillow, scaring the trio. Tsugumi and her meisters are then more horrified before Eternal Feather's head falls off and chases them. Stein picks up the head and reveals it is merely a
