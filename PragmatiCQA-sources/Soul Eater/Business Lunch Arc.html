   Black Star throws the large star through Screech Delta, slicing through that technique, knocking into Crona, and shooting upward. As Tsubaki's second form descends, at the moment she is before Crona, Black Star dashes forward and puts his wrist through the opening in the second form, producing a massive amount of energy that repels Crona. Tsubaki's second form, swirling around Black Star's wrist, spins as it decreases in size around Black Star's wrist.

   Tsubaki tries again to reach out to Crona, claiming that they have no intention to injure Crona and only wish to return their friends at the DWMA. Crona seems to remember betraying these people, hence feels that they cannot face these people ever again. Crona concludes that at least with Medusa they will get the power to defeat anyone. Black Star claims power is nothing compared to friends, but Crona still intends to kill him.

   Then
   Vector Arrows
   head towards Justin, revealing that Justin merely gave Medusa a madness-influence nightmare. Medusa explains she created a fail-safe—the
   Portable Purple Clown
   —to automatically release should she fall under a hallucination, similar to the one she had under
   Arachne's Madness
   earlier
   . Justin is disgusted that Medusa would perform yet another "blasphemy," when Clowns belong to Asura. Medusa replies, "I'm a witch--blasphemy is our job."

   Justin and Medusa continue their battle, his madness-influenced body and his
   Silver Gun
   able to repel or destroy her Purple Clown-infused snakes. But as Justin lands on the floor, he is confronted by Medusa—and another iteration of Justin. Justin is, predictably, confused, but so is Medusa—because she sees Justin but, rather than a second iteration of him, a second iteration of herself. Justin quickly recognizes this subterfuge: the doppelganger is
   Tezca Tlipoca
   . Images of Justin's past pass through his mind, as he stands before the Clown then

   . Justin tells Tezca not to "reflect what's in my heart." Tezca explains that his mirror reflects people. Medusa looks nervous, as an image of Crona comes to her mind. Tezca urges Justin to turn back to the DWMA, reminding him how long they have been such good friends, having long conversations together. But Justin says he does not know what Tezca is saying, as his earphones are too loud and Tezca's mask blocks his lips. Tezca slowly realizes that Justin has never heard a word he has ever said in any conversation, even when he thought they were friends together at the DWMA. While Tezca and his meister
   Enrique
   scream repeatedly in horror, Justin and Medusa grow tired of his antics and depart. Although they failed to capture them, Tezca tells Enrique that he managed to reflect Justin's soul, so now he can track him.

Stein adds that, even if the witches agree, they still will be prohibited by the DWMA from engaging in certain actions. Death explains that Kid was trapped in the Book of Eibon, but as the DWMA possesses a manuscript copy of Eibon's book, Risa and Arisa can create a magic link to retrieve Kid. Arisa claims the

   she and Risa would have to perform is too complicated: Death would do better with a different witch. Black☆Star arrives with such a witch—by shoving Eruka, in frog form, in Death's face. They are then interrupted by the arrival of

But studying Gopher's caret-shaped frown, Kid panicks: the left side of his frown is slightly lower than the right side. Facing such asymmetry, Kid screams for salvation from this torture.
   Realizing how he can torture him, Gopher has ripped one of Kid's sleeves, leaving his shirt uneven. But worse, Gopher also has taken a marker to half of Kid's face, exaggerating his eyelashes and nose hair with additional lines drawn across half of his face. Kid meekly begs for someone to save him.
   Gopher then rubs Kid's chest with a back-scratcher—just the right side of his chest, as Kid begs for Gopher to make the rubbing symmetrical. While Gopher is amused, he stops laughing when he realizes an annoyed Noah is behind him. "You have gone too far this time, Gopher," Noah warns, as he is displeased to see "a prized piece of my collection, reduced to this sorry state by your antics." Noah takes Kid's chin in his hand, studying the asymmetrical damage. Noah orders Gopher to depart and to do something to earn back his trust, such as by bringing him tea. As Gopher departs, Noah opens the Book of Eibon, which sucks Kid back into its pages.

   Annoyed at his asymmetrical attire, Kid rips off the left sleeve to his shirt, using it to rub away the marker doodles covering the right side of his face. Upon making himself more symmetrical, Kid realizes that Noah has trapped him within a deeper portion of the Book, likely to prevent Kid from re-arranging the contents yet again. Whereas the Book is usually a white field with obscure markings, he notices a swirling mass of black below him. A
   Soul Wavelength
   emerges from this mass, pricking at Kid. Finding this wavelength "disgusting," Kid is surprised to see what resembles a face emerge from
   this mass
   . Kid urges someone to rescue him from this book and its contents immediately.
