   Blair is very good at understanding other people and even showing kindness to others who are troubled. She is always looking for some fun, whether it is harmless or not. Playful and fun-loving, she is quite an affable person. She is well endowed, which is used when she flirts with Soul, usually by appearing out of her cat form in little to no clothing. Blair has no shame in exposing her naked body in the presence of males, exemplified by when she pulls down her towel in front of Soul and Maka's guests. This is most likely due to the fact that, in her cat form, she is always naked.

   In human form, she takes on the appearance of a young, tall woman with large breasts and an alluring figure. She has short violet hair with long strands on each side of her face that curl up and around to resemble her tail. The bauble she wears in her cat form can be seen below her neck. She has a set of purple cat-like ears with pink tips instead of human ears, which are initially hidden by her hat. Her black witch's hat coils around at the end and retains her bright yellow cat eyes. She also has a curled up purple cat tail that resembles her cat form one. Her lips are curled like the shape of a "3" to represent those of a cat. She also has two little sharp fangs in her mouth in human form like a cat's. She dresses in many types of revealing clothing such as tank tops and bikinis, but her signature witch outfit consists of a black-blue dress that shows off her shoulders and wraps around her neck, long, open sleeves that reveal her hands and shoulders, a short skirt with a white frill and long high-heeled boots that curl upwards at the toes. When fighting against Mizune's human form, she keeps her hat and boots but switches her dress for a black-blue bikini top under a similar-colored coat with a fur collar, and matching shorts. The coat's bottom hem is notably short, ending just below her breasts, exposing her stomach and lower back.

   during her transformation to the opposite sex as a result of the Lust Chapter, her seductive figure is carried on even to the opposite gender, and she appears as a highly attractive young man with a well-muscled build with black pants tight on the knees and matching shoes, an opened shirt showing her bare chest. Her witch hat remains but it is shorter, more like a top hat or a fedora but the top still has the curly tip. The bauble on her chest that resembles her cat collar has now turned into a necklace. She has also got a belt and a second, thin belt hanging down to her left.

Without any hesitation in an attempt to be "manly", Soul jumps and kicked one of the windows, breaking into the bathroom and landing headfirst in her bust in the bathtub. As he realizes Blair is naked, he gets a nosebleed as a result. As she questions on what happened, Soul reassures that he's a cool guy and is used to seeing women naked. However, Blair reminds him his nose is bleeding. Maka then appears and strikes her weapon with a dropkick, telling Blair that they're after her soul. However, Blair is seemingly more concerned about his well-being. As Maka orders Soul to transform into

   , Blair is impressed at his ability. Maka then states she will take Blair's soul and make a

As Soul and Maka argue once more, Blair interrupts and states that Soul should be with her instead and she would forgive him for everything he does. However, Maka refutes the statement, saying Soul is her scythe and she has to go through her first with making "deals" such as that. With those words, Blair's demeanor changes into a more serious one as states she intends to kill Maka and take Soul. The battle continues as Blair has the upperhand, countering and dodging Maka's attacks. As she dodges, she casts the Smashing Pumpkin spell. She then uses Zukun to send Maka into the air.

   After saving Maka and Soul with her Pumpkin Cannon from the Dutchman's attack with the factory's own pipes, Blair steals the Dutchman's hat, distracting him while Maka and Soul fight the Clown and eventually defeat it. Blair leads the Dutchman through the entire factory, her cat size allowing her to fit in small spaces that the Dutchman cannot fit through, leaving him torn and bruised by the factory's machinery. The Dutchman manages to trap Blair in one furnace, but she survives, whether by those remaining souls out of her original nine or by the failure of the furnace to hurt her.

   Blair finally drops the Dutchman's hat atop the factory's self-destruct button. As the Dutchman picks up the hat, he accidentally hits his hand against the button, destroying the factory and, because his body is an extension of that factory, himself. Blair is reunited with Maka and Soul, as they turn around to see the factory evaporate into harmless light.

   Blair is called along with her Chupa♡Cabra's colleagues Risa and Arisa to the

After punishing Spirit for misleading Blair and her coworkers, Death explains that these three magic users, along with Kim Diehl and the recently captured Eruka Frog, will use their magic for a DWMA mission. Blair and these witches will use their magic to transport DWMA forces into the

   Blair reverts to cat form and stays as such for the remainder of their time inside the Book. After passing through the Gluttony Chapter, Blair and most of the DWMA students are separated from Soul and Maka. While the students eventually resume their previous gender, with Liz and Tsubaki as the last to revert to women, Blair stays in cat form, their sex assumed by Liz and Tsubaki to still be male due to Blair's supposed lustfulness.

   Upon reaching the Greed Chapter, Black☆Star is invited by the Table of Contents to retrieve Kid from the Hidden Chapter. Upon convincing the
   Great Old One of Power
   to release Kid, this being releases them as well as their classmates and Blair out of the Book. At this moment, Noah has brought the book outside of
   base
   to fight other members of DWMA. Blair, resuming her female sex, uses her magic to assist Maka and their teammates in a fight that leaves Noah dead, Gopher escaping with the Book of Eibon, Tezca Tlipoca seemingly dead, and the members of DWMA too injured to pursue.

   While Maka and Soul recover from injuries and the loss of Crona in their apartment, the barely dressed Blair pushes Soul into her breasts, causing him a nosebleed. While likely influenced by the Madness of Boobs, Maka notices Blair's breasts, then grows irate at Blair's behavior towards Soul. Blair pulls Maka in for a hug, claiming three is more fun. Maka's eyes again glaze over as her face is close to Blair's breasts. The scene ends here without clarification as to what happens next.
