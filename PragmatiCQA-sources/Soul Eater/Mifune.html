   Often stoic in nature and staunch in attitude, Mifune tends be somewhat quiet in situations that do not directly involve him
   and remains mostly serious as well as being straight-forward, especially toward those he would consider a threat.
   In addition, he admits even after his employment of Arachnophobia that he often swung his sword in defense of other children, possessing a great level of compassion and care for those he consider young.
   In battle, he is analytical, seeing slight movements and small details and immediately noting them, whether it be out loud or within the confines of his thoughts.
   He's also not above calling out other individuals on negative traits. He pointed out

   on more then one occasion in an attempt to blow away his young opponent's vanity, and even advise his adversary on how to be a better warrior.
   Being a strong follower of the
   Path of a Warrior
   , he is willing to give respect to his opponents no matter the age, if they are also capable of fighting with their all, as fellow followers of the Path of a Warrior.

  <p key="acbb18cd-7452-49f0-bf17-592d307ea83c">
   Despite his honorable and strong belief in the Path of a Warrior, Mifune himself is also not infallible. Mifune seems to previously possess little regard of ordinary human life, having history of being a part of various criminal organizations and crime families. Early on, the reasons for his alliance towards them was unknown and is implied to have led him to being placed on

   After becoming Angela's guardian and bodyguard, however, he abandoned his previous mindset, and seems to have more regard for human life, particularly that of children. He only allows himself to be employed by an organization like
   Arachnophobia
   when they leverage their ability to protect Angela. His belief that there was no chance of co-existence between Witches and ordinary Human interests, caused him to be a firm believer in Arachnohpobia's power to protect Angela, stating that there was "no other way around it", despite Tsubaki's protesting.
  </p>
  <p key="4eefb336-c82f-42cc-8ff3-ebe5b6468401">
   Mifune has a strong love for children, such a trait noted to the point even Tsubaki recommended him being a teacher at DWMA, with him rejecting such idea and claiming it to the "stupidest thing I've ever heard", though was flustered at the idea.
   This love has led him to carry around seaweed flavored candy, despite himself admitting he doesn't eat any sweets, for other children.

   Mifune possesses long, straight, blond hair, blue eyes and a rather muscular build.
   Early on, he wore a overcoat draped over his shoulders as if it were a cape, fluttering behind him while he is in combat. This cape has visible cuts on its end. He then wears a high collar, Japanese-style, button-down shirt dress pants. These pairs of pants contain cuts in their fabric at their hems, Finally, he wears a pair of twine sandals, in addition to being commonly seen with a piece of straw in his mouth which he spits out when he's fighting seriously.
   The color scheme in the anime is that of a white shirt and olive green dress pants as well as his eyes being brown, sandy blond hair, a large brown overcoat.

  <p key="774752e1-5a3e-480e-83f6-363ab35e6ff1">
   Later, the overcoat is a white, with long sleeved white over shirt with with "Osamurai" written on it and a Japanese kanji on the sleeve, with a black undershirt beneath, blue jeans, white belt, and the "Keep out" police line tape running across his shirt.
   He wears the same outfit in the anime. He also dresses to fit the weather, wearing appropiate clothing. In his winter outfit, Mifune wears a winter jacket that looks almost exactly like his new white jacket, but zipped up, and with a pair of cream colored gloves. He also wears a pair of thin ski pants with it, which are blue down to the knees, where they change to pale gray in a diagonal stripe. His sandals are obviously replaced with a pair of snow boots.
