   Carrying himself in an aristocratic manner like his mistress, Mosquito is a neat and formal individual who values proper etiquette, utilizes proper speech, and uses extensive vocabulary compared Giriko's crass and coarse nature.
   As a genuine, firm believer of Arachnopobia's beliefs as well as Arachne, Mosquito himself can be seen even crying out of happiness when things are flowing Arachnophobia's way, and can be motivational to his fellow members.
   Unlike his mistress, he possesses some honorable traits and was willing to let go of
   Team Maka
   when they held their own against him, despite the fact he purposely bid time for them in the Magnetic Field and was impressed with their display.

   Despite this, however, Mosquito is a dark character. As a fierce believer of Arachnophobia, he has also shown himself to not hesitate in killing any enemy of his organisation no matter reagardless of age. He is willing to manipulate extremely skilled men such as
   Mifune
   with those he cares about, like Angela.
   Despite his mostly elegant demeanor, even he has a temper and can extend his anger towards other individuals in front of his mistress, namely Giriko.
   When in battle, he has a tendency to cap his own power and is utterly confident in his power and transformations. While

   , this trait has caused him to suffer humiliating defeats, the manga showcases that this is most likely the byproduct of his incredible power, which even Team Maka has acknowledged.
   When presented in a life-threatening situation, even Mosquito at times can value his own life over lowly members of Arachnophobia.

   Mosquito has a quirk of saying "my boy" or "my girl" during conversation when speaking to those younger then him.
   With his own admission, Mosquito revealed that despite his differences with Giriko, he once held a similar mindset to the chainsaw when he was younger and cited he was a "hot-blooded one back in the day".

He wears a classic wardrobe; consisting of a formal black suit and white shirt, completed with a black bow tie and a relatively large black top hat.

   Mosquito is already present as both

   and
   Arachne
   make their way to
   Baba Yaga Castle
   , having anticipated her revival and bought not only his limosine but also champagne for his mistress, both top of the lines. Despite some complications regarding Giriko and his antics angering Mosquito, Arachne orders Mosquito to take her to the castle on account of her fatigue after being resurrected. Arriving, Mosquito gets teary eyed as he announces the newly instated "network" that him and Arachne have spent 800 years expanding.

   As Arachne's most trusted operative, Mosquito is charged with overseeing the development of the
   Moral Manipulation Machine
   , which is currently nearing its completion within a concealed location. At this distant construction facility; Mosquito receives a detailed description upon the present status of the machine, before proceeding to ask a rather sullen

   to instead become his bodyguard.

   As the battle rages on between intruder and bodyguard, Mosquito warns Mifune that he won't forgive him if he goes it easy, which further elicits an even fiercer round of fighting. At the confrontations conclusion, Mosquito urges Mifune to finish his opponent, threatening that Arachnophobia will no longer provide protection for Angela. However, the issue is never resolved due to the disappearance of Mosquito's entire left arm and torso, as a single shot tears through his body. In desperation, he drains the blood of a fleeing scientist and takes his leave.

   After the destruction of the Moral Manipulation Machine and with Mosquito's apologetic return, Giriko insults him by calling his judgment on the situation of whether their soldiers are fit meaningless, as he himself isn't fit. A small confrontation ensues, where each trades offenses at the other, provoking Mosquito into launching numerous attacks. However; just as Giriko proposes that he take a commemorative photo after cutting Mosquito up into little bits, when Mosquito threatens to go back to his form from 800 years ago, a messenger bursts in. Thus, bringing the battle to a sudden conclusion.

   Mosquito, sent by Arachne, appeared on the "
   Lost Island
   " to locate and take
   Brew
   , before DWMA. While retreating,
   Maka
   and the others meet Mosquito, who claims to have "Brew" in his possession. The group initially assume they have the advantage because of their extended time limit but after Mosquito reverts his body to a stronger
   form from 100 years ago
   , the team is easily overpowered by him. This is until
   Soul
   convinces his companions to leave the task of linking their
   Soul Resonance
   to him. After this power-up, the group manages to deal a crushing defeat to Mosquito and leave him wounded. However; during their period battling, their time on the island had significantly decreased, to such an extent that retreat was the only option. Mosquito comments that he can increase his time by reverting again back to a younger age.

   Knowing they can no longer stay on the island, Mosquito honorably allows them to escape. In the end, DWMA's mission fails. However; it turns out that the "Brew" Mosquito had acquired, had seemingly succumbed to the devastating energies subjected to it due to its location and had ceased to function.

The three of them crash to the ground below, there Mosquito tries to attack Kid but Kid dodges both of his attacks and counterattacks. Free then uses his
   Ice Pillar
   attack to limit Mosquito's movements. Mosquito, realizing the futility of battling them, tries to draw back but is trapped by Free's
   Ice Bind

   Mosquito, still alive, is greatly surprised that Free and Kid both managed to damage him to this degree. So, he transforms once again, into his
   form from 400 years ago
   , healing all his previous injuries. Mosquito, now confident, questions whether or not these two would last more than 4 seconds. Then, within an instant, he cuts both Free in half from the waist and severs Kid's arm in mere moments, before reflecting that they couldn't even last 1 second.
