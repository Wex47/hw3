   with honorifics even after he supposedly betrayed her, addressing Mosquito with the honorifics moments before killing him, and Kid with honorifics before sucking him into The Book of Eibon. Noah also seems to be somewhat conniving, as he ordered the guards of Arachne to leave her during her most crucial moments. Although he states that it was on Arachne's orders, Mosquito regards it as a lie. Kid notes that Noah's soul feels incredibly calm and yet radiates a sense of bottomless terror. Alongside this, Noah appears to be unaffected by madness and compares it to "a gentle breeze".

   with silky black hair. He wears a plaid military cap, with a two metal rings attached to the left side. Alongside his plaid cap is a plaid-colored, long-sleeved, collared shirt that is frequently seen hanging from his waist. Noah also wears a white tank top that is worn beneath an opened black, open-collared jacket. He also wears black pants and shoes. He has two necklaces of different lengths; the longer one has a crystal-like red color and the shorter necklace appears to be similar to a dog tag necklace.Noah appears to have several belts strapped around his upper body, over his white tank top but under his jacket. He has two belts strapped around his right thigh and two strapped around his lower left leg. He has the Book of Eibon strapped to the left of his waist.

   , A mysterious figure who is later identified as "Eibon" questions a lackey of
   Arachnophobia
   on why there's so much noise. The lackey respond by informing the sorcerer that DWMA has infiltrated
   Baba Yaga Castle
   . However, he tells the lackey that Arachne's preparations are reaching it's conclusion.
   Later during Death the Kid's battle with Mosquito in which the Demon Tool "BREW" is used, he senses it's response. As he grimaces from realizing it is close, "Eibon" remarks on how that is "good news".

   Later, as Mosquito arrives from his previous engagement from Death the Kid, he is furious to learn that "Eibon" had ordered the men away from their post in which were suppose to be protecting Arachne. However, "Eibon" claims that the order came from Arachne but Mosquito calls him a liar and questions about his goals while calling him a "shifty excuse for a sorcerer.". Both adversaries prepare to face off against each other as a result, "Eibon" summoning one of his Magic Worms.
   As Death the Kid arrives and spies on their altercation, he spots the shinigami. Mosquito then expresses that he never trusted him from the beginning and regrets trusting the sorcerer and that he would rather finish him, referring to him as "Eibon". However, Mosquito then reveals he was aware that he was an impostor claiming to be Eibon. However, the sorcerer merely noted that he doesn't care how Mosquito would refer to him, stating that with him possessing the Book of Eibon and with his intentions of capturing "BREW", it'll form the "sum of Eibon's wisdom" and that one might say that that the combination of both "BREW" and the Book of Eibon together would make Eibon. He also expresses that he called himself "Eibon" to work under a "well-known brand" and remarked that they're many who are fools for the right brand name. He also compliments the "Eibon" name, saying it has a "ring" to even claims it calls to the mind to collect everything and even surmises that Mosquito came across that "power", referring to "BREW".

   Having seen the

   earlier, he then appears from the corner to Kid and remarks he is something worth collecting, telling him that it is a pleasure to make his aquaintance. He then holds the Book of Eibon over the young shinigami and collects the boy and is amused that he manage to acquire a shinigami and "BREW" at the same time.
