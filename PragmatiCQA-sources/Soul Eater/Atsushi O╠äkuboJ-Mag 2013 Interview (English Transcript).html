   Thank you for taking the time today (to talk to us).
[…]
Was there a certain person, that inspired you to draw manga?

   : I read Akira Toriyamas ‘Dr.Slump' often as a child (you know that work of his before Dragon Ball) till my volumes fell apart (because I read them so often).
Other than that manga I didn’t read all too much other things though.

   : Errr… I have troubles getting up in the morning, that’s why I wanted a job where I could freely arrange my time.

   : How did you got the idea for ‘Soul Eater’?
  </p>
  <p key="4dce4acc-f324-496d-8f22-b22eb05828ab">

   : At this time there were only very little female main characters in Shounen mangas. Or rather I barely know mangas that had one to begin with, so I wanted to create one on my own. Nowadays, Shonen mangas are also popular with girls in Japan, so I made my main character female too.
  </p>
  <p key="42d0b488-81a1-4828-b8d8-c3dbc3075b05">
   Furthermore, Shinigamis are very well known, fantastic creatures, that play important roles, but they never were a main topic, so that’s what I wanted to do. But then, at the same time, titles like Death Note and Bleach were published, with the same idea, so these overlapped somewhat.
  </p>

    Mimiko
   </b>
   : Why did you choose Maka, a female and with that a rather untypical figure as the protagonist for a Shonen manga and what were advantages and disadvantages of this?
  </p>
  <p key="e9e38875-4db8-4955-b284-5fd23d7e5614">
   <b key="e149eefe-cdfb-42a7-8eec-5c1e281a3636">
    Ohkubo
   </b>
   : Like mentioned before, I decided to work with here since there were barely female leads around. One advantage is that she has different ways of solving issues as a girl (than it would be usual for a male Shonen lead).
The battle between her and Crona would’ve been different if both were boys - More aggressive and not solved that gently.
  </p>
  <p key="abc199ee-a8fd-4fa1-b034-8f0c0312453b">
   The disadvantage is that surprisingly many people in Japan think that a Shounen manga needs a male protagonist. Therefore they reject this kind of manga.

   : Why did Excalibur get the appearance in the series you choosed?
  </p>
  <p key="7a1fda34-902c-4c92-92f8-b698953fc17f">
   <b key="64a09d8c-7819-451e-90b6-979bdf9d4d21">
    Ohkubo
   </b>
   : Because I like the works of the artist Edward Gorey. I guess it were his picture books that are the source for this inspiration (for Excaliburs looks).
  </p>
  <p key="7b409454-edce-40a4-b75d-2d81363114f5">
   The concept is of course a bit different, but the fact that he looks like an anteater, comes from my preference for pointy designs. Everything else just kind of happened.

   : I have different ideas but at the moment I want to focus on the end of Soul Eater (which is already planned)  and to keep it clean and reasonable and think about other things afterwards.

    Ohkubo
   </b>
   : Shinigami-sama, Excalibur and Mosquito are my favourites because they are rather easy to draw. (laughs)
Otherwise Black*Stars dialogs are very easy to write because he never discusses more complex topics.

    Ohkubo
   </b>
   : Even though I like manga, I actually don’t read them very often. Especially since I’d have a lack of space in my flat if I’d collect them. Even if I’d only buy magazines it would be pretty cramped.
Right now I read ‘Yotsuba&amp;!' though and always feel very relaxed when I do so.

   : Well, regarding our jobs we don’t motivate one another, but with some of the drawers that I’m good friends with I talk quite often.
  </p>
  <p key="8a9e375c-49a8-409c-8f82-88350c27bb31">
   For example Arakawa-sense,i who did Fullmetal Alchemist, since we were both published in the same (Gangan) magazine. Or Yusuke Kosagi-san who did the character designs for Fire Emblem. We get along well since we are of the same age, but we don’t talk about work.

    Ohkubo

   : I basically listen to everything, but I like nineties music the most because I was a teen then. To name a few… Nirvana, Radiohead, Massive Attack… These are my favourites, as well as many others from oversea.
  </p>
  <p key="d7b7dff0-f35c-4720-8cbb-66b7594d9d8a">
   Oh, because of my mother I also like Led Zeppelin from the seventies (progressive rock) and Jazz and Techno. If it sounds good I’ll listen to it.
