   There is a possibility the Tree Witch is
   Skoya
   , who was also under investigation. However, Skoya's data is categorized alongside Arachne's, who's not on the suspect list, which suggests against it.

   Excalibur's children are the children of
   Excalibur
   and presumably a
   Human
   , as indicated on the family photo. Thus, this makes them a hybrid between that of a
   Mystical Sword
   and that of a Human. However, they were implied to have passed away for unknown reasons. Excalibur described them (along with the woman) as being a great family and showcased actual sadness for a moment, contrasting to his normally selfish and obnoxious personality.
