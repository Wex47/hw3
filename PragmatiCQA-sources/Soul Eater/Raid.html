   Raid is a very opportunistic person, seeking any chance to get what he wants, even going as far as to threaten bodily harm. He is also overconfident, embellishing his own talents despite being unable to fully transform into his weapon form. Due to his pride, Raid is also quick to anger when insulted and lashes out with insults, such as when he called
   Meme
   dumb even though he still wanted her to be his meister.

   Before his defeat, Raid's hair consisted of loose, flowing spikes and bangs with an irregularly long one on the left side of his face. He wore a unbuttoned blue business suit over a white dress shirt along with a red tie and blue slacks held up a black belt. He also wore brown dress shoes. He also wore multiple ear piercings, including two metal hoops on the left ear and a silver ear cuff and a gold stud with a red sphere imbedded within it. Raid almost always had a permanent smirk across his face sporting very thin eyebrows. He retains this appearance

   After his defeat, and a lecture from Anya on better dress for better fighting, Raid followed his meister's example and stopped wearing his hair long and removed all ear piercings. Although still blonde and still with piercing blue eyes, his smirk is replaced with a more polite smile. His hair is cut shorter and his bangs are swept away from his eyes, although still asymmetrical. He no longer wears his business suit, instead sticking to his dress shirt (with the sleeves now rolled up), tie, slacks, and shoes. His change in hair and attire also may be influenced by the summer heat.

   Raid was one of the new students of Shibusen and came along with Hao late to class. After finishing the day's lesson, their teacher
   Sid Barrett
   dismissed them and all other students. Sid also warned late students to arrive to the next class on time.

   After leaving class, Hao asked Raid what he wanted for a partner. Raid replied that he would rather have a cute, female meister rather than spend time in the boys' dorm. Noticing
   Meme Tatane
   and assuming she was not bright, Raid attempted to flirt with her to become his meister.
   Tsugumi Harudori
   , eavesdropping on this conversation, was noticed by Hao, whose comments intimidated Tsugumi to run away in fear. However, when Meme did not accept Raid as her weapon Tsugumi returned and took Meme's hand to escape these bullies. Hao stopped the two NOT students, as Raid claimed the two boys were only looking for partners. Noticing this confrontation, Anya stood up for Tsugumi and Meme, openly insulting Hao and Reid to their faces.

   Raid challenges Anya to a duel, who accepts, asking Tsugumi to turn into a weapon. Raid turned into his weapon form, a sword, but he was unable to transform his head. While Tsugumi had difficulties transforming, inspiring words from Sid, who was observing the duel, and memories of
   Maka Albarn
   's encouraging words, allowed Tsugumi to finally transform into a
   halberd
   . Anya and Tsugumi swiftly defeat Hao and Raid, whose injuries prompt
   Clay Sizemore
   to find

   Before they are taken to the infirmary for medical treatment, Raid transformed back into his human form, with Anya standing above him and Hao. She demanded the two punks stand up, as she lectured the two that their failure was because they focus more on physical appearance than skills at combat: she demanded the two remove their jewelry and cut their hair so they could move more easily and see better in combat. When Raid commented that girls are interested in cool, flashy guys, Anya informs the two that girls prefer people who can face themselves, who can "be cool without acting." This information impresses Hao and Raid, who agree to follow "Anya-sama's" lesson.

   Anya then took Hao and Raid through the DWMA to observe EAT student
   Ox Ford
   , who studies and physical training are for the sake of
   someone he loves
   . When Hao and Raid then see Ox's work still fails to impress Kim, who thinks Ox's haircut makes him look creepy, the two students are shocked at Anya, who had told them earlier that girls care less about flashy appearances and more about substance. Anya responds, "Everything has its limits."

   In the summer, Hao and Raid return to NOT classes at the DWMA. During

   in attendance, Hao is the first student called forward to demonstrate Raid's ability at fully transforming into a weapon. They are gently mocked by
   Anya Hepburn
   , who is curious to know whether the two have learned anything since their duel on the first day at classes. While Raid is able to transform more of his head than before, he cannot transform above his jaw. Maka and Soul explain that the two must improve their ability at
   Soul Resonance
   in order to improve their abilities.
   Although their transformation was insufficient,
   Tsugumi Harudori
   is impressed with Hao and Raid's persistence to train more to improve their Soul Resonance, especially compared to how she remembers their prior behavior.
