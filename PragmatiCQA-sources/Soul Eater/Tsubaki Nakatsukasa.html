   , and is very patient and forgiving. She has a very magnanimous, polite and gentle personality and always tries to help or comfort her friends even when she has no idea how to help. She is caring and understanding and sometimes acts as the mediator when her friends fight, and her understanding and insight sometimes makes her the agony aunt figure for people who are troubled. She cares deeply for her friends, and does not seem fond of things that might make them upset, even going so far as to suggest to

   to nullify the dare Maka has to do after she loses the basketball game, due to not knowing the rules. She often worries about her friends if they are in danger, and is upset when the people she cares about are hurt. She also has a talent for cooking, and doesn't seem to mind cooking even for big-eaters like Black☆Star and

  <p key="5ebeac63-ab61-469f-a7e1-3dc51f419b81">
   She is also generous and kindhearted, up until the point that some people even take advantage of her. She also has a habit of apologizing, even when it isn't her own fault (something which she often does when Black☆Star does something wrong in front of people). One of the most mature and flexible characters, Tsubaki is very amicable and gets along well with her peers and can be very understanding of their feelings.

   , even though he had joined Arachnophobia). She deeply cares for her friends and prefers to avoid unnecessary conflict, usually being the one who diffuses any arguments between people, making her a dependable and trustworthy friend. Her patience often makes her the only calm one (apart from perhaps, Soul) in situations when everyone else has lost their temper.
  </p>
  <p key="bb8bb9e3-0298-45ce-9c5b-5ef37fbf4b34">

    Masamune
   </a>
   , accuse her generosity and capacity by calling her a pushover, saying that she does not have the ability to show her true feelings or deny something that she thinks is not true. As a child, Tsubaki had a habit of pretending that she liked certain things in order to please others, such as when she told Masamune that she wanted to play ball when she really wanted to play house. She does suffer from low self-esteem at the start of the series, comparing herself to the camellia flower, a 'flower without a fragrance, blooming silently and looking tragic when its petals scatter.' She can also be a little submissive and reluctant to be direct.
  </p>
  <p key="79a52fbd-4d79-4b4b-b74b-9de01f0b1674">
   However, her confrontation with Masamune allows her to mature and be more confident with herself, and she denies that she is a flower without a fragrance, and proves it to her brother by defeating him. She learns to be more honest with herself as the series goes on. When the situation calls for it, she will put her foot down, and can be as determined and as stubborn as Black☆Star himself. She refuses to use the

   when she thinks Black☆Star is too injured to keep on fighting, and also shouts at Maka and Soul to stop them from fighting with each other during the battle against Free, showing that she has grown more assertive. She still can be easily embarrassed, and can sometimes be paranoid and takes things too literally, and her reaction when Maka sarcastically suggests that Black☆Star and Soul be partners since they seem to be such close friends.

   Tsubaki is a tall, well-endowed young girl of Japanese descent of around sixteen or seventeen years old.
  </p>
  <p key="76af7844-1943-4db7-b6aa-1c929ea63ac9">
   She wears a pale yellow, sleeveless outfit with a skirt end that has a slit down the side with a bright yellow star emblazoned on the right side of the chest. She also wears a dark brown scarf and a tight dark brown stocking on her right leg starting just above the knee and white boots. She wears a sash that looks similar to Black☆Star's grey riveted straps that wraps around her waist twice and hangs down diagonally from right to left. She has long black hair tied up in a ponytail and large indigo eyes. Occasionally, like when she is bathing or playing basketball, her ponytail and the strands of hair at the side of her face are tied up into 'loops.' Upon using the Uncanny Sword, her hair is loose, with tattoos that are the same pattern as Black☆Star's. She wears grey and black bandages on her arms from the shoulder down, and wears a sweatband with a star symbol on it on each of her wrists.
  </p>
  <p key="223fba01-2bb4-4886-b587-26852c9ea597">
   Upon joining Spartoi, Tsubaki's attire has changed completely. Like Black☆Star, she now wears a sleeveless white top with stitches going down the middle and a black scarf around her neck. She now wears blue shorts tied with a black belt, with a small pouch attached marked with a star symbol. Like Black☆Star, she wears white bandages on her arms below her shoulders, although some black bandages can be seen near her shoulders too. On her right leg, she has a long plain back stocking, whilst on her left, she has several black bands wound around her leg. Her shoes are also black, unlike the rest of the Spartoi members, who wear white shoes.

   , she has a very masculine build, tall and muscular, resembling her older brother Masamune. She is dressed in a black Japanese-like tunic and has bandages on her arms like Black☆Star. Her bangs are spikier although her ponytail still remains, but it is tied lower down her head unlike in her original female form, similar in the manner of her father and Masamune.

Maka and Soul proceed to attack, but Stein manages to disarm Maka and prepares to start dissecting her. However, Black Star manages to get him to let go by using his Certain Kill: Black☆Star Big Wave. But he is surprised as the attack does no effect to him. Stein explains that as he had seen Black Star's soul and Soul Wavelength, he had been able to change his own Wavelength to match Black Star's, therefore Resonating with him and making Black Star's Wavelength attack useless. He then attacks Black Star with his own Wavelength, which causes him to lose consciousness in a pool of blood. While Tsubaki in tears and is horrified, Sid tells her when he was alive, he was not the kind of man who would run away, but he tells Tsubaki she should not continue a fight if she cannot win.

Soul protests that he had still killed Black Star, but the Meister then regains consciousness, being tended to by Tsubaki.

When Tsubaki asks what had happened to them now, Black Star replies that they were all killed by DWMA thirteen years ago, and he, who had still been an infant at the time, was taken into DWMA. Tsubaki asks if he holds any grudges against the DMWA, but Black Star says no, in that his father and mother paid for their crimes and that is that.

Kid stops the fight and to Black Star's shock, walks through Free, proving that the Free standing before them is nothing more than a hologram produced through Free's magic.

However, he tries to keep on fighting, but Asura, with a mere swipe of the hand, defeats him in one blow. He then defeats Kid in the same way, before escaping to the surface.

Due to a shortage of one player (Liz) they force Maka into joining the game. Black Star even lets her be captain of his team, even though he obviously shows signs that he wants to be the captain. Soul brings up the idea of a bet, for each of the teams' respective captain to follow if they lose. If Kid's team loses, they will put the paintings on Kid's walls in his mansion off by 2 cm; if Maka's team loses, she has to go shopping with her father. Ultimately, Kid's team wins, and Maka has to go shopping with her father, much to the joy of Soul, Black Star and Patty, although Tsubaki, feeling sorry for Maka, tries to persuade them to nullify the bet.

Mosquito then uses his immense strength to overpower the kids. Luckily, Soul comes up with the idea of Chain Resonance and augmenting it with his music. The group laugh as they hear he is going to play the piano in his soul. When Soul asks why they are laughing, Maka replies that they had finally got Soul to play the piano for them.

  <p key="865cc39c-96da-4176-bf9b-408f1ba913e8">
   Soul plays the piano, giving everyone a rush of power, enabling them to maneuver flawlessly around each other and link their attacks with ease. They are easily able to overcome Mosquito with both their speed and strength. Black Star activates the Uncanny Sword, being able to Resonate better with it due to Soul's piano, and performs

Kid then manages to connect a Death Cannon, which destroys both of Mosquito's arms. Before they can finish him off, Soul stops playing, advising them to leave as their time limit for staying in the vortex is almost up. Black Star angrily says that he is still going to fight, but he shows signs of fatigue after using the Uncanny Sword. Tsubaki suggests that he leave, and he eventually agrees. Since Mosquito can revert to an even younger form of himself, he can remain in the vortex for longer, and the group have no choice but to retreat without Brew.

They leave and watch how the Witch's research facility is destroyed by an explosion, though that, too, is a hologram from years past. When they exit the vortex they are greeted by a distraught Marie, who makes a move to strike them, but instead hugs them all for making it out safe, but soon threatens that they will all have a talking with her back at DWMA.

Meanwhile, Tsubaki contacts Shinigami. She apologizes for not being able to help them with invading Arachnophobia's castle yet, and tells them on how she and Black Star are getting on.

Black Star tells her that as a member of the Star Clan, he is always in darkness. However, he describes Tsubaki as the bright stars whilst he is the dark sky. Tsubaki teases him, saying that he is not like himself, and Black Star, embarrassed, tells her that he just wants to thank her.

The Will remarks that Black Star is trembling, and the Meister is in tears. However, he claims that these tears are not his own but of the ones who failed to master the ways of the warrior. He tells the deer that he does not want to lose, and proceeds to say that he will take on the burden of the regret of the ones who had fallen. He tells the deer that the path he walks is not the 'Path of a Demon' but the 'Path of a Warrior' who revives the dead.

   Black Star and Tsubaki arrives first in front of Sid's troops some distance away from Baba Yaga's Castle. However, he soon goes against orders and crashes through the forest, breaking through all of the castle's security and entering the castle's grounds, making a grand entrance. He is approached by three hundred soldiers of Arachnophobia's samurai division. Black Star prepares to attack, but Mifune jumps into the fray and tells everyone that he will fight Black Star alone.
  </p>
  <p key="ef9073c4-f608-40d0-a0ca-3111e4ad7357">
   Mifune sees that Black Star has changed. Black Star replies that his soul is now clear of indecision, and that he will overcome Mifune as he had been standing on the path that he had chosen to follow. The two agree that this is their last battle. With their newly achieved power over their Uncanny Sword, Black Star and Tsubaki perform Soul Resonance and activate a new Uncanny Sword form--
   Shadow☆Star: First Form - Chain of Blackness
   . With this new power Black Star is able to easily match Mifune's strength. After a while, Mifune performs his

   . He then starts to beat Black Star with his moves such as
   Sword Fang
   . Seeing that the Chain of Blackness will not work against Mifune, Black Star changes it into a new form,
   Shadow☆Star: Third Form - Severed Shadow
   . This drastically improves Black Star's speed and allowed him to give Mifune several blows. However, Mifune is able to find a gap in his defenses, but Black Star manages to counter this by making Tsubaki turn into a replica of himself, engaging in
   Shadow☆Star: Fourth Form - Branched Darkness
   and performing
   Planet Destruction Cannon
   .
  </p>
  <p key="b526b038-cc9a-4735-be81-ff490ce623e4">
   The two still continue fighting, with Black Star using Severed Shadow again. However, Mifune manages to wound him using his
   Disorderly Line
   . Mifune asks Black Star why he is hesitating, and that he himself has now nothing to lose. Black Star retorts that he has no hesitation, and he engages in his most powerful form,
   Shadow☆Star: Zeroth Form - Masamune
   . He tells Mifune that he is ready to die following the 'Path of a Warrior.' Mifune asks him if he is ready to take on another responsibility as well. If he does not have nothing to lose, he will not be able to defeat him. The two continue fighting, and although Black Star manages to wound Mifune, he himself gets grievously injured, with Mifune also breaking two of his fingers after the two lock swords. Mifune tells Black Star that he is not the only one who is prepared to die on the 'Path of a Warrior.' He asks if he is going to undermine his name as a warrior by showing indecisiveness to kill him. The Will of Nakatsukasa explains to Black Star that following the 'Path of a Warrior' means bearing misfortune and sadness onto others as well. Black Star replies by having Tsubaki make the Uncanny Sword the weight of a normal katana. She reluctantly complies. He thanks her and proceeds for the last move.
  </p>
  <p key="47508ab2-737e-4353-8415-5855c7d711d4">
   Mifune abandons all of his swords, save one, and the two clash, wounding each other with many strikes. During the last moments of the battle, Mifune makes a large cut through Black Star's right shoulder and arm, splitting Black Star's tattoo in half with a large scar. Black Star, unfazed by this, uses the opportunity to stab Mifune on his left side—most likely through his heart.
  </p>
  <p key="a81da1e4-a24c-45ca-b8bf-33beed68da64">
   The last attack by Black Star is enough to conclude the battle and ultimately end Mifune's life. As he proceeds to collapse, Mifune catches him and gently lays him down, congratulating him. Apologizing to Angela, he proceeds to collapse, but Tsubaki returns to her human form to help him up. Mifune tells her to bring him closer to the castle as much as she can, and she obeys, crying. She and Black Star watch as Mifune's soul is scattered into the wind.

   Tsubaki soon starts crying for Black Star, worried of his injuries. Nygus attends to Black Star and Sid tells her that he will be all right, but then, Arachne starts spreading madness across the land, causing everyone, Tsubaki included, to start falling into madness. Black Star, however, is the only one in his area unaffected. Despite his wounds, he manages to stand up and 'blow' the madness away from his area and tell the others to strengthen their minds.

   Black Star is sauntering through the hall with Tsubaki, declaring his arrival. Once they reach the door to the Death Room, Tsubaki notes that there is a sign telling them not to enter. This does not stop Black Star, though, as he kicks the door down while commenting that he can pass through any door.

The Table of Contents explains that Death the Kid is in the seventh Chapter of the book, and to reach him, they would have to traverse through all seven Chapters in the book, with each one having its own dangers. Everyone says that they will go and save Kid, no matter what.

   The Table of Contents acknowledges their determination and sends them on to the first Chapter, Lust, where everyone has their genders switched, taking on the form of their idea of a perfect sexual partner. Black Star is transformed into a girl, who is well-endowed, which he does not hesitate to declare. He also adopts a female-like personality. As
   the Succubus
   appears, the 'male' members of the team (who are originally female) begin to be allured by the creature's sexual appeal. Black Star, now having the personality of a clingy attention-seeking young girl, clings to the male Tsubaki and asks her if she is not aroused, even with someone as great as him around. He rubs his chest against Tsubaki's shoulder, much to Tsubaki's embarrassment. Blair defeats the Succubus by making it fall for her in her male form, and the magic cat uses the opportunity to blast the creature away using her

   As the team continue on to the next Chapter, Gluttony, everyone realizes that even though they had left the Lust Chapter, they are still in their opposite genders, although their personalities have returned to normal. The Table of Contents explains that they will change back to their original form after leaving the Lust Chapter, and that the speed of the transformation depends on the individual's sexual desire: the stronger the desire, the slower the transformation. Tsubaki is horrified, saying that it will be embarrassing for the last person to change. Kirikou, however, finds this quite amusing, which Tsubaki furiously denies. She grows paranoid, wondering on what to do if she was the last one to change.

   Black Star and Patty begin to help themselves to the platters of food laid out in the Chapter, and the team are confronted by a monstrous

   that is about to eat them. The team prepare to fight. Black Star comments that Tsubaki's Weapon form feels slightly different in male form. After the pig states that its own flesh is of exceptional quality, Black Star, along with Kirikou and Patty, decide to eat the pig instead. Black Star slices off one of the pig's arms, and Kirikou fries it with Pot of Thunder, before taking a bite out of the roast meat. Black Star slices up the rest of the pig, and Kirikou fries the pieces again. He gorges on the meat alongside Kirikou and Patty. Before they can get drawn further into the sin of Gluttony, Soul has The Table of Contents move onto the next Chapter.

   Maka and Soul now get separated from the group and end up one Chapter behind. The rest of the group move on, and are next seen in the fourth Chapter, Wrath. Suffused with the color red, and wrought with lava, the area influences them and places them in an enraged and easily irritable mood. The chapter ends up aggravating everyone, making them all fly into a rage. Since Tsubaki is still in her male form whilst everyone from her and Liz have changed back, Black Star furiously calls her a pervert for no reason, and even Tsubaki ends up losing her temper (albeit briefly). However, everyone manages to calm down a little.

Liz laments over her mistake, as Black Star and the others stare on, not really concerned about the mistake.

   In the last Chapter of Greed, Tsubaki and Liz slowly start changing back into their female forms, and Liz transforms just a bit faster than Tsubaki, making her the most lustful out of the group. Everyone teases her, much to her annoyance. Blair points out that both of them are still incredibly lustful. Liz wonders if Blair is still male, and Tsubaki vehemently replies that she definitely still is.

   After reaching the end of Greed, everyone asks The Table of Contents to take them to where Kid is. The Table of Contents answers that he can only take them this far. The rest, is up to them. He asks them what they are searching for and Black Star responds with 'Power- to fight my enemies, to protect my friends, and to save Kid.' A portal is then opened for him and only him to go. Everyone senses madness coming from the portal. Everyone worries for Black Star, reassures them that he will bring Kid back, Pattyng Tsubaki on the head before jumping into the portal. Whilst waiting for Black Star, Liz remembers on how she and Patty met Kid, and cries, saying that she had not been able to thank Kid yet for all he had done for them. Tsubaki and Patty both hug her.
