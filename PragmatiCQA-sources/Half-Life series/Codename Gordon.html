   began in mid-2003. The game was started as a fan project by Paul "X-Tender" Kamma, who was responsible for the software coding. Soenke "Warbeast" Seidel, was responsible for the game's graphics. Kamma and Seidel both have extensive experience with Flash, so they used it to create the game. The initial intention was to create a platformer game, the setting was decided upon after seeing several pre-release advertisements for Valve's

   was supposed to receive several updates, including a second bonus game which would be unlocked after finishing the game. However, Paul Kamma announced that the update was canceled. The game is no longer available on the Steam store, due to Nuclearvision Entertainment's collapse, which leads to the official company's site' removal. As the access to the site is hardcoded into the game, Valve was forced to remove it from the Steam catalog. However, its depot hasn't been removed from content servers so the game is downloadable using protocol commands or command line parameters.

   The game received much attention from the community, even before its release to the public. As noted by Tim Bruns, the art director of Nuclearvision, the game attracted over 600,000 players in the first three weeks of its release. Bruns revealed that he was surprised by this number, and said that "the ability to reach this many gamers almost overnight is amazing".

   has received overall good reviews from game critics. Home of the Underdogs described it as being "one of the best fangames". The game has also been widely appreciated for its inclusion of the gravity gun, with Gameplanet saying that it "works as advertised, and is indeed, pretty [cool]". Pixel Rage also described the weapon as one of the game's best features, and gotoAndPlay said it "adds a nice touch to the game". Codename: Gordon has also been praised for its detailed background landscapes, as well as its unique dialog style, in which the player uses emoticons to communicate with other characters.

  <p key="215340cc-7593-4713-9c67-1510a49c1cc8">
   However, the game has received some negative feedback as well. One of the main issues that have been raised is performance, with gotoAndPlay stating that the game has a tendency towards lower frame frequencies when multiple enemies are present on the screen, as well as a lack of proper optimization. Home of the Underdogs also complained about the game's high system requirements, considering its complexity, a 1.6 GHz processor or higher being necessary in order to play. The game has also been criticized for its lack of opponent variety and its simple yet awkward control scheme, and its lack of a save function.
