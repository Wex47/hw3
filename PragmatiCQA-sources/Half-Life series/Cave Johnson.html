   Cave's father was a farming professor at the institute of farming although he never farmed a day in his life.
   In his youth, Cave Johnson became a successful business entrepreneur. Having his father's theories as the backbone, in
   1943
   he founded Aperture Fixtures, a shower curtain developer and manufacturer. Much of Johnson's early success came from Aperture Fixtures, and with the company developing high-tech shower curtains for most branches of the United States military as well as the public,
   Johnson soon became a billionaire. Making use of his new wealth, in
   1944
   Johnson purchased a huge salt mine in Upper Michigan, whose tunnels extended over four kilometers below the surface. The main Aperture Fixtures facility was constructed within the underground caverns.
  </p>
  <p key="fbd73b03-bb44-4fda-8e17-696abf248f8c">
   In
   1947
   Johnson renamed the company "Aperture Science" and began to focus on experimental physics as a new direction for the company. Although Johnson was well known for his unorthodox approach to science, Aperture Science received an award for Best New Science Company in 1947.

   By the
   1960s
   , Aperture's financial boom period had passed, and with countless products stuck in the testing phase, as well as many being pulled from shelves for violating health and safety regulations, Aperture was beginning to struggle. In
   1961
   , Johnson ordered the lower areas of Test Shaft 09 to be sealed off to hide the highly unethical experiments Aperture had been conducting. In
   1968
   , Aperture Science was involved in U.S. Senate hearings regarding astronauts going missing after their participation in testing.
  </p>
  <p key="277adea1-1fa3-46d9-9f34-4d4d5b8a9325">
   Later in 1968, Aperture was declared bankrupt. As a result, the company could no longer afford to hire astronauts and soldiers for testing, and instead resorted to collecting homeless people from the street. These 'subjects' were offered $60 for their services, and an additional $60 if the 'subjects' would allow themselves to be disassembled and then reassembled in the name of science. Johnson was quite bitter about Aperture's bankruptcy, and did not attempt to hide his dislike for the homeless people he was forced to hire. Johnson blamed

  <p key="d6e61d2b-5edb-42c7-9ab0-edfa7cf9d9da">
   By October 1976, Johnson had Aperture branch out in its selection of "low risk" test subjects to include orphans, psychiatric patients, and the elderly.

  <p key="740d0a6a-c924-40f3-8268-04ddc7241f1c">
   In response to Aperture's continued struggle for test subjects amidst financial turmoil, Johnson made testing mandatory for all employees. He stated that this dramatically raised the quality of test subjects, but dramatically reduced employee retention. As such, he finally moved to phase out human testing.
  </p>
  <p key="ecae1d9f-8f11-40d7-a952-33d27a3b80ef">
   During this time, Johnson continued to make pre-recorded messages over the intercom system, however few were on the subject of testing, and instead addressed employees about the future of the company, with also many having Johnson raging over his imminent demise. Desperate to cheat death, in
   1982
   Johnson ordered his engineers and technicians to begin research and development on a computer system (AI) that could store his consciousness. Should the system be completed after his death, Johnson ordered that his ever loyal assistant Caroline succeed him as CEO of Aperture.
   Johnson died before the system was finished, and eventually Caroline was uploaded into the system and transformed into

The initial messages are intended for "astronauts, war heroes, and Olympians", indicating a time of prosperity for the company where the greatest members of society were used during testing. The messages show a steady decline in Johnson's sanity, and consequently the prosperity of his company. His 1970s era recordings state that Aperture was a major participant in the 1968 Senate hearings relating to some matter involving missing astronauts, and that Aperture has gone bankrupt. Johnson blames Aperture's bankruptcy on Black Mesa, claiming that they have stolen ideas that Aperture has invented. Aperture's economic troubles also show in announcements directed at test subjects, as the subjects are normally hobos who were picked off the street and offered up to $120 for testing ($60 for testing, $60 more if they allowed Aperture to disassemble and then reassemble them). In the 1980s  recordings, Cave states that employees are required to test.

   In an alternate universe, Aperture scientists were able to create a robot body for Johnson before his passing. However, the body's head was too small to fit his brain, so they kept building it bigger and bigger until he became a giant head with the robot body crushed underneath. Johnson proceeded to kill some of the scientists and threatened to kill the rest if they came back before locking himself in his office at the top of Aperture Science. In the events of the game,
   Grady
   and
   the player
   arrange a meeting (break into his office) to show off their new invention (a toilet turret) and discover the giant head, who asks that they kill him to end his suffering. They oblige, first by using the turret to try to destroy it, before finally shutting off its power source. Unfortunately, the facility's backup power turns him back on immediately, prompting him to fire Grady and the player. Before this can be made official, however, the damage to the room causes Johnson's head to crash through the floor, plummeting to the bottom of the facility. Now stuck with the discarded remains of several toilet turrets, Johnson sings a short operatic requiem with them.

   Cave Johnson was an eccentric but highly motivated man. He is said to have learned to "trust his gut," and to think in terms of "the big picture" without regard for details. He apparently had a poor personal understanding of science, but he understood people. He was very dismissive whenever someone tried to tell him something that objected to his views, often ignoring it and firing the person on the spot for it.
  </p>
  <p key="fed0fbf9-1a97-4def-94ff-e51d529256c1">
   Johnson was extroverted, enthusiastic, and opinionated. He seems to have been very energetic, perhaps even impulsive, and considered his life an adventure he was happy to be on. He was born a salesman, a leader. People trusted him, even when his plans were clearly dangerous. He used his warm, homespun delivery to put people at ease. However, he appeared to be spoiled and refused to oblige to others' instructions. He was not particularly ethical, and he did not seem to accept the responsibility that came with his power: Many of his company's initiatives were dangerous and ill-conceived, but he was evidently unconcerned or oblivious to their ramifications.
  </p>
  <p key="d8d4cc57-b058-4e1c-bb33-f8ea4c4b1f23">
   The results of the
   Aperture Science Collaborative Disposition Test
   tell that Johnson does not see crises - only challenging opportunities ("challengitunities") he chooses to scale like mountains, that he is a can-do, shoot-from-the-hip, silver-tongued self-starter, and a good match for any cooperative test partner, providing they shut up and listen.

    memos
    seemingly written by Cave Johnson can be found. In one, he describes the three pillars on which Aperture Science is built. In another, he addresses Test Subjects who raised their concerns about the dangers of the research conducted by Aperture Science. Another consists of a rant about casualty rates, firing employees, and him practicing beekeeping in his office. In another, reusing text from the casting call sheet revealed in 2008, he apparently announces his death, and being able to write memos from beyond the grave. One is apparently the answer to a confidential letter Johnson sent, titled "Human Enrichment &amp; Testing Initiative, Resource Acquisitions". It apparently describes the four types of Test Subjects and their behavior, referring to them in a less than human way.
