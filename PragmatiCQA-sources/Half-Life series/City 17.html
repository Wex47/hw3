   The core of the city consists predominately of wall-to-wall buildings, with blocks of clustered low-rises made out of a variety of old and new buildings. Under Combine rule, certain residential buildings in the city are used as accommodations for citizens.
   Conditions in such housings are typically seen as poor, with very few luxuries and constant inspection and raids by

   However, some city infrastructure, such as power plants, are maintained by the Combine, and electricity is made widely available from both traditional sources and Combine generators.
   The Combine themselves occupied some former government buildings, such as the

   City 17's transportation system had considerable variety. In addition to highways and city streets, City 17 includes underground road tunnels that traveled beneath the city; during the Resistance uprising against the Combine, portions of the tunnels could be seen, badly damaged, with areas flooded with toxic substances.

   The presence of unused tramways on a street also suggest that the city once provided tram services before the Combine rule.

   A network of canals is also prevalent in and around City 17.
   Much of the inner city canals, however, were made defunct after the Combine's draining of large bodies of water around City 17 left much of the area's canal system dry.
   However, the industrial district canal systems remains usable, albeit shallower, with certain portions of the canals contaminated with
   hazardous materials

   , although it is possible to limit the location somewhat. For example, City 17's country is almost certainly one that uses the
   Cyrillic alphabet
   , which is often seen in the game; since, whereas the Latin alphabet is commonly seen in Cyrillic-using countries, the reverse is much rarer. Secondly, City 17's country borders the sea. And in fact, there are only three countries that both use Cyrillic and are not landlocked:
