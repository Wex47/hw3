   The Combine Guard was to wield a large weapon, the

   , that was to fire a powerful disintegration beam, recycled for the

   Its camera was going to shoot a laser but was cut due to the fact the Combine Guard already had two weapons. With the camera attachment being the real head of the soldier (according to its texture file, named "head.vtf"), it is likely that the man inside the robotic suit was to be blind, his eyes seeming to have been somehow removed. It would have made it a disturbing sight for humans, who would tend to look at its human face and be unaware of the direction its real "head" is actually looking at. A breather is also in the human mouth, implying it is breathing the ambient air, filtered, and still uses some form of lungs.

   ", it was also to be able to burst doors. At the "end" of the map, the player was to find themself behind a door. The Combine Guard would appear behind it, destroy the small window with the small weapon attached on its left wrist, look through it with its camera, then knock the door down with its fists, the player will then have to open one of the two doors behind them and escape from the blast of the
   Combine Guard Gun

   After it was knocked down more props or explosives could be used to break off and damage its armor bit by bit.  Once its armour is sufficiently damaged, it would be disabled completely but not killed. Damaging it again would kill it but doing so will crash the game.The head could have been shot killing the guard but isn't used in the beta. After the Guard fires his beam Plasma Fire was suppose to spawn but isn't used.

   If the player was to go behind the metal barricade (in e3_terminal) the

   the combine guard would react to the player but wouldn't attack. The combine guard will bleed only if shot in the head but it will do no damage.

    There are vents in the back of the Combine Guard meaning if the Combine Guard was hit with many explosives the guard would have started to smoke or catch on fire at one point.

    It is heavily implied that the Combine Guard was going to be a boss at one point during development as there are some left overs. At one point the guard was to be killed by getting shot in the facial area though doesn't appear in the leak because if the player shoots the armor with bullets it will do absolutely nothing but if he fires any weapon that isn't a explosive at the transhuman's facial area green blood effects will appear when shot though still doing no damage. The only way to kill it is to use the Gravity Gun to through certain objects to kill it. At one point during development it was to be destroyed by using explosives as there were vents in the back of the guard meaning it was to start smoking or catch on fire once enough explosives were to damage the armor. Its also implied that when the guard dies there is no ragdoll (at the moment) as the guard will disappear with little parts falling off him. It was rumored that at one point the player could have shot the camera making the guard blind and unable to see which isn't or hasn't been implemented yet.
