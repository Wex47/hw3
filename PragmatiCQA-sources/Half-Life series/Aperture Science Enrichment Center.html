It begins to ascend, however, and before Wheatley can stop it, the two find themselves facing a reactivated GLaDOS, who sits in ruin in the remains of her chamber. GLaDOS, bitter towards Chell, forces her to resume her tests with the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device as revenge for her murder at Chell's hands. At the same time, GLaDOS begins rebuilding the facility, restoring it to nearly pristine condition by the time Chell can break free of the Test Chambers.

   Following a Core Transfer with Wheatley, GLaDOS is transferred into a potato-powered chip or battery with only enough processing power for the simplest of functions, while Wheatley takes control of the facility in her place. Wheatley quickly becomes power-mad, renaming the facility "Wheatley Laboratories" and driving both Chell and GLaDOS deep underground. In the meantime, Wheatley sets about producing freakish mishmashes of objects and poorly-built Test Chambers, destroying vast chunks of the facility and causing the main reactor to begin melting down out of negligence. GLaDOS and Chell defeat Wheatley and restore a somewhat reformed GLaDOS to power, who rebuilds the facility again and releases Chell to the surface, having finished her robotic replacements and grown weary of trying to kill her.

Within the cavernous shafts is a large abundance of space that remains unused by Aperture, and installations are often suspended above huge drops that extend deep into the mines.
Between the Enrichment Center and the Test Shafts is a large hatch that, when open, allows an elevator to connect the original facility to the modern one. The Mobility Gel pipe system also flows through this connecting hatch. The modern facility is supported by a vast array of large springs, likely a network of seismic isolators, to prevent sensitive research equipment from being affected by the instability of the mineshafts below.

   At the start of each Test Chamber is a large rectangular luminous panel that lights itself when the Test Subject approaches, accompanied by a loud hum. The number of the current Test Chamber covers the whole upper half of the panel; under is the current test's completion bar, with the current chamber number against that of the final one, and the proper completion bar below, getting longer as each Test Chamber is completed (it is made of 76 lines; each Test Chamber starts with 4 more lines - Test Chamber 01 starts with 4 lines; Test Chamber 00 starts with the 76 lines, reached again at the start of Test Chamber 19). Under the bar are two rows of five of squares, each containing a logo of what the Test Subject is expected to see in the following chamber. The panel ends with a standard Aperture Laboratories logo at the very bottom.

   A notable feature among the Test Chambers is the stark atmosphere. All of the walls and floors are a plain gray, and the overall feeling is one of a clinic or clean room. This motif continues until

   The original Enrichment Center was constructed at the very bottom of the same salt mine the modern facility was in and built steadily upwards over time. These chambers, containing the Repulsion, Propulsion, and Conversion Gels, were sealed away decades prior, yet they often show far less damage than the ruined facility above. For the most part, some broken catwalks aside, all of the furniture and technology in the abandoned facilities seems to at least appear in good shape, including the prerecorded voice of Cave Johnson. Said chambers were built in enormous geodesic domes and spheres (made from asbestos), stacked on top of one another with markings along the sides of structures to indicate the year they were built. The abandoned Test Chambers are unsealed and cleared by Chell in her efforts to return to the surface - in the process, their Gels become available for use in the upper facility.

   The higher one ascends through the test chambers (and therefore - progressing through more recently built chambers), the lower quality the test chambers and their monitoring areas seem to be. In addition to this, the quality of the test subject diminished over the years as well. While at first astronauts and Olympic champions were hired as test subjects, they were soon replaced by simple hobos picked up from the street and, eventually, the very employees who are supposed to monitor the tests. Both of these facts suggest that Aperture Science was running out of budget fairly quickly. This is also confirmed in the Development Commentary.

  <p key="2b61f62f-fa9d-46c8-9af1-61e687231b1d">
   A slightly more minor difference in the progression of chamber levels is the logo of Aperture Science shown during loading screens. When the game begins, it shows a decayed Aperture Laboratories logo as seen in the elevators of

   . Soon after GLaDOS is powered back up, the logo is cleaned. However, once

   </a>
   forces Chell down into the depths of the facility, the logo becomes the one used by the original Aperture Science Innovators, styled in a late '40s fashion. In addition the offices now have a mid-century theme to their design. Progressing through the sealed chambers into the section dated from the 70's shows a logo with the "Science Innovators" dropped to become just "Aperture." Advancing further into the 80's Test Chambers reveals a new logo, somewhat reminiscent of computer startup screens from the early 90's accompanied by offices with the look of the same era. Once Chell returns to the modern facility, the "Aperture" in the modern logo is crudely replaced with "Wheatley", and faintly tinted orange.

The offices contain chairs and computers and seem to have been last used long ago.

Two office areas contain a projection room where a looping slideshow titled "
