   In firefight, when a guard sees an enemy, he will pull out his Glock 17 out of his holster and will shoot the target constantly until they are dead. If the enemy hides, the guard will flank the enemy in order to kill it. For the Scientist, they will run and hide from enemies. When following the player during a firefight, they will panic but still follow the player. If the scientist is injured while following, he will stop following the player and will attempt to run away from enemies. When a grenade is throw at their position, both the scientist and security guard will run away from it.

   HECU Engineer

   The Medic carries health supplies and use syringes to heal any wounded Marines when not following the player. If idle, a wounded Marine will often yell "Medic!" and the Medic will heal the wounded Marine. For the Marine, if he is heavily wounded, he will hold his right leg with his left hand and have the other hand to hold the weapon, which is useful to know that the Marine is close to dying. As for the player, the player must approach the Medic and hold the "USE" key to restore health. Like the Engineer, the Medic can also assist the player by fighting enemies with his

   In firefights, soldiers use a variety of squad tactics when engaging hostile targets. These tactics include flanking, providing each other with covering fire, and effective use of grenades. When shooting, soldiers are almost always in crouched to engage enemies. When enemies hide, the soldiers will either flank, throw a hand grenade, or launch a grenade from the MP5 to kill or flush an enemy target out. If the enemy is at the point blank range, the Soldiers will kick as a melee attack. When the player is injured by enemies while soldiers are following the player, all soldiers that are following by player will be alerted and will start to fire at the attacker, except the Medic where he will only be alerted when he sees the enemy. When a grenade is thrown at his position or someone else (whether it's an ally or an enemy) or when a Soldier launches a grenade, they will run or commence the cover position.

Unlike Barney, Otis won't attack the player if he sees the player kill another Guard or a Scientist; he'll just simply comment about it. Otis also makes up some jokes such as "My mom will be worried when I'm not at her house tonight" and if the player injure Otis, he will say "I don't want to die like a virgin".
