It might be that they were only recently acquired, or that the scientist simply never worked in the labs which studied alien wildlife.

They are quite hardy opponents, having very high health compared to most other combatants, having about 2.5 times as much health as a Marine or Black Ops, and roughly 40% to 60% more health than an Alien Grunt (varying somewhat based on difficulty setting) and are tough enough to survive a direct hit from a grenade even on the lower difficulties.

    are effective weapons against the Shock Trooper. The Desert Eagle and M249 can kill it quickly, and the SPAS-12's secondary fire can instantly kill it should all of them hit it at close range. For the MP5, the player can fire a grenade at the Shock Trooper, then finish it off with the primary fire.

This is believed to be an error in the code as the developers did not disable the Marines' "nemesis" function which overrides their AI, which on makes Shock Troopers ignore the player and solely target their specified nemeses, in this case, the ones attributed to the Marines.
