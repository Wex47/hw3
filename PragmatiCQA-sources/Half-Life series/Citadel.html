With an unknown height (presumably tens of thousands of feet), it is a fortress that rises both high into the sky and extends a great distance underground as well. It is a triangular structure when viewed from above, and was crowned by a Dark Energy Reactor. Its associated portal was the primary means of communication with off-world Combine forces.

   The Citadel has two known "states," or configurations that the tower takes depending on specific situations. The first of these is what was most likely the dormant configuration, which was probably maintained during the whole life in the city, when no serious threats were posed to the Combine (the structure also takes this shape during

A small piece of plating barely visible on the left (southern) side of the Citadel also descends partly down the tower, scanners rapidly deploy from around that area on the tower, and the Citadel remains in this configuration for the remainder of the game. The Citadel can also be seen from the rear near the first gate and

The lower set of ribs descends along the tower and locks in place behind the lowest panel on the right-hand side of the structure. It can be theorized that there are other configurations the Citadel may take in different situations, but these two are the only configurations depicted in the game.

Whilst mostly looking very much the same as the rest of the Citadel, no war factories or synth manufacturing plants are located in this area of the structure. During this point in the game, the Citadel can be seen extremely unstable, with an orange glow throughout the structure in contrast to the blue it used to be when functional. Fires have spread across the structure and much debris from what's left of the upper levels is constantly falling down to the lower levels.

The core chamber is protected by large blast doors carrying an insignia with the appearance of a stylized version of the international symbol for radioactivity. A large control room is situated overlooking the core with a central access lift leading down to its chamber, similar in design to the control room overlooking the Dark Fusion reactor at the opposite end of the structure. Three rooms are located across the chamber which are specifically designed to help stabilize the core in the event that its energy output becomes unstable. The machines in these rooms form a threefold containment system that ensures that the intensity of the dark energy reaction within the core stays within safe limits. Connected onto the core itself is a train station where it is likely that

Abundance of Combine technology is found within the Citadel, ranging from countless generators and force fields, to matter disintegration fields, to elevators and platforms that defy gravity, to giant tubes that transport unknown fluids. The entire building is constructed from the same blackish blue metal material that all Combine structures are made from. No attempt is made at all to provide personnel with any form of warmth or pleasant aesthetic. Everything is sharp, cold, and soulless, mirroring that of the Combine's rule. No regard is placed at all to the covering of the piping and electronics. The metal is unfinished and oxidizing. The human features that are present however, such as walkways, stairs and ladders, seem to just be an afterthought, as if the usability for humans was not a firsthand priority.

   On one of the very top levels of the Citadel is Doctor Breen's office, believed to be the location from which he transmits his Breencasts-though the walls do not match his "studio" backdrop, suggesting there is a separate room for that purpose. Unlike the rest of the Citadel, Breen's office has a more classical, human look to it, although Combine architecture is still a very dominating, albeit aesthetic, feature in the room. His office includes various luxury items such as a wooden desk, mantle clock, leather seat, globe, expensive carpeting, tiled floors, and busts of himself, much like the generator rooms in the Overwatch nexus. His office also contains a large set of monitors, which act as his personal computer, and from which he can communicate with contacts such as the Advisors. Breen's office is connected to the prisoner transport system used by Gordon Freeman, and there are many other prisoner pods around his office. Otherwise, more welcome guests can access the office via an elevator connected to the dark fusion reactor or a separate door from the prisoner entrance. It can be assumed that Breen lives in the Citadel as well as works in it, presumably never leaving it, as the Advisors.

   The Citadel is under construction at the time of Half-Life: Alyx, five years before the events of Half-Life 2, or roughly fifteen years after the Seven Hour War. This suggests that either the Citadel took several years to be built or that construction began relatively late into the Combine's invasion, or perhaps both.

   The initial form of the Citadel started when the Combine delivered the Core to earth, contained withing a spire structure that was embedded into the floor through the means of teleportation; the citadel was then built around it from underground to top. The Citadel construction consists of gathered resources from Earth, which were collected by the Combine and converted to their bluish material.

   Attached to the construction areas all over the Citadel are several sets of slack grouped cables, with substation structures on the ground providing support to them. Those were most likely providing energy to the Citadel from an external source, as the Core was non-functional and suffering blackouts by the time. The location of the core on Alyx's whiteboard suggests it was moved to the underground levels later on.

    A reddit user known as "rscreamroad" calculated what the real-world dimensions of the Citadel would be by studying the game files and other production information, concluding that it is 27,580 feet (8,406 meters) tall, 2,820 feet (860 meters) wide, and extends 750 feet (230 meters) underground. For comparison, Mount Everest is 29,032 feet (8,849 meters) tall.
