   The Hunter's body and legs are partially encased in an iridescent blue-green carapace. The synth is tripedal, much like the

   ; it has three muscular legs attached to the sides and back of its body, ending in a pair of extremely sharp barbs. On the left side of the Hunter's body are what appear to be three compound eyes, and a pair of vertically aligned fléchette launchers are located on the Synth's front. Located directly underneath the launchers are two small limbs tipped with metal blades for impaling targets, behind those and on the back are two oval shaped orifices. There is also an organ-like body located in the rear right area of the hunter's posterior.
  </p>
  <p key="ca2a71c9-dde5-4c19-a38d-74bfe7ad1558">
   Hunters have heavy blue colored armor on their bodies and take reduced damage from most forms of small firearms. They are also highly mobile, able to easily move out of the way of projectiles.
  </p>
  <p key="35231853-3ad6-4485-92f9-006aeb069628">
   Like all Synths, Hunters possess a number of vocalizations, all of which are shrill, fierce, and slightly electronic. Unlike any other Synths, they also appear to leak some sort of white-grey fluid, perhaps blood or blood substitute, when shot.
  </p>
  <p key="dd7f8075-cc76-47c4-b1bf-1d7a1d605774">
   It could be argued whether Hunters are Synths or Cyborgs as the

   . Apart from a vulnerability to gunfire, they appear to possess an implanted armor rather than a full metal body, and the possible blood substance produced by them when hurt also suggests organic matter. Additionally, they can also be disintegrated by

  <p key="5f2550c8-a2a8-40a5-80b1-1413ecddf0d3">
   Hunters appear to only be deployed in forests and rough terrain areas as their design appears to be more suitable to such environments as opposed to urban areas.

   If multiple Hunters are deployed in the same mission area, they use pack hunting tactics like flanking and suppression fire.
  </p>
  <p key="75fe22a5-3f9c-4c73-a64a-724ae29df383">
   The Hunter's most important role is to provide an escort for the Striders in the final battle of White Forest. While helping to suppress the rebels who are attempting to stop the Striders, they prioritize
   Strider Busters
   that are launched, giving the strider a much higher chance of survival.
  </p>
  <p key="a28e7dd0-2d48-455f-b506-fb65df2fb276">
   Although possessing less firepower and armor than their larger tripodal cousin, Hunters are much more agile and fast. A Hunter will normally attempt to engage opponents at medium range, allowing it to fire fléchette rounds with great accuracy. Since the fléchettes move slowly compared to bullets, the Hunter has trouble against long-distance enemies but can cover ground quickly.
  </p>
  <p key="d52ceb78-253b-40e1-8d53-747030ddd127">
   Since Hunters are resourceful and quick-thinking Synths, they employ a number of useful tactics to increase the chance of hitting a target - for example, making use of splash damage, and closing distances with a charge.

   The Hunter's main weapons are the pair of fléchette launchers located on its forward surface. These fire large, fast fléchettes with a small spread which do large damage upon a direct hit, capable of vaporizing biological matter with a few hits. Additionally,
   <span key="ad773fcf-7b53-42f6-8b4f-945fbe05ae22">
    should the fléchette hit a solid object,
   </span>
   it'll deal splash damage within a small radius. The fléchettes are only made more dangerous with the Hunter's firing tactics. They are highly skilled with the launching of the fléchettes, leading its target (shooting ahead of a moving target to compensate for its movement) in addition to walking its fire onto a target (shooting at a point near the target and shifting its aim towards it).
  </p>
  <p key="4e06dd25-88ee-433d-ab85-2b87383a3b0c">
   In melee, the Hunter can also use its body as a ram to break down walls, doors or vulnerable foes. While it's charging, the Hunter is unable to turn quickly. Should it hit however, the Hunter can do a large amount of damage to its target. However, if
   <span key="259ddec1-ad37-48ff-bf62-02563a4f76ce">
    it misses and runs into an unbreakable object, then the Hunter will be temporarily dazed from the impact.

    Matt T. Wood
    , one of the team's main goals for the Hunter was to make the player feel vulnerable whether hiding or not. The Hunter arena before the secondary silo in White Forest became their testbed for improving the Hunters' close-combat behavior. A classic combat space, featuring multiple exits and many possible paths, the team tuned it for a strong cat-and-mouse game-play experience. While players have many options for escape, the map is designed so that Hunters will never completely lose them - but always be able to pursue and flush the player out of hiding. They are also reprogrammed to focus on the player and will briefly ignore other NPCs.
