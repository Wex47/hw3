As the G-Man delivers this closing monologue, the plane carries them away from Black Mesa, shortly before a nuclear blast flashes outside confirming its destruction. The aircraft's location then suddenly switches to the skies of Xen, then finally to an emptiness similar to that encountered by the Black Mesa tram at the end of

He then explains that he was the one to "pluck" Alyx Vance from Black Mesa, despite objections from unidentified naysayers that she was "a mere child, and of no practical use to anyone," and that he has learned to "ignore such naysayers, when quelling them was out of the question" (An image of Doctor Breen flashes in the background during a short pause between "when" and "quelling"). He then instructs Gordon to safely escort Alyx to White Forest, as repayment for the G-Man's previous insurance of his survival, stating he wished he could do more than simply monitor Gordon, but has agreed to "abide by certain restrictions." While Alyx is still unconscious, he then whispers into her ear to tell her father to "prepare for

   Just after she delivers the message to her father, Alyx seems dizzy and holds her head, suggesting that she wasn't consciously speaking. The G-Man flashes on the screen just before she delivers the message, which could have triggered her to say it subconsciously.

Eli is noticeably disturbed by the words, to the point where he almost collapses in shock. After making up an excuse for Alyx to leave the room, Eli reveals to Gordon that he is aware of their "mutual friend" as well. He explains that the G-Man delivered sample GG-3883 which ultimately caused the Black Mesa Incident, and whispered in his ear to "prepare for unforeseen consequences" shortly before the Resonance Cascade. Eli then begins to express the hope that he and Gordon will be able to take some unknown action, but is interrupted by Alyx's return.

He then shows her the future where Eli Vance is killed by a Combine Advisor and rewinds time, giving her the opportunity to kill the Advisor. Alyx does so, and the G-Man points out she has proven a worthy successor to Freeman, whom he claims to have grown dissatisfied with due to Freeman's inability or refusal to carry out his orders.

He also tends to elongate consonants, especially the "S." Overall he appears to be uncomfortable with and unused to human languages.

During the dialogue with Alyx, the G-Man seems to be shifting in multitude of his copies, hinting that he is either capable of being present at multiple places at once or capable of predicting and experiencing multiple various futures that are yet to happen. This can be seen when speaking to Alyx and almost every answer he gives her is followed by a new "clone" of the G-man leaving the scene as if every answer of G-man to Alyx's question created a different timeline of events.

   In most games featuring the G-Man, there are several sequences when the G-Man is talking at close range to the player, and various areas can be seen in the background, including areas from Black Mesa or even areas the player will visit later into the game. In these sequences, the G-Man talks to the player (the player's character never responds or reacts in any way) and can be seen quickly appearing in different portions of the screen, in dream-like sequences. He also appears on TV screens and Breencasts dotted around the environment; G-Man also seems to have technopathic or telepathic abilities of some sort, as the player will occasionally see his face on things such as unplugged televisions.

   The G-Man likely uses the ability to manipulate the senses of individuals, to see and hear what he wants them to. This ability could explain the appearance of the G-Man on unplugged televisions or the Black Mesa Anomalous Materials lobby in the Episode 2 cutscene.
