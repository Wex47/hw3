   In June 2004, Valve announced in a press release that the FBI had arrested several people suspected of involvement in the source code leak.
   Valve claimed the game had been leaked by a German black-hat hacker named Axel Gembe, aka 'Ago',
   born c. 1982. Gembe later contacted Newell through e-mail (also providing an unreleased document planning the E3 events). Gembe was led into believing that Valve wanted to employ him as an in-house security auditor. He was offered a flight to the USA and was to be arrested on arrival by the FBI. When the German government became aware of the plan, Gembe was arrested in Germany instead and put on trial for the leak as well as other computer crimes in November 2006, such as the creation of Agobot, a highly successful trojan which harvested users' data.
  </p>
  <p key="62b7fea8-f682-442d-8b9a-f047285c7867">
   At the trial in November 2006 in Germany, Gembe was sentenced to two years' probation. In imposing the sentence, the judge took into account such factors as Gembe's difficult childhood and the fact that he was taking steps to improve his situation.

   The files leaked in 2003 consist of a playable game available in two versions, the "anon-hl2" leak and the "Russian" leak, both of which slightly different from the other. The "Russian" copy of the leak is based on the original 100 part leak "anon-hl2". One of the few notable differences between the two is the presence of an installer, while the "anon-hl2" leak consists of 100 .rar files.

   The original demos, .cfg files used to record the demos and .bat files (demoloop.bat) used to start the demos played at E3 are included in the 2003 leak, but there are so many differences between the engine used at E3 and the leaks that it is impossible to play them.

   Something notable is the fact that all of the 2003 leaked Beta demonstrations are broken in one way or another. Most stem from missing models and incorrect usage of props (ex. the game uses a prop_physics for a model when the engine only thinks that prop can be prop_static, so it deletes it). Almost all the presentations have been fixed and included in the mod

    Traptown is as well extremely broken. The metal bars that are supposed to hit the soldiers about halfway through the demo are released as soon as the map begins because the game deletes the objects restraining it. The "Troop forcing open the door" scripted sequence only works about half of the time, the soldier on the third floor of the building never appears, the player can hear distorted music in the building, the radiator constraint is broken, tossing a grenade under the trash can will crash the game, and the blade trap at the end does not work.
