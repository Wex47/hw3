   Each Advisor wears a skin-tight olive-green bodysuit that covers all but the ends of their bodies, with a collar adorned with golden glyphs around their "necks." They also have a pair of thin black robotic arms implanted to their backs, capable of grabbing and lifting an adult human and moving the Advisor's weight. They also have an appendage that can protrude from their mouth like an elongated tongue, though it is more or less phallic in appearance. The appendage is used similarly to an invertebrate's proboscis and plunged into a weak point, such as the human neck shown from a scene in

   It is possible that the Advisors are the master race of the Combine, though the evidence is inconclusive. The Advisors are the highest ranking beings witnessed on Earth, but Earth itself is of nominal interest to the Combine, raising the question of why the Advisors would bother settling on Earth and managing its affairs whatsoever rather than delegating the task to lesser beings. Whether they are the Combine's master race, a high-ranking species in the Combine, or simply something akin to middle management remains to be seen.

They are also able to levitate themselves and achieve flight, presumably with telekinesis.

    , the Advisors are revealed to be another species enslaved by the Combine. They were once a utopian society of philosophers and scientists who spent most of their time in an artificial dream state. For this reason, they were easily conquered when the Combine came to their homeworld. The Combine forced the species to never mature beyond its adolescent "grub" stage, and used their bodies as hosts for the greatest minds of all their subjugated worlds. During this time, a few members of the species managed to flee into outer space, while others placed themselves into dream states that would endure a hundred thousand years. The homeworld of the Advisors is for reasons unknown kept a secret by the Combine, who maintain its existence is a myth.
