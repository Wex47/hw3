   , humans surgically modified with Combine technology, are overall much deadlier and more resilient than normal human beings. They are also highly trained, and can adapt well beyond the confines of Earth, in other universes and dimensions if needed, as in-game dialogue mentions potential deployment of Overwatch units across the Combine Empire in a "permanent off-world assignment." Assignment on other worlds is considered a terrible fate for Overwatch soldiers unfortunate enough to be stuck with it, and is often used as a punishment or threat only. Equally dire is the threat of "permanent off-world relocation" directed towards citizens. Judging by dialogue from Breen, many of the territories under control by the Combine are nigh-uninhabitable by humans without life support systems.

   Little is offered in the way of explanation for teleportation physics, but it's known that the Resistance's teleporters use Xen as a "dimensional slingshot" — whereby instead of entering and exiting Xen as Black Mesa originally did, teleports could instead "swing around" the borderworld and return to their own dimension without the need to use Xen as a layover. Combine teleporters cannot do this, instead apparently using "string-based" technology, similar to Black Mesa's "
   Calabi-Yau
   model." However, according to Mossman, the Combine fail at this method because they don't "factor in the Dark Energy equations".

These gases were harmful to humans but most likely ideal for an environment that the Combine master race could inhabit. It was up to Gordon Freeman to travel to the Combine Air Exchange after the prison levels. Gordon's actions at the Air Exchange were to trigger the human insurrection against the Combine in City 17 but dropped and made to happen due to Gordon's actions at Nova Prospekt.

   Breencasts are regular broadcasts made by Earth administrator Dr. Wallace Breen, delivered to the populace of Combine-controlled towns and cities via private televisions and, more commonly, large video monitors mounted on walls in public places such as town squares and railway stations. In his speech on human instinct, he refers to the Combine as "Our Benefactors" and describes their empire as a "universal union". As the messages loop, all announcements could be pre-recorded. A few citizens in the
   first chapter

   Most examples of Combine structures are large and imposing, with very blocky, monolithic shapes with sharp angles made of dull, blue-gray metal. Various tubes, wires, and pipes can be seen running throughout gaps in the walls and down along corridors and tunnels. Their buildings are purely functional, with no thought given for comfort, embellishments or decorations. Limited usage of aesthetics include infrequent usage of Combine imagery such as signs or logos, and artificial brightness creating harsh, dark shadows throughout the Combine's complexes.
  </p>
  <p key="0b9ca829-397c-45d6-9ff4-41c238daa594">
   Steep, deep drops and lack of guardrails are in Combine complexes as well. This lack of railing and deep falls are likely due to the Advisors' ability to fly and thus not need bridges. Bridges are, however, in places where Combine soldiers move and operate; another example of the Combine's assimilation of human technologies. The material the Combine use for their constructs remains unknown.

    The Combine originally was to use Earth's building materials and twist them to construct their buildings. This mix of materials resulted in odd designs, such as the Citadel's interior made out of ceramic tiles. The material mix became the more familiar building material used by the Combine in the final version.
