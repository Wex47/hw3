   Personality Cores are typically stored within a case equipped with two handles, above and under, which fits around the Core itself. They have a large, single "eye", which glows in a color related to its function, a pupil varying in size, and a varying number of dots at each side of the eye. The Core can rotate in all directions within its case, allowing it to see in every direction not hidden by the case. In the back of the Core, a three-pin plug to connect it to computer terminals can typically be found.

   , Wheatley states that a Personality Core is never to disengage itself from its ceiling rail, as doing so would supposedly result in the termination of the core, though he later disproves the point himself as he survives even after being detached. Contrary to popular belief, a detached core can move. A detached core moves very slowly and tediously, rotating its exterior shell and handlebars.

Wheatley and GLaDOS would express various feelings such as enthusiasm, fear, or anger, in an advanced way.

   When the cores become damaged, they usually develop problems. Some include a feedback loop, which causes them to have the same thoughts or processes over and over again, or multiple personalities, where a core will constantly switch between the personality of someone else and its own, or try and make sense of random data. When a core experiences these symptoms, the Aperture Science main computer (usually GLaDOS or Wheatley) cannot function properly; therefore, a core transfer is needed. If an alternate core is present in the main computer chamber, the
   <a href="Aperture Science Announcement System.html" key="edd581d3-1e23-4fb3-9f4d-1018eca8ffbc" title="Aperture Science Announcement System">
    Aperture Science Announcement System
   </a>
   will detect it and note that a core transfer may be needed and ask that an associate plug the replacement core into the
   Aperture Science Core Transfer Receptacle
   . It will then ask the cores if they would like to proceed with a core transfer. If both cores agree or disagree then the transfer will either continue or stop. However, if one core disagrees with the other, then a stalemate occurs and it is up to a qualified Stalemate Associate to decide if the core transfer procedure should continue or stop. To continue the transfer, the Stalemate Associate needs to press the Stalemate Resolution Button in the Resolution Annex, just off the main computer chamber. Once pressed, the core transfer will proceed and the new core will be installed onto the main computer system. Defective cores are then taken to a storage space, most likely awaiting incineration or destruction.
  </p>
  <p key="827e9231-523e-4dae-8745-83d1f784753b">
   In one instance, Wheatley had concealed several bombs behind raised panels opposite of the Resolution Annex entrance, which he then detonated when the button was pressed. The bombs can be seen just after the room is revealed and can be seen through the panels after they are raised.
  </p>
  <p key="a2dbc54f-1a59-427d-a0e0-34b125d5cfff">
   Aperture AIs experience a great deal of simulated pain during a core transfer. Considering that the core controlling the facility is connected to the central body by large amounts of wiring rather than a single plug, a likely explanation is that core transfers require the replacement core to sustain a degree of physical modification, without being shut down, during the procedure.

    The Personality Core went through several design iterations. At some point during development, the Cores were simple grey spheres attached to a large ring with an undetermined blue glowing matter, with GLaDOS being a large sphere above the ring. Later in development, they were glowing light blue spheres, hanging to a "
    Birth of Venus
    "-like GLaDOS,
    until they were given their more detailed design with the different colors, reminiscent of a
    webcam
    design.

    However, the idea of multiple cores besides Wheatley shown throughout the facility was cut due to the amount of time it would take to introduce more than one core. The idea was partially recycled into the three defective cores.
