   An unknown amount of time later, the Enrichment Center has fallen into serious disrepair and restless personality cores travel on rails in the ceilings. One such core,

   , wakes Chell up from stasis and, eventually, convinces her to detach him from the rail and find an escape from the facility. However, they accidentally awaken GLaDOS, who perceives Chell as her 'murderer' and seemingly kills Wheatley. GLaDOS forces Chell through increasingly difficult tests as she rebuilds the Aperture facility. Wheatley returns, having survived GLaDOS awakening, and frees Chell from the testing. Together, they escape to the manufacturing sector of the facility and disable GLaDOS's turrets and neurotoxin. They travel back up to GLaDOS (through a vacuum tube), whose core has become corrupt. They initiate a 'core transfer,' substituting GLaDOS's core for Wheatley's. Wheatley becomes corrupt with power, places GLaDOS's consciousness in a potato, betrays Chell, and drops both of them deep into the bowels of the facility.

   After going through several old test chambers led by recordings of the Aperture CEO Cave Johnson, made in Aperture's early years, Chell is reunited with GLaDOS. After this, GLaDOS becomes ornithophobic, shown off more in the Portal 2 Multiplayer DLC. GLaDOS discovers her persona was based on Cave's former assistant, Caroline, who was forcefully uploaded to an AI supercomputer. Eventually, they get back into the test chambers where Wheatley has invented "Frankenturrets". After many tests, Chell finds her way to Wheatley's lair, where she and GLaDOS attach corrupted Personality Cores to Wheatley in order to trigger another core transfer. Chell is wounded by a bomb trap before the process is complete, but she manages to trap Wheatley on the moon. Chell is later let free from the facilities by GLaDOS, who will now replace her with P-body and ATLAS.
