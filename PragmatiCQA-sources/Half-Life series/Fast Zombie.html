   When a Fast Zombie is approaching, the player can use the environment to their advantage. Hiding behind cover and staying close to the edge, then waiting for the Zombie to come around the corner is advised. The player then can fire the shotgun as soon as the Zombie is in range. Shooting the Zombie as they leap can instantly kill them in mid-air. It is recommended to use the

   for this, however, because the shotgun has a slightly lower precision and it is hard to hit Zombie's head with the Colt Python while leaping.

This tactic will work with most other enemies, except for, of course, the ones that throw or, in the

   . When investigating an area littered with Zombie corpses, check if any still have headcrabs attached to their head, as this is a good sign the Zombie is merely playing dead. If so, shoot them in the head with the Colt Python or Shotgun just in case or throw a grenade at them if the player is unable to kill them without waking the Zombie up. It pays to be sure. One is also seen digging in a dumpster, showing that fast Zombies may be curious or of a higher intelligence than their brethren. Supporting this argument, if a grenade is thrown into the dumpster while the fast Zombie is still inside, the grenade may be thrown back out. If another is thrown, it will explode and set the Zombie on fire. The player can then retreat to one of the supply rooms and close the door, as Fast Zombies cannot open doors.
