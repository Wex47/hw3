   At some point late in GLaDOS' construction, Doug went to see his colleague

   while he was working on the AI in his chamber. Henry praised their technological advances, stating that artificial consciousness is the next frontier. Doug was not convinced by this since GLaDOS attempted to kill everyone each time she was turned on, forcing them to switch her off. Later, Doug came across Henry while he was designing the
   Morality Core
   . Henry asked him to turn it on, then Doug asked him what it was, to which Henry answered that it was the latest in AI inhibition technology, that it would act on GLaDOS as her conscience. Rattmann believed it was insufficient to stop her murderous intentions, arguing that "

   she became self-aware, locked down the facility, and flooded the Enrichment Center with deadly neurotoxins. Rattmann was one of the only survivors, and GLaDOS turned onto taunting him about his schizophrenia. She attempted to convince him that his situation was a result of his paranoia, but he ignored her.

   Rattmann then spent the next several months surviving in the Test Chambers and maintenance areas of Aperture. Having only two anti-psychotic pills left, he kept them for the day GLaDOS would wake Chell. Consequently, he slowly lost his sanity, his schizophrenia completely taking him over.

   Rattman has obsessions over objects such as the moon, cats and Companion Cubes. Shown in one of his drawings, he was trying to use science to combine a cat and a companion cube (likely reference to Schrödinger's cat, which was explicitly mentioned on page 20 of
   Lab Rat
   ).

   Prior to the activation of GLaDOS, despite already being schizophrenic and taking medication, Rattman was otherwise quite sane and level-headed, and was skeptical and worried with the work on GLaDOS, believing that a conscience would not be enough to stop her, as opposed to
   Henry
   's enthusiasm. However, as time passed when he was trapped in the facility, he grew increasingly insane and started being obsessed with the Companion Cube, making it work as his source of logic.

   The results of the
   Aperture Science Collaborative Disposition Test
   tell that Rattmann is the quiet, artistic type, happy to ponder the solution to a puzzle in quiet solitude, and that compatible cooperative test partners include introspective loners, deaf-mute invisible people, and mannequins.

   show that Rattmann is an educated man, quoting both
   Dickinson
   and
   Longfellow
   to express himself over the loss of his Weighted Companion Cube, as well as a small reference to
   Auden
   . Rattmann's drawings range from simple scribbles to more elaborate artwork, such as a giant mural of Chell in

   Aside from his scribblings, Rattmann appears to have adept technical skills. Apparently using the login name and password he managed to procure, he was able to open up certain wall sections in Test Chambers, make
   Vital Apparatus Vents
   dispense more Weighted Storage Cubes, and take pictures of the Companion Cube (probably by using the
