   Snipers are very accurate, and will fire ahead of any moving target so the pulse from the rifle hits them dead on. However, it is possible to confuse the sniper by running in one direction until he fires, then suddenly changing direction, then repeating the same process again until they reach cover. The round travels so much slower than other bullets that sidestepping the shot is quite easy at long range. However, even in Easy mode snipers will take leading shots(shooting to the direction the target is supposed to go) and in Hard, they almost have a guaranteed hit, and will take you down in 2-3 shots without armor.
They will also shoot breakable objects to limit the amount of cover the target can use.

   Snipers seem to take the doctrine "shoot anything that moves" quite literally, shooting at any living creature (except allied Combine forces), such as birds, and even signs.

   will blow the sniper out of his hole nicely. This can be easier said than done, however, because if the sniper spots the player before they're within range, which is often the case, they'll have to avoid his fire to get close enough. Closing the gap can prove to be painful due to the projectile speed of the sniper rifle, sprinting while strafing will increase the likelihood for snipers to miss their shots. The

   Snipers will try to expose the player from cover if they're hiding behind light or breakable objects by shooting them. Even unbreakable objects such as barrels can be knocked some distance by the impact of the bullet. Due to its immense power, a bullet that hit into an unbreakable object will knock off from the Gravity Gun. Sniper will shoot explosive barrels if the player is close enough to them; theoretically, it is possible to take out sniper using explosive barrel if the player has no other explosives, but it is highly dangerous to do so because of this.

    , Alyx again uses a sniper rifle to aid Gordon as he travels through a zombie-infested mining complex. This time, though, the rifle is visible to the player before they descend into the complex. It is in a fixed emplacement in a window, suggesting that the recoil of the weapon makes firing it freehand difficult, or simply as a form of control to prevent it from being taken by the player. Another reason why it may be bolted to the window is because of its immense size; it is as big and as cumbersome as an

    . This could also explain why the weapon is never knocked out of sniper's nests by explosions. Also worth noting is the fact that it had to be recharged by a Vortigaunt before it would function. Some players have found a bug during this sequence: If the player manages to detonate any form of explosive in the sniper's nest Alyx is supposedly occupying, the corpse of a

As well, the NPC is immune to bullet fire, and can only be killed by explosives or AR2's alt fire. When it is killed it will always be propelled forward by the mechanism they use fall out of the nests in-game. It is also worth noting that the Sniper's placeholder model will collide with grenades or any other object thrown at it, making spawned Snipers a bit harder to kill if the player spawns them in a "nest".

    The sound-script for the Overwatch Sniper references the names of sound files that indicate that snipers were originally to talk over their radios, similar to the normal Overwatch Soldiers. Within these, sniper refers to itself as "scalpel", in keeping with the medical terminology used by the Combine.
