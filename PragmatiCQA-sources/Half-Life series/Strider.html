  <p key="a1305017-385b-4a59-93e5-960bd9c8e433">
   Striders are capable of pursuing hostiles in both confined streets and open plazas, even crouching down to fire at enemies who seek cover under overhangs or in bombed-out buildings.
  </p>
  <p key="5e8657e2-461f-4945-a151-20f4aa62359f">
   The Strider's body is covered in a smooth brown carapace or exoskeleton. On the "head" of the Strider is a rapid-firing pulse cannon, with a heavier warp cannon suspended below. The three long legs of the Strider are tipped with sharp spikes and a rosette of finer, hair-like spines.
  </p>
  <p key="22babd81-0905-4379-a947-bcc60ff34c43">
   While walking about or attacking, Striders produce many different vocalizations, such as growls, groans, whoops, and howls; when killed, they let out a mournful cry. In addition, Striders will leak a yellow substance when their interior is damaged, and their carapace contains a large, somewhat human-looking brain.

   , Striders that are seen on Earth are not biological creatures with cybernetic implants but, rather, synthetic copies of their natural counterparts that were retrofitted for the needs of the Combine. Backman states that Striders are scanned in their natural environments by the Combine and the data acquired is used to build their synthetic version that is used for the Combine war machine, as well as maintenance and building.

   ; this version, however, possesses no offensive capabilities and was redesigned to aid in engineering and maintenance.
  </p>
  <p key="e6968de9-d67a-4803-9213-b84c2668ddf6">
   Each Strider possesses a mechanical platform attached to their main body, from which Combine Workers operate from. The platform consists of three devices; a mechanical torch arm, which is used for welding work; binoculars, and a machine of unknown function, all of which are operated by Combine Workers. Mechanical legs connecting the platform to the strider also keep the platform levelled and prevent Workers from falling off.
  </p>
  <p key="7cc2b04d-c184-4b7e-9fee-392114762a49">
   Constructions striders were modified in several ways; their legs have been enhanced with augmentation devices to aid with roof climbing and improve balance, their
   warp cannon
   was replaced with a connector; which is used to move and connect large cables to Combine devices on rooftops, as shown in the first section of the game; and their pulse cannons were also replaced with a single large robotic eye.
  </p>
  <p key="89b5a911-2c91-4efd-83e5-c5b105604953">
   Construction striders appear to have a very firm and heavy walk, apart from the more soft and slow walk from normal striders, this behavior may be due to the augmentation devices attached to their legs. They are observed to cause infrastructural damage as they walk.

   and to provide heavy support for groups of soldiers. However, in full-scale military combat, Striders are used instead as heavy artillery to destroy all structures in an area as a means of removing all entrenched hostile forces. Striders fit both roles well due to their various weapons and remarkable maneuverability on even the harshest terrain (considering they are tripods, and extremely large). Despite their height, Striders can crawl through tunnels to chase enemy combatants and "dig" through underground obstacles using their warp cannon.

   </a>
   mounted on the front of the Strider's carapace. The second (and by far the more powerful) weapon is a warp cannon mounted on the Strider's belly under the pulse cannon. This cannon not only causes scenic destruction but also inflicts massive splash damage that will vaporize anything in proximity to the area of impact. Prior to the warp cannon's discharge, a thin blue laser indicates where the Strider is aiming at and the space around the weapon becomes warped, bending light as the cannon charges. They are strong enough to kick vehicles into the air. Besides using ranged weapons, Striders can impale targets with their long legs, any target that is impaled will die instantly, if they come too close. When a target is impaled while still on their legs, the Strider will swing its legs to "drop" the target's corpse.

Alyx dispatches the soldiers and confirms the Strider is not working: Russell remarks that it would be terrible if it came back to life.

After fighting off some more Combine soldiers while evading the Strider, Alyx discovers a Combine gun which she uses to destroy it.

    Due to their incredibly high damage output and pinpoint accuracy on their last few hits, cover plays an extremely important role while fighting Striders. Often, instead of fighting in the open, one is much less likely to die while only running out of cover when running to another spot or when launching a rocket. However, in Episode One and Episode Two, the damage is lowered but taking cover is still important.

While they were excited with the early implementations, it became obvious that players were uncertain of their role in the scene. Originally the confrontation built slowly with Dog squaring off against the Strider, but having such a slow beginning proved problematic. It looked good in the

    . Tuning it required many, many months of testing and iteration to address playtest feedback, and this was complicated by the fact that every time the team playtested, they saw individuals adopt completely different approaches to defeating the Striders. Some threw logs at Hunters; others relied on their Rebel companions to kill them. Some players never sprinted, while others never used the car. They tried to keep supporting all the different strategies that occurred to players, so that their experiments with tactics would be rewarding rather than frustrating. Meanwhile, they had to make sure the Strider and Hunter behaviors were consistent, and balance the experience so that it would be a satisfying game experience for all different play styles at every skill level.
