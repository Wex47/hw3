   The ASHPD is a hand-held device which has the ability to manufacture two linked portals. No matter the distance between them, any object which passes through one portal will emerge from the other and vice versa instantaneously. The portals can be placed on any surface which is made out of manufactured or refined moon rock and large enough to accommodate them. Though considering that fact that portals can be placed on what seems to be standard concrete, and that the device was used in the 1950s by Aperture before the discovery of the moon rocks’s capabilities, it is likely that moon rock is not required for the creation of portals but instead just very effective. Moving objects, or certain types of surfaces, will prevent the formation of a portal (The only exception to this is in the
   neurotoxin generator
   in Portal 2).

  <p key="f7e14bc2-ebdd-4630-8e2f-8460e6040915">
   The ASHPD is held with a hand behind the weapon, holding the handle/trigger, while the other hand supports the barrel. A light in the small hole on the top of the ASHPD and its glowing glass tube both have the color of the last portal shot. It has two triggers, one for each of its two portals.
  </p>
  <p key="5f61e4ae-bf0d-4f14-a07a-88ccedbaccc3">
   When the ASHPD is fired, a burst of colored energy is emitted from the barrel, corresponding to the colored portal it is intended to create. Upon striking the targeted surface, a portal is formed, surrounded by a colored ring. If the surface cannot accommodate a portal for whatever reason, the shot will dissipate in a shower of colored particles. If one portal is shot into its opposite, the portal will be formed next to the first one, assuming the surface has enough room for it to form; otherwise, it will dissipate as normal. The device can only create two portals at a time. If a third is fired, the other of its type will be automatically closed and a new link will be formed.

   The portals fired by the ASHPD each have a distinct color.

   but far weaker. It can pick up objects, but only those directly in front of it. If the space between the object and the ASHPD is interrupted by a solid object, there is a chance that the object will be dropped, which can sometimes occur when traveling through portals at high velocity and the object accidentally hits the edge of the portal or another object in the surrounding area. It also cannot punt them as the Gravity Gun can, so the only way to throw the object is to physically swing the ASHPD itself, which can at best send the object a few meters away. It cannot catch

The pedestal is constantly turning on itself, and the ASHPD shoots a portal each time it faces one of the four walls of the room it is in.

   , detaching them and making them fall on the ground. When shooting a portal on an unauthorized surface, the weapon's ray will bounce off and be turned into blue or orange particles that shortly disappear. The surfaces a portal can be created on are the white tiles found in many areas or surfaces covered in conversion gel, which is made of ground-up moon rocks.
   Portals can also be formed on the moon itself.

   With the noted exception of cameras, a portal is incapable of causing physical damage to either humans or objects. If a portal is closed while something is between it and the destination, the object will automatically be pushed out of one or the other, depending on which one the object is closer to. There are a few instances where the player can use portals to kill themselves.

   will close, or "fizzle", any portal created by the ASHPD. This ensures that the Test Subject starts each new Test Chamber with a "clean" portal network, with their portals confined only to the Test Chamber they are currently in. They also appear within several chambers, forcing the Test Subject to find a way to work around them to complete an otherwise simple task.

  <p key="85f4064d-45e5-449c-9c93-075f7c15bf9f">
   The various Test Chambers require the use of several portal-creating techniques, where the ASHPD and
   momentum
   play a pivotal part:
  </p>
  <ul key="e811cac1-e859-44aa-be5c-0eef790e6f00">
   <li key="8181e700-207b-4d26-8e33-06cd018109e9">
    The most basic technique is "Flinging," whereby one transforms downward momentum into forward momentum by means of cleverly placed portals. This is mainly used to clear large gaps or obstacles when more orthodox means, such as stairs or lifts, are not available. The concept simply requires one to place one portal facing outward on a high wall across from the area that one wishes to fly over. Meanwhile, the second portal is placed in a nearby pit. By jumping into the portal in the pit, the momentum will "fling" the user through the wall portal and to their destination. A slight variant to this is the "Wedge Fling," where the wall-based portal is instead placed on an upward-slanted, elevated surface for vertical travel as opposed to horizontal travel.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul key="6b754b1d-b3cc-4e16-9070-caa363ad65c3">
   <li key="7aa3e4d3-99dc-421d-b8e1-4a8dfa35e181">
    A more complex form of "Flinging" is the "Double Fling," performed when lacking a deep enough pit from which to fling. It is performed in the same manner as flinging, but at a reduced height. In the absence of a pit or tall object to jump from, one portal is placed on the floor instead, while the other is placed on the wall as before. Entering into the floor portal will eject the player from the wall portal. As the player falls, they should move the floor portal below them (if necessary) to "catch" themselves. This portal will fling them through the wall portal with their momentum intact, thereby gaining the needed momentum without the use of a pit.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul key="8d2e2fff-e067-4597-b7a5-33e1efd42d0e">
   <li key="6795b87e-e526-45e0-b970-2a29ea77a809">
    In the absence of a portal-friendly high wall from which to fling, there is another way to exploit momentum for the purposes of reaching remote ledges: the "Floor-to-Floor" technique. Instead of placing one portal on a high wall, it is instead placed on the floor while the second is placed in a pit. Jumping into the pit ejects the player from the ground-level portal, allowing them to reach a previously unattainable ledge.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul key="07198971-00b0-40b2-aa34-ae5c2b8cb22b">
   <li key="72047bf8-65f8-4c62-bfa3-a78c589b6637">
    The last technique, advised to be mastered by the player who wants to succeed in the Advanced Chambers, is called "Portal Ledge." It involves standing partway through an already deployed portal and using it as a ledge to reach surfaces beyond the range of the current location. It can literally be used as a ledge to jump from, or another portal can be created from inside it and one can edge one's way toward a distant destination. The latter technique requires the player to exit out of their original portal immediately after placing the second portal, to prevent them from exiting through the original portal. Creatively utilized in this way, the Portal Ledge enables the player to skip large parts of rooms. This is prevented in

    . There is also a new type of Cube, the
    Scaling Cube
    , which can be manipulated by the ASHPD, allowing the user to make it larger and distort its shape. Doing so also changes the physical properties of the cube; making the cube larger, for example, not only increases its size but also its mass, allowing it to break a pane of glass that it normally could not and crush anything it lands on. These features work in both the single-player campaign and the Sixense map pack included with the DLC. Free aim is enabled in co-op, but all other features are disabled.
