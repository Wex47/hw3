   , Xen crystals must contain a substance that has anti-mass, or in other words, negative mass. Not to be confused with antimatter, negative mass is a property of a theoretical substance known as exotic matter. Scientists have theorized that if exotic matter could be discovered or created it might be possible to open up a wormhole, a sort of tunnel or shortcut through space or between universes.

   It is unsurprising that the Black Mesa scientists had a great interest in Xen crystals – as well as scientific curiosity, there were also obvious technological applications for a natural source of exotic matter. The

   developed at Black Mesa were enormous machines that required tremendous power supplies, but if the exotic energy in the Xen crystals could be harnessed teleportation could be made much simpler and more economical. The exotic energy was sometimes referred to as displacement energy due to its usage in the teleportation process.

  <p key="92c092ce-af0e-4270-b1be-7a03eff954d0">
   It is likely that the Xen crystals are a mix of both exotic matter and more normal matter, and since the sample that Gordon Freeman handled (GG-3883) was "the purest sample" it is likely it contained more exotic matter than previously discovered. Unfortunately, such a high concentration of exotic matter meant that the crystalline material had bizarre physical properties and was therefore very unstable. The powerful beam of the overloaded Anti-Mass Spectrometer damaged the crystals structure, causing a self-sustaining chain reaction known as a
   resonance cascade
   . The resulting release of exotic energy had devastating effects on the fabric of space-time, forming a ‘dimensional rift’ between

   Black Mesa scientists were making use of Xen crystals long before the resonance cascade disaster – the first teleportation experiments were only able to go to the Xen border world and not other locations on Earth, and as a temporary solution to this problem scientists created a relay device in the border world. The focus emitters were attached to an especially large Xen crystal, and it was this crystal that acted as the relay, receiving the teleport field and transmitting it back into our universe.

   states that "Doctor Kleiner compressed the Xen Relay far beyond anything he'd imagined at Black Mesa. We've figured out how to use Xen as an unexpressed axis, essentially a 'dimensional slingshot', so we can move around the border world without actually having to pass through it." This statement seems to imply that The Resistance had somehow developed teleportation to the point where the Xen Relay was nothing but a mathematical artifice, rendering the device on Xen pointless.
