   When Henry Jr. had first learned to walk, he demonstrated this ability by somehow finding his way up the roof of the
   family house

   1905

   (though his father would continue to refer to him as "Junior" well into his adult life
   ). The same year, Indy and his parents visited relatives in

   Henry was a curious but restless child. He would often prefer to spend time with his beloved dog, play baseball with friends or conduct scientific experiments rather than staying at school. At one time Henry tried to break the landspeed record and on another occasion he attempted to send his dog to the moon. Henry was a big fan of professional

But Henry Sr. was determined for his son to have the best tutor he could get. Seymour eventually relented and the family began the two year stretch. It would be nine days of study before Indiana saw his first adventure.

   . While Professor Jones lectured at
   the university
   , Miss Seymour took Indiana to see the
   Great Pyramids
   but hadn't paid their guide enough. He stole their
   camels
   as they scaled one of the ancient structures and left them stranded. Alone and unsure what to do next, the appearance of a figure heading in their direction on a bicycle surprised Miss Seymour as she recognized he was an old acquaintance of hers:

   . Lawrence was happy to entertain the idea, but admonished the boy when Indiana brought up the possibility of becoming rich from the profession, encouraging him instead to see archaeology as something to be shared with the world. The conversation led to Lawrence inviting Indiana and Miss Seymour to join him on a trip near the

   Sallam greeted them on their arrival to the camp where they discovered work was stalling after word had spread that a curse had befallen the site following the recent excavation of a tomb belonging to the Ancient Egyptian architect/engineer known as
   Kha
   . Neither Sallam nor Carter entertained the notion of a curse, and Indiana was shown some of the artifacts that has been discovered in the area as part of Carter's desire to find the tomb of boy king

   Carter allowed Indiana to be the first to enter Kha's tomb. Inside, they found the entrance to the burial chamber inscribed with a curse but pressed on and, when instructed, Sallam pried the door open to reveal a room scorched black surrounding the stone coffin of Kha. Lawrence suspected the room had already been searched when the coffin revealed no artifacts had been placed with the preserved corpse of Kha, and Duclos considered grave robbers but Carter was sure the door seals hadn't been broken and so there had to be another room. He was right, within the wall was secreted another chamber but poison gas was released so Indiana and the group had to abandon the search to seek fresh air and safety.
  </p>
  <p key="0abdb77e-4136-426a-8318-bfd3fd00eb73">
   To give the gas time to clear, Sallam was posted as a night watchman over the tomb's entrance and Indiana asked to help, but the man, while grateful, rejected the suggestion so Indiana retired for the evening. Sallam disappeared. Indiana joined the search the next day as the group re-entered the chambers and found that Kha was missing as well. Lawrence came across Sallam's charred body further on but deduced it was in fact a trauma to the head that killed the man. He was also covered in a unknown white powder. Collecting some, Lawrence couldn't see any motive so Indiana presented one person who might have an agenda: Kha.
  </p>
  <p key="251f8515-e12a-4ade-b6a0-8774ec47ba8e">
   Demetrios and the workers fled the site in panic while Indiana, Lawrence and Miss Seymour decided to investigate the tomb further which led them to the secret chamber containing a statue of Kha and more inscription that revealed the Egyptian had been rewarded a jewel encrusted
   Jackal headpiece
   by a Pharaoh for his services. Lawrence assumed that it was a part of the statue but Indiana told him it wasn't there. Closer inspection showed part had been broken off and Lawrence was sure they'd found the murderer's motive even if he couldn't understand where Kha himself went.
  </p>
  <p key="0c3add5a-8f76-4074-9abc-4677376b9cbd">
   The three ruled out the workers when Lawrence remembered the powder. By putting a flame to it, the puff of smoke that followed implied it was Duclos' flash powder. Indiana was woken the next morning by a hand clamped over his mouth. It was Lawrence, and he needed him stand guard while he searched Duclos' tent. Indiana kept an eye on the photographer walking through the site and followed him as Duclos went inside Kha's tomb. The camera flashed within the chambers and seeing Duclos may be heading back in his direction, Indiana ducked back inside an alcove. The wall behind creaked and he fell backwards into the upright body of Kha. The skeleton collapsed on top of him and, pinned to the floor, Indiana screamed fearing Duclos was coming to kill him.
  </p>
  <p key="63ac87f1-6aef-4778-99a9-b35b1687907b">
   Lawrence and Miss Seymour rushed in. His tutor pushed the body off him as Lawrence held Duclos against the wall with his gun. Duclos proclaimed his innocence in the murder of Sallam and revealed he was taking pictures within the tomb for the newspaper story. Lawrence questioned the magnesium powder recovered from Sallam's corpse to which Duclos pointed out that he was not the only who used it. Indiana looked at Kha and found it clutching a detonator plunger, revealing Demetrios as having embellished the curse inscription so he could steal the Jackal. Inside the demolitionist's tent, the four found the box for the plunger and powder used in flares, evidence in proving Demetrios' guilt.
  </p>
  <p key="2a1b3ae9-b508-465b-9767-65af57464f4d">
   Duclos lamented that the murderer and thief must be at the docks by that time, which Lawrence refused to believe. He quickly set out on his bicycle to intercept Demetrios while asking Indiana not to forget him, and promised to write.
   Nevertheless, Indiana, Miss Seymour and Duclos followed and caught up to find Lawrence holding Demetrios. But Demetrios had hidden the artifact, and managed to flee the country soon after. Indiana and his tutor reunited with Professor and Anna Jones, departing Egypt for the next leg of the tour:

   and while the adults conversed, Indiana was allowed to play outside with Keene assigning
   Omar
   , one of her slaves, to keep Jones company. During the game Indiana found he had to tell Omar not to let him win but complimented the boy on his English and discovered the boy didn't have to study like he. Jones considered the slave be lucky and Omar, like their game had been, accepted the point without argument.

   It was soon time for the family to move on to
   Ouezzane
   , where Professor Jones was due to give a lecture for the Moroccan Sultan. Indiana was disappointed their game was being cut short and Anna was unable to tell him if he would have anyone to play with there too. Hearing this predicament, the Sharifa allowed Omar to be Jones' playmate for the rest of their stay in the country.
  </p>
  <p key="2c8fbc8c-b67f-4746-91b8-2b0fac414088">
   For the seventy-five mile trip between cities, the boys talked. When Jones noted Morocco shared a similarity to Egypt, Omar, having never left the country, had to ask what that was. Jones explained which led to Indiana showing the slave his hand-drawn map and pointed out the countries and their differences in weather. The conversation brought up Jones' desire to be an archaeologist one day, another concept foreign to Omar. Indiana educated him further and asked what Omar was going to be. The slave replied that he would be just that, and was unable to abandon the role. It was with that that Indiana began to fully understand the concept.
  </p>
  <p key="d43020e3-fbb6-402a-8787-c379b79b42a1">
   His growing concerns about the nature of slavery prompted a discussion on the subject when the travelers took a rest on the journey. Miss Seymour made it clear to him that Omar, with regards to the Sharifa, was for all intents and purposes property. It prompted Jones to decide to go and help his friend attend to the horses, and he let Omar know that as far he was concerned the boy wasn't a slave around him.
  </p>
  <p key="c92263e3-b072-46a0-8098-97993b4eda39">
   The Joneses arrived in Ouezzane as guests in Harris' home. While Indiana was fetching something to eat, he spied a shrouded figure making his inside the building. Mistaking the man for a thief, the boy tried to rout him before he discovered the 'intruder' was none other than Harris himself. The journalist explained the Arab disguise allowed for easier movement around the marketplace, the natives less willing to confide in a European. His plans to meet with a grand vizier had been canceled having discovered the minister's severed head was on display for displeasing the sultan.

Ignoring the danger involved, he convinced Omar to join him and - Indy disguising himself like Harris had done - the pair headed for the busy marketplace.

   Bound and gagged within a small room, Indiana watched the slavers outside load
   camels
   with other children. He spied Omar sneaking to his rescue and managed to squeeze under the door to get his friend's attention. Omar undid the restraints but freedom, however, would be brief as the kidnappers caught the two as they made their escape. Indiana would get to experience the life of a slave first hand.

   The boys were loaded onto camels and taken far from the city. When the slavers set up camp to see the night through, Jones planned their escape. While most of the camp slept, the two tried to crawl their way to freedom. Suddenly the camp was assaulted by bandits and the slavers killed. Indiana mistook the attack for their salvation when in reality they were being stolen. The pair were loaded back onto the camels and taken all the way to

   Herded with other slaves, the boys were paraded around the potential buyers. Separated from Omar, Indiana's turn came to be put on auction and his good health started a bidding war between a black robed stranger and a
   man in yellow turban
   . The black robe eventually won out and Indiana was carried away to meet his new owner. Once again the figure unveiled himself to be Walter Harris, who had managed to track him to the city. Indiana was grateful for his rescue but discovered the journalist had no intention of saving Omar.
  </p>
  <p key="8707aa55-eb56-4bd2-bbcb-cbbb651919a1">
   Indiana refused to abandon his friend. Omar hadn't left him when he had the chance and Jones would do the same even if Omar would remain a slave regardless. Indiana and Harris returned to the auction just as bidding began on Omar. Harris was low on money — having spent most on Indiana — when he joined the bidding, and Harris' opponent from before saw it was the same man who had taken Jones from him. Another bidding war started but Jones quickly improvised, loudly protesting to his 'master' that Omar was mute. Since such an affliction would lower a slave's worth, Harris complained he did not want to pay so much for him. In response, the man in the yellow turban did not bid any further to force Omar onto his foe. As such, Harris won out and the three quickly left. The turban clad buyer followed and discovered he had been cheated. He sent men after them but the three escaped on horseback.

   With the Moroccan leg of the lecture over, the family returned to the Sharifa. Omar was to go back into the service of Keene so it was time for Indiana and his friend to say goodbye. Omar wished him luck on his quest to be an archaeologist and Indiana hoped he could one day show Omar the places he'd asked about. He decided to give Omar his map and, stopping Omar from bowing, the boys shook hands before going their separate ways.

   On the trip to the site, Indy was captivated by the beautiful countryside and its majestic animals. Upon arriving at camp, he hurriedly unpacked, anxious to meet his famous host. He was understandably disappointed when he found out that Roosevelt wouldn’t be back until nightfall. In the meantime, Medlicot showed Indy around the camp, introduced him to
   Heller
   , a taxidermist, and other members of the expedition. Left on his own, Indy wandered outside of camp. While exploring, he glimpsed a young African boy roughly his own age tending
   sheep
   . Before he had a chance to approach the boy, he was called back to camp.

  </p>
  <p key="dec01f24-a851-4f6a-ad8a-3a0f4bf93e3e">
   The next day, Roosevelt taught Indy to shoot a rifle. He also gave him a pair of binoculars to explore the surrounding countryside. He then left to go hunting. Later in the day, as Miss Seymour was teaching Indy about African wildlife, he vowed to find the oryx for Roosevelt. As he was exploring around the camp, he encountered the young tribal boy again. This time, Indy used basic sign language to introduce himself as "Indy." The boy introduced himself as
   Meto
   . Indy spent the rest of the afternoon with Meto, exploring and learning Meto's language.
  </p>
  <p key="24a49bd4-0aaf-41a9-987c-41866c5e0ef5">
   Later that day, Indy and Roosevelt had a discussion. Indy was disturbed by the number of animals that the hunting party had already killed. Roosevelt told Indy that the animals were going to museums so that people could appreciate nature more. After dinner and over a game of checkers, Indy told Roosevelt that he would help him find the oryx. Their discussion gets interrupted by a shot. Frederick Selous had killed a
   lion
   that was roaming just outside of camp. While the adults congratulated each other, Indy became more disturbed.

  <p key="91042d2c-7ca9-4eaa-80ae-d695f29144d3">
   The next day, Indy was up early and went to Meto for help in finding the oryx. Back at camp, he was missed and a search commenced. Meto took Indy to the
   Liabon
   who, through pictures drawn in the sand, described the fate of the oryx. Indy headed back to camp. As night fell, he made his way across the veldt, becoming increasingly scared of the animal noises emanating from the dark. He was finally found by one of the
   Askari
   guards.
  </p>
  <p key="4c409acc-bd4d-4025-9268-039c4bde71af">
   Taken back to camp, Indy was punished and not given a chance to explain. Early the next morning, Meto came to camp and he and Indy left before anyone else was awake. Meto took Indy to a place where there were oryxes. Indy then sneaked back to camp before breakfast. Over breakfast, Indy announced that he and Meto had found a small heard of oryx. Indy related the story he heard from the village elder to Roosevelt. The oryx's main food source was a root melon. Recently, a great fire had killed off most of the area's snake population. The snakes had controlled the population of mole rats. With no natural predators, the mole rats flourished and burrowed underground for food, eating the root melons. This forced the oryx herd to look for food elsewhere.
  </p>
  <p key="b5dfdf05-277c-4ed1-981a-40e296ef0490">
   Indy led Roosevelt and a hunting party to where the oryx herd was grazing. The party brought down two when Indy interceded, stating that there had been enough killing. Roosevelt agreed, stating that the oryx were rare and that they didn’t know what animals may depend on the oryx. Their job completed, the hunting party packed up and headed back to civilization. Indy left Meto a goodbye gift of his binoculars.

   </a>
   and
   Georges Braque
   were currently having a heated discussion about cubism. Degas was critiquing the work of Picasso. He didn't like Picasso's work and called it destructive. Picasso said that artists need a new way of seeing things. Degas warned Picasso not pursue this new line of work as it could ruin his career. Picasso scoffed at the warning, saying he could do what Degas does in his sleep. Norman leaped to defend Degas, saying that no one can paint like him.
  </p>
  <p key="043fc032-2d5d-4cdb-aa6a-a32f009a5844">
   Picasso invited Norman and Indy to his apartment to watch him prove his claim. There, Picasso posed his
   model
   and worked in pastel. As he worked, he explained to the boys Degas' technique. When he was finished, he tossed it aside and did the painting the way Degas would do it - from memory. Braque showed Norman some of Picasso's early experiments with cubism. Norman sketched some of it in his notebook. Even though the assistant rendered some of the paintings, he said that it is the painting and not the painter that is important. Picasso finished the
   painting
   and it indeed looked like a work of Degas'. Picasso saw the
   sketch
   in Norman's notebook and signed it. They decided to go somewhere and get something to eat.

  <p key="b71d5bca-9948-4fc9-9399-f1a862397e40">
   Meanwhile, Miss Seymour was frantic wondering where Indy was. She called the police, but has little confidence in the police inspector she dealt with. Along their way to a restaurant, Picasso invited along a couple of prostitutes. Indy thought that he should be heading back to the hotel, but Norman convinced him to stay. Picasso had the two prostitutes dance with Norman and Indy while he tried to devise a way to get Degas to sign his painting.
  </p>
  <p key="5b736b83-2d5d-44cf-953d-66edd8728194">
   A little later, the prostitutes' pimps showed up and confronted Picasso. A fight broke out, but Picasso, Braque, Indy and Norman managed to make it out. Later, Picasso was helping Indy with a paper on Da Vinci that he had to write for Miss Seymour. They also talked about his new style and how Picasso was trying to give spirit some form. Before they parted for the night, Picasso invited them to a party the next evening. As Indy and Norman walked back to the hotel, they were accosted by the same two pimps, who chased them into a
   cemetery
   . They managed to frighten them off by using an old sheet and a skull to make a "ghost."
  </p>
  <p key="a3e4bcc9-71e9-4c09-93b7-65708e2bc8a6">
   Back at the hotel, Indy sneaked past Miss Seymour and hid in the large wardrobe closet. The next morning, Miss Seymour found him there. Indy told her that he was there the whole time working on his paper and must have fallen asleep, but this only makes Miss Seymour more suspicious.

  <p key="00ba2656-efbb-4369-8693-a557fae0c6b7">
   The next night, Miss Seymour went to bed, but locked Indy in his room. He climbed out the window and was almost killed when the gutter he was hanging on gave way. He made it safely the rest of the way down and caught up to Norman outside the party. They went inside to find that everyone was wearing costumes. There, they met

   , to tell a ghost story. At the story's climax, in walked Miss Seymour, who woke and discovered that Indy was gone, but had written down where he was going. Picasso pulled out a gun and marched Miss Seymour into another room. Once there, Picasso sketched her. She liked the traditional portrait he had done of her, but was totally impressed with the cubist version he did as well. Miss Seymour was also shown Picasso's forgery. Kahnweiler saw it and, unaware that it is a forgery, wanted to buy it for a thousand francs. Picasso acted reluctant and said that it is not signed. Kahnweiler said that he'd get it signed.
  </p>
  <p key="30be428d-a642-4a66-a8c0-46e33417bc92">
   At the cafe, Kahnweiler got Degas, whose eyesight had begun to fail him and thought it was one of his paintings, to sign the painting. A delighted Picasso let everyone know that it was he who painted the picture not Degas. Kahnweiler became angry. Norman and Indy, thinking the trick Picasso played on Degas was a rotten one, denied the claim. Norman said that it looked like a Degas and it was signed by Degas, so therefore it must be one. Indy then sold Kahnweiler Norman's cubist sketch for a thousand francs which infuriated Picasso. He split the money with Norman and Picasso. Indy told Picasso that maybe he should stay around Paris and become his agent.

   Afterwards, they went to eat at a rather expensive hotel. Indy and Sophie went for a stroll in the hotel's greenhouse. Looking outside, they could see people skating on a frozen lake. Sophie said she had never tried skating, so Indy convinced her to do so. However, as Indy began to show her the ropes, Emilie arrived and took her away, furious. Indy was in big trouble. When his father found out he went mad and withdrew him from his riding lessons. Indy's mother was a bit more sympathetic. She explained to him that the imperial family had many enemies and what they did wasn't safe for Sophie. She told him that he'd make some other friends, but he responded that there was no one like her in the whole world.

Indy's spirits were raised and he spent the day looking for a small gift to give her. In one shop, he saw the perfect gift - a small glass globe with two ice skating figurines inside. However, it cost too much. He continued to wander through the city, and eventually spoiled a con man's shell game by showing the victim how it was done. The grateful man gave Indy some money and it was enough for him to go back to the shop and buy the glass globe. However, when he went to the palace to give it to Sophie, he was chased away by the guards.

   Later that night, Indy snuck out of the embassy and went to the palace. He refused to leave until he got to talk to the Archduke. Ultimately, he was taken to see him. He told the Archduke that he wished to marry Sophie when older and would like to say good-bye to her before he left in the morning. While the Archduke admired Indy's determination, he refused. He then arranged for a carriage to take Indy back to the embassy.

   Once the carriage dropped him off, it headed back to the palace, but Indy had managed to hide himself aboard. At the palace stables, he came out of his hiding place and entered the palace. He snuck through the halls, dodged the guards, and used dumbwaiters and a discovered secret passage to get to Sophie's room. She was happy to see him and gave him a gift of a locket with her picture. Indy gave her the globe and told her that he was in love with her. They kissed briefly and he said good-bye. He climbed down the balcony and snuck off the palace grounds as she waved goodbye. Jones would keep Sophie's locket for a long time, and he would later use it as a good luck-charm.

   of Pisa with two irons, one heavier than the other. Miss Seymour asked him which will hit the ground first if they were to drop them both at the same time. Indy replied that the heavier one would. Miss Seymour told him that that was what
   Aristotle
   thought, but Galileo believed they would both hit the ground at the same time due to the fact that they had the same density. Indy proved this by dropping the weights which did indeed hit at the same time. Puccini asked Indy's mother about her life. He told her about how he came to realize that he was destined to write operas about love and beauty. He told her, however, that an artist can only create the approximation of beauty, never the real thing. He went on to tell her about the problems he has with his marriage.

   , and witnessed an argument between Puccini and one of the singers. Puccini told them that a singer alone could not portray his emotions; he needed an actress also. Puccini gave Indy's mother a piece of the sheet music from the opera signed, "To Senora Jones, who feels the music." He then offered to show them around Florence tomorrow. That night Indy's mother explained to him how music is a special language that can convey a wide range of emotions. The next day, Indy's mother enjoyed the guided tour of Florence. While alone, Puccini confessed to Indy's mother that he felt that they were connected and should be together, however, she told him that she was married and no matter what her feelings were for him, they must speak no further of it. She asked him to take them back to the house.

   The following day at breakfast, Indy asked his mother what was bothering her. She seemed upset that she hadn't received a reply from his father in the mail. Indy told her that he’d be back the following night. They decided to go sight seeing on their own that day, however, Puccini tracked them down. Miss Seymour steered Indy away from them so his mother and Puccini could speak in private. Puccini apologized to her, but said he could not stay away. He said he wanted to work with her in his sight because she had revitalized his passion. She was extremely distraught over the feelings she had for him and asked to be left alone. Indy interrupted them as he realized something was going on. Puccini asked her to meet him in the botany gardens that evening. She refused, but he said he would wait until she came.

   That evening, Indy's mother left him and Miss Seymour to take a walk. She met Puccini in the garden and they kissed passionately. They spent the evening walking together throughout Florence. They arrived back at the opera house where Puccini's play was opening. The play was a success and he walked her back to the house. Miss Seymour spotted them from her window as they kissed. Miss Seymour confronted her when she came inside and asked if she was still planning on leaving Florence for Paris when Professor Jones returned. She said yes, but was obviously still considering staying. The next day, Indy and Miss Seymour were visiting the science museum while his mother went shopping. Indy said that he had noticed that his mother had been acting strange which she didn’t seem to do when his father was around. He wished that his father had written his mother a letter. Looking through a telescope at the street below he spotted his mother having lunch with Puccini. Puccini asked Anna to come away with him. She said it was too fast, but he told her that the train leaves at midnight. She ran from him in confusion.

   That night Indy asked his mother about her "shopping" earlier that day and asked if she saw Puccini. She said she ran into him while shopping. Indy went to bed and Anna began crying. Miss Seymour tried to comfort her, but she explained how confused she was concerning Puccini. She told Miss Seymour that Puccini wanted her to go away with him as Indy listened at the door to his room. She told Miss Seymour that she did love him, but Miss Seymour warned her that passion always burns brightest at first and that Puccini had no right to ask her to give up everything for him. Anna admitted that she did still love her husband and didn't want to think of leaving him or Indy, but she was electrified when she was with Puccini. That night Anna went to the train station and walked past Puccini to greet her husband. She told him how much she had missed him and told him she wanted to always stay together. Puccini walked away heartbroken.

   During
   1909
   , for his tenth birthday, Indy was given an archery set by his father. Henry put up a target, and told Indy to practice, and said that when he got a bulls-eye he'd go and tell him. Indy practiced the whole afternoon, and when Henry came out to see how it all had went, Indy told him that he simply couldn't hit it. Henry then told him that the problem was that he didn't believe that he could hit it. Indy told himself that he could do it, and as a result he hit the target. Henry's lesson was to teach Indy not to become cynical.
   Indy's mischievous nature would also manifest itself during the family's travels, such as in
   St. Petersburg
   when he painted a statued pig purple, and in

He leaned against a cart with crystal on it which sent it crashing into a passing waiter. Indy's father took him out into the hall to reprimand him. He told Indy that he was to stand in the hall and not move, however, Indy disobeyed him. As he walked into an adjoining room, he brushed against a handle attached to the rope a huge chandelier was hanging from. The handle came unlocked and the chandelier crashed down onto the wedding cake. Indy's parents looked on in disbelief and his mother brought him to his room. Indy apologized to his mother, but she told him that his father would deal with him in the morning. Indy, feeling he was being treated unfairly, climbed down a gutter drain outside his window and ran away.

   The next morning, Miss Seymour woke Indy's parents to tell them that Indy was gone. Indy's father began to search for him. Indy, sleeping in a haystack, was awoken by a small weasel. He tried to shoot it with his slingshot, but hit
   an old man
   who was also sleeping in the haystack. The old man advanced on him swinging a stick and yelling in Russian. Indy said that he didn't speak Russian, so the man started yelling at him in English. The man said how he hated young people and walked off with Indy's slingshot. Indy followed him trying to get his slingshot back. The man told him to stop following him, but Indy refused. The man gave him back his slingshot and told him to get off his side of the road.

  <p key="d1c10a98-8ef0-4fb3-911b-f7b7e2d0bcaa">
   Indy walked with the old man (on his side of the road) and explained how he was running away back to America. When Indy questioned why the man didn't want to turn Indy into his parents the man said that he never did what he was supposed to do and he was also running away. Indy didn't believe him because he was old. The man asked him if he thought only little boys were driven crazy by their parents.

   Meanwhile, Indy's parents were getting extremely worried about him. Indy asked the man if he was going to miss anyone. The man said he would miss his dogs. Indy said he missed his dog also. Indy's sole came off his boot and the man said he'll fix it. The man showed Indy his prize possession, his bible. Indy showed him his baseball mitt and ball. He explained to him the basics of the game and showed him his baseball card collection. Indy said he wouldn't give up his prize card for all of the gold in China. The man said he felt the same way about his bible.

   With Indy's boot fixed, the two continued on their way. They began to feel hungry and Indy started eating the apple he brought with him. He offered the man one bite, but the man managed to eat half of the apple with his one bite. Indy complained, but the man told him that things should be divided each according to his needs. Since he was bigger than Indy, he required more. Indy stated that it was his apple, but the man said that it grew on a tree in the ground and belonged to the world. Indy said he would never share anything with him again.

   The two continued on in silence as it began to thunder. Indy's father said that he should never have brought Indy along on his trip through Europe. Indy and the man reached a village and the villagers rushed to great the man yelling, "Tolstoy!" Indy was amazed at how friendly the people were to Tolstoy. The villagers welcomed "Count" Tolstoy into their inn and gave him food to eat. Indy watched from the window as rain began to pour down on him. Tolstoy yelled at him to get inside and stop making him feel guilty. Once Indy finished the meal he asked if Tolstoy was some kind of king in disguise. Tolstoy told him that he wrote a few books years ago, but they weren't very good. He told Indy that he was running away to nowhere in particular. He just wanted a simpler life, closer to God. Indy told him he can run away to New Jersey with him and Tolstoy agreed.

In the confusion, he and Tolstoy escaped. Indy's father became increasingly worried about the dangers that Indy might have encountered and blamed himself for Indy running away. As Indy and Tolstoy hid in a barn, they watched as Imperial Cossack troops rode by. Tolstoy told him that they were ruthless and were used by the government to rid themselves of "certain unfortunate ethnic groups."

   Tolstoy said they should head for the train station. On the way, they stopped so Indy could teach Tolstoy about baseball. Indy said it's too bad Tolstoy wasted all those years writing because he could have been a great hitter. A group of gypsies passed by and gave the two of them a ride. That night, Tolstoy told everyone a scary story around the campfire. While they all danced around the campfire, the Cossacks attacked, killing many of the gypsies. Tolstoy was knocked down by a Cossack on a horse, but Indy rescued him. The two fled as the camp was set on fire.
Indy brought Tolstoy to a church, but the monk tries to throw them out thinking they were beggars. Indy told him that the man was Tolstoy and they tried to help him. As Tolstoy awoke he realized where he was and ran out. He told Indy that they drove people away from God and he'd sooner die than receive help from them. Tolstoy fell unconscious in a field nearby and Indy screamed for help. Some men heard him and brought Tolstoy inside their house.
The next day, Indy asked Tolstoy why he hated the church so much. He said that they diminished God by claiming to speak for him. He told Indy not to try to see God through spectacles borrowed from the church, but instead through his own eyes. Meanwhile, Miss Seymour wasn't feeling well from all of the worry. Indy's father just wished he could talk to him and began crying.

   Indy and Tolstoy arrived at the train station just as the train left. Indy noticed that Tolstoy was not doing too well. He told him that he didn't think he was up to the trip. Tolstoy got angry as Indy told him that he thought he should return to his family. Tolstoy agreed to go as long as Indy would return to his family as well. Indy's father and mother were looking in on Miss Seymour who was bedridden when a hotel clerk knocked at the door to tell them that Indy had been found. Indy's mother made his father promise that he wouldn’t be too hard on him.
Indy's parents arrived at Tolstoy's estate and were reunited with Indy. Indy apologized for running away. Before he could accept, Indy's father spotted Tolstoy and was amazed. Indy introduced his parents to Tolstoy. After they left, Tolstoy went inside to rest. Indy's mother askd where Indy got the bible he had. Indy said he traded Tolstoy his baseball card collection for it. Tolstoy took out the baseball cards and enthusiastically read through them. Indy and his parents left Russia for

   Upon reaching the site of
   Aristotle's theater
   , Indy's father gave instructions to the cab driver in ancient Greek, but Indy wasn't sure that he understood properly. Indy's father told Indy that this was the birthplace of Philosophy and explained to him the fundamentals of it. He told him of Aristotle's teachings of logic in a system called syllogism. He demonstrated by using a stick as a sword and acting out a fight. He fell to the floor seemingly dead. As Indy rushed to his side, he jumped up and said that all men are mortal which is a general truth. He is a man, ergo he is mortal which is a specific truth. He then said that
   Socrates
   was a man, ergo Socrates was mortal which is a syllogism. This, he told Indy, was an example of Aristotelian logic and that deductive logic is the key that will unlock the great mysteries of our universe and our very existence. The questions that
   Aristotle
   asked marked a turning point in the history of mankind. These thoughts set us apart from all the other creatures in the world.

  <p key="3ebb9de8-1866-415c-8e82-b85b9daf5d74">
   They then went to leave, but Indy found that the cab was gone. His father pointed to a cab and said that that is logically their cab. Their cab was parked there; this cab was parked there now; ergo that was their cab. They got in the cab and took off. They soon realized that the driver was not the same and they were kicked out of the cab. They began trekking to the monastery on foot. On the way, Indy's father continued to lecture to Indy about the ancient Greeks.

   Eventually a horse and buggy approached and they managed to get a ride. Indy's father tried to continue lecturing over the sounds of the chickens in the buggy and another
   rider's wind flute
   . They were dropped off still far away from the monastery looking completely disheveled. They bathed in the ocean to clean up, however, a group of goats ate holes in their clothes. They arrived in a nearby village wearing nothing, but pieces of a bush and managed to get some very "native" looking clothes from the peasants. They managed to get a lift from a man named Aristotle whose donkey pulling the cart was named
   Plato

   Aristotle asked Indy's father if he was interested in politics. When his father said no, Aristotle called him an idiot. Indy was shocked, however, his father explained that the English word "idiot" comes from a Greek word meaning "one who is not interested in politics." Indy's father and Aristotle soon got into an argument about democracy. Indy's father said that Greece was the home of democracy. He explained Plato and Aristotle's system of government. The three began getting confused about what they were arguing about since Indy's father was constantly talking about what Aristotle and Plato said and the driver kept thinking he was talking about him and his donkey. Aristotle kicked Indy's father, "the raving democrat," out of the buggy. Indy's father walked alongside while Indy refused to get out of the cab. He said that if this was really a democracy like his father argued then he could stay in the cab if he wanted to.

   They eventually arrived at the hanging monastery which was situated at the top of a mountain and got into a cage which would be raised up the side of the mountain by the monks above. On the trip up Indy noticed the height was bothering his father who was sitting completely still. They were greeted by the monks and told that the following day the monks would be cloistered and would keep a vow of silence for the following two days.
After dinner, they were shown to their room which was basically a closet with one hard bed. The next day, Indy watched the monks as they chanted. He then went to the library and tried to keep quiet while his father translated texts. He told his father that he was bored. His father's solution was to make Indy look up Aristotle's laws of syllogism and write three pages on the nature of Aristotelian logic and its relation to causality. Indy found the books his father referred him to and began to read through them.

  <p key="4804aefd-bd12-4c45-aaf2-08cd6358e942">
   Indy met
   Nikos Kazantzakis
   was also studying the texts at the monastery. He looked at the assignment Indy's father gave him and decided to help him out. He explained that Aristotle said that nature does not act without a cause; which sprang from his theory of causality. He demonstrated this by having Indy give a push to an orange set atop some books. He stated that there were many factors that caused the orange to fall: the essence of the orange (its weight), the structure of the orange (it is round), the fact that Indy pushed it, and finally, that it's function included seeking the lowest level. Indy interpreted this last factor to be gravity, but Nikos said that the function of the orange is to fall from the tree to make another orange. Indy wrote in his paper what Nikos explained him, but he asked what causes nature? Nikos said that this is a question that comes from wisdom and not logic. He said that this is the question that Indy's father wanted him to find. He said God, the prime cause, dances beyond the bounds of logic. He said that wisdom is greater than logic, but it leaves you asking whether you can accept something as being true without proof.
  </p>
  <p key="826c81ec-d769-4edd-9fb5-c93ff37c1dd7">
   Later in the day, Indy and his father said goodbye to the monks at the elevator cage. The monks headed off to begin their vow of silence and Indy gave his father his report. They boarded the cage and began to be lowered down. Indy's father read the report on the way down and said it was good although he didn't agree that wisdom is greater than logic. The cage stopped and Indy's father stepped out to find that they were only halfway down. He managed to grab hold of the cage as he fell and climbed back in. Indy began to suspect the worst, thinking that the monks had stranded them there so they would starve to death. They yelled for help, however, no one answered. The sun began to set and the temperature starts dropping. They started a small fire using pieces of wood from the cage, however the cage itself caught on fire. While trying to put out the fire, Henry accidentally broke a hole in the floor of the elevator.
  </p>
  <p key="414e760b-070c-40b9-b0b6-17e6524d7cd7">
   The next morning, they began to doubt that the monks would find them and tried to devise a plan on how to save themselves. Indy's father attempted to climb up the rope that the cage was hanging from, but only got a few feet before his fear of heights froze him in place. He slid back down the rope and burned his hands in the process. The rope then began to fray. Indy said they needed to be logical to get out of the predicament. He reasoned a ladder is made of wood and the cage was made of wood; ergo their cage was a ladder. They broke off pieces of wood and rope and made individual ladder rungs that could be fastened to the rope above and then unfastened once they had climbed above each rung. Indy's father made it past the part of the rope that was fraying and barely managed to grab hold of Indy and the rope snapped and the cage plummeted to the ground. They reached the top of the mountain cliff and found that the monk working the pulley controlling the cage was knocked unconscious when the pulley fell from the roof. Indy and his father laughed as the tension was released and shared a hug. Relieved that their ordeal was over, the two traveled back to Athens, deciding not to share the details of the adventure with Anna and Miss Seymour, but exclaiming through a syllogism that they had a great time together as father and son.

Ah Pin would lose face if it were revealed he was tricked. He told Indy that he acted well and didn't need the approval of others. They got a new horse and proceeded on their trip.

   As they continued across the country in the wagon, Indy started to become sicker and was soon running a fever. Storm clouds started to gather and they decided to head for a nearby mission.

They told Mrs. Jones that the nearest American doctor was three days away at the mission, but there was a local Chinese doctor. Mrs. Jones didn't trust the local doctor. The next day, Mr. Li told them that even though the family is poor, they were glad to host them until Indy was better. Hospitality was very important to the Chinese. Indy's condition continued to worsen. They managed to get the cart fixed, but Indy was too sick to travel. Ah Pin and Miss Seymour sat out to the American mission for the doctor.

Mrs. Jones was determined that their son was not going to die and sent for the Chinese doctor. He arrived the next day and examined Indy. He decided that Indy had to be treated with acupuncture. A delirious Indy became upset and this bothered his mother. The Chinese mother tried to comfort her. Mrs. Jones held Indy's hand throughout the procedure and told him to trust in the doctor. As he applied the needles,
   Dr. Wen Ch-Iu
   explained what he was doing. Mr. Li translated for him. When he was done, he said that Indy would recover if his strength would hold.

Morton said that Indy probably had Typhoid Fever, but was getting better. Ah Pin also found some of their luggage. As Indy regained his strength, he spent time playing Chinese checkers with the children and learning their language. A few days later, the man on the donkey returned. Mr. Li explained that the father had to borrow money and used the land as collateral. The debt was now due, but he couldn't pay. Mrs. Jones decided to pay the debt out of gratitude, but Mr. Li said that the father would lose face. She said that she owed them something for all of their hospitality.

   The next day Indy and Nancy loaded their bikes onto a train and journeyed to West Orange. When they arrived at the laboratory, Indy's eyes lit up when he saw a car whipping around a test track. Thompson took the generator into one of the labs to an assistant. While Indy was talking to the test car driver, a cry came from the lab. Indy and Nancy rushed inside to find that Thompson had been kidnapped by three men in a van. They also knocked out his assistant and stole some plans. The police arrived and the officer in charge was a
   Detective Frank Brady
   . The assistant told Brady that the kidnappers were speaking German and he repeated the phrase that he heard. Brady translated it as "Quick, the baby's burping," Indy suggested that it might have been "Quick, the chicken is burping," but that made no sense either. Brady told Indy to butt out and that he wouldn’t get the generator back until after the case was solved.
   Thomas Edison
   arrived and the assistant told him that certain Naval Research files on a submarine detection system and the files on the car battery had been stolen. Edison was more concerned with the stolen files than with Thompson's well being and told Brady to contact Naval Intelligence.
  </p>
  <p key="251cb7e3-6073-4821-96b3-a1150024950a">
   As Indy and Nancy walked their bikes back to the train station, Indy realized that the German phrase could also be translated to "Quick, the chicken farm." Nancy remembered seeing a chicken farm on the train ride in. They biked to it and there, they found the kidnappers' van covered in straw. There was also some oil stuck on the fender and a partial sticker with the letter groupings "IL," "CH" and "RY." In the loft of the barn they found Dr. Thompson tied up and called the police. Thompson told them that he had to co-operate or they would have killed him. He also heard the Germans mentioning the high and low tides and believed that they were being picked up in a submarine. Nancy and Indy rode back to the train station, not noticing two sinister men parked on the side of the road.

  <p key="9ae540f2-2275-406e-90ae-484d62237e24">
   That night as Indy was having supper at Nancy's, he discussed the kidnapping with her father. They figured that the van was probably stolen from wherever the Germans landed. The next day at school, Nancy told Indy that she figured that the Germans landed near the oil refineries at
   Bayonne
   and she said she would be going out to investigate. After school, Nancy left for Bayonne, but Indy was held after class. As soon as he could, he followed her, finding her in the dunes along the beach. They picked a spot to hide and wait. High tide came and went, but no German sub showed up. Instead, they spotted two men with guns who turned out to be Brady and another officer.
  </p>
  <p key="6b9aef7a-4848-4735-a9b4-386f445accf7">
   That night at supper, Indy had a stroke of inspiration. He called Nancy and told her that it wasn't Germans who were after the submarine plans, but the oil companies after the battery plans. They met and headed out to the refinery. They sneaked in and overheard some men discussing Edison's battery. They also found the plans and learned that the letter groupings from the van were part of the phrase "oIL researCH laboratoRY." As they sneaked out, the theft of the plans was discovered. They were spotted by the two sinister men from the chicken farm who gave chase. Indy handed the plans to Nancy and told her to go to the police. Indy headed off their pursuers and was able to trick them into driving their car off a pier. The police showed up and arrested the two men. Brady allowed Indy and Nancy to take the plans back to Dr. Thompson themselves.

   The next day at Edison Labs, Indy and Nancy told Thompson about how they deduced who had stolen the plans. Nancy grew suspicious when Thompson talked about the oil refinery since Indy never mentioned the refinery. When they confronted him with this, he made a run for it, stealing the experimental car. Indy and Nancy gave chase in an old Model T. They managed to catch up with him after Indy took a short cut across an old rickety bridge, forcing him off the road just as the police arrive. When asked why he did it, Thompson said that he wanted credit for the work he did on Edison's various projects. When Edison received the plans back from Indy and Nancy, he graciously rebuilt the Bugatti's generator. They arrived at the prom in style and Indy was able to show up Butch.

   Days later the rebels headed out with a train to attack Ciudad Guerrero. The attack went according to plan until Pershing staged a counterattack which forced the rebels to retreat. That night as the rebels hid from Pershing's men, Villa decided to attack William Randolph Hurst's Mexican hacienda. This, he hoped, would put Mexican President Carranza in a bad position with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. They took the hacienda easily as there was no one there.

   At the pool, Sean and Indy discussed Indy's reasons for fighting in the war. Sean said that Ireland must be free, that home rule while swearing allegiance to the King of England was not enough. Sean got upset and left, taking Maggie with him. The next day, Sean and O'Casey were having an argument out on a sidewalk. O'Casey didn't want to hear anymore about the Irish Volunteers from Sean. Sean started to walk off as Indy happened by. He warned Indy not to see Maggie anymore, but Indy paid him no heed.

    Battle of the Somme
   </a>
   , in August 1916, was one of the deadliest battles ever fought. As a corporal, Indy was the highest ranking member of his unit. The French commander was not keen on loaning the company any of his existing lieutenants so he promoted a French sergeant,
   Moreau
   , to lieutenant and placed him in command of Indy's unit. Moreau had some suspicions about one of the soldiers, a troublemaker named
   Jacques
   . Indy told him that he suspected Jacques was the one who killed their commander.

  <p key="052362ef-3239-4304-82ec-e2ba1683b939">
   Orders came down to recapture the Chateau La Maisonette, with the Belgian company leading the charge. The attack commenced on schedule, but the men were soon pinned down in foxholes by machine gun fire. Indy and Moreau managed to get some grenades to some men who were closest to the gunners, who used them to knock out the machine gun nests. The charge continued. The soldiers met the Germans in the first trench and hand-to-hand fighting began. The Belgians were able to force the Germans to retreat. The troops worked quickly to secure the trench. They received a communiqué that they were the only group to make it to the trench. Jacques provoked a fight with Indy which Moreau broke up.
  </p>
  <p key="df3cd8f1-f932-4231-8c88-434d99e6285a">
   The troops were preparing for the second stage of the offensive when the Germans attacked with gas. Indy was forced to watch helplessly as a comrade who lost his gas mask in the charge died horribly. An eerie silence descended on the battlefield. Then the Germans slowly began their advance through the haze with a terrifying new weapon - the flame thrower. The Belgians retreated back to their own trenches, the entire offensive a failure.

   Later, orders came down granting the company a two day leave. They headed for a nearby town where the men were able to bathe, wash their uniforms and unwind. Indy and another soldier challenged a pair of British soldiers to a game of tennis, but lost. After the game, Indy and the two British lieutenants,
   Robert Graves
   and
   Siegfried Sassoon
   , had a couple of beers and discussed literature.

  <p key="faae4d54-a3fb-4054-9dda-14cd6a5f4014">
   When the company got back to the front, they were informed that a new attack was to be mounted on the chateau. The charge began and the Belgians took the first trench easily. Indy let Jacques know that Moreau suspected him of killing their officers. They charged the second trench but found it empty. Before the charge could continue, they were pinned down again by machine gun fire. Moreau decided to use an abandoned German tunnel to try to outflank the German gunners. Moreau, Indy and Jacques sneaked into the tunnel but were attacked by a German soldier. Indy was able to sneak up on him and kill him with a bayonet.
  </p>
  <p key="1b9a4acf-0dcd-454d-af4f-a4923cf28b04">
   Once through the tunnels, they found that they were behind the machine gun nests, which they took out with grenades. The rest of the troops charged and took the chateau. Later, Moreau was anxious as no reinforcements had arrived. He couldn't hold their position with only thirty men. Without warning, the Germans attacked, killing Moreau. In the confusion, Indy saw Remy wounded, but couldn't get to him. Jacques saved Indy from an attacking German and informed him that even though he didn't kill their captain, his saving Indy didn't make them friends. He was then suddenly shot dead by the Germans. As German soldiers overran the chateau, the Belgian soldiers retreated. Indy, however, was captured and taken prisoner.

While the prisoners were being transferred, the Allies started an artillery barrage. Taking advantage of the confusion, Indy and Emile tried to escape. Unfortunately they unwittingly seeked cover in a foxhole filled with German soldiers. They were recaptured and sent to a prisoner of war camp.

   Upon arrival, Indy and Emile began to walk around, checking the layout. A prisoner kicked a ball too close to a fence and was almost shot by the guards as he attempted to retrieve it. Indy validated the man's story that it was an accident to a skeptical guard. The prisoner introduced himself to Indy and Emile as
   Captain
   Jean Benet
   and took them to a meeting of French officers who were planning an escape. The officers had run into a problem with the tunnel they were digging - they were out of tunnel supports and places to hide the dirt. Benet suggested one concentrated effort to finish the tunnel in one night. They agreed and Indy and Emile helped out. Although they first miscalculated the distance to the outside, they finally completed the tunnel.

   As the men prepared to leave, the commandant came into the barracks on a surprise inspection. He almost discovered the tunnel, but Benet distracted him by provoking a fight. Benet was thrown into isolation, but the commandant did not discover the tunnel. The rest of the French officers moved through the tunnel. Indy and Emile brought up the rear but were spotted by the Germans as they left the tunnel. Emile was shot and Indy was recaptured.

   Dusterstadt

   Yuri
   and
   Leonid
   , who wanted to know if he could throw a lasso just like a real American cowboy. They wanted his help with an escape plan of theirs. They had made a rope from all of the package string they had collected and would use it in their escape. Indy had his doubts, but agreed to go along anyway.
  </p>
  <p key="4ba50c0f-33ce-4751-9db8-81913f8951d2">
   The following evening, Indy joined the Russians. Their plan called for Indy to lasso a spike on top of a building bordering the castle. They would then climb across and down the side of the wall to freedom. Indy managed to lasso the spike, but the Russians tried to cross the rope at the same time, causing it to break and plunging them into the river to their deaths. The next morning, the German commander reprimanded all of the prisoners. He brought out two body bags containing Yuri and Leonid to be displayed for all to see.

  <p key="72fc1745-b74c-48c4-9492-4f4b8129021a">
   Indy and de Gaulle hatched a plan to escape in the two Russians' coffins. They enlisted Lambert and his two orderlies into the plot. As per regular procedure, the orderlies would take the coffins to a graveyard on the shore to be buried. However, they would only put an inch of dirt on top of the coffins so Indy and de Gaulle could dig out easily. The German guards were superstitious so they wouldn't enter the cemetery and find out what was going on.

   All went according to plan until the orderlies reached the shore. They were informed of a change in procedure; the bodies were to be cremated not buried. The orderlies had no choice but to load the coffins on the truck and head back to the island. Indy and de Gaulle escaped from the truck before it reached the crematorium and set off across the countryside.

   Indy returned to the command late at night with the news from the front. The report reached the generals who were dining in rather elegant surroundings. Nivelle was furious with the results. Meanwhile, Indy and the other couriers tried to figure out the reasons the war was being fought in the first place, but without a satisfactory answer. Indy was just disgusted with the whole affair.

   The next day Indy received word that Remy had been wounded and went to visit him at a nearby hospital. Remy confided in Indy that he was afraid of going back to the front, but Indy managed to convince him that if he refused to go he'd be shot by a firing squad. Later, Indy was enroute to the front with a message when he was attacked by a German bi-plane. Indy was blown off his motorbike by a bomb and the plane left him for dead. When Indy returned to headquarters, all the couriers were asked as to who speaks German. Indy replied that he did. He was promptly assigned on a mission to spy on the Germans.

   That evening, Indy crawled across no man's land and took up a position listening outside a German command bunker. There he overheard that the Germans had two Big Berthas, large howitzers, on the way. Before he could learn anymore, he was discovered and barely managed to escape. Indy gave his report to Barc who then took him to General Nivelle. Nivelle didn't believe Indy and ordered an attack readied. Petain argued with Nivelle, saying that they should try to confirm Indy's report. Nivelle ignored him.

  <p key="f0794336-55c4-4038-8c6c-543ec54550e6">
   The next morning, Indy saw troops heading out towards the front with Remy among them. The two friends spoke, knowing that it might have been the last time they ever saw each other. Petain ordered an aerial reconnaissance which confirmed Indy's report. He tried to persuade Nivelle to call off the attack, but Nivelle said that he was under orders from Joffre. Petain took it upon himself to send written orders to the front calling off the attack. When Joffre found out, he was furious. He called Colonel Barc at the front to reinstate the attack. Barc said that he couldn't until he had a written countermanding order. Joffre quickly wrote one out and gave it to Indy to deliver. Petain asked what military objective could be gained by attacking, and Joffre explained to Petain that there was none; it was a political objective. Joffre said that the fort they were attacking was a symbol of national pride, and the public was shaken when the Germans captured it. The politicians, therefore, were dealing with the public by ordering Joffre to retake the fort. Petain found it all repugnant.

As he went upstairs, he was watched by a suspicious looking man in the lobby.
  </p>
  <p key="c9a7d85c-4298-417a-8331-1688dacfb56b">
   The next morning, the watcher was still there when she came back to find him asleep on the couch. She woke him up and they called room service for breakfast. Things got cozier and they made love. Afterwards, she told him that he seemed to be untouched by the horrors of war and that he should go to Africa where it was safer. That afternoon, they went for a walk, unaware that they were being followed. She told him to try and forget the war while he was on leave. He told her that he loved her. They saw some artists and Mata Hari told Indy that she'd always wanted to create something that would get people to talk. Perhaps that was why she danced. Indy wanted to spend the evening with her, but she had a dinner party to go to. They made plans to meet afterwards.
  </p>
  <p key="de80235d-98da-42ef-93b0-6c0f0b933ed7">
   Later, Indy met Remy at a café. He was there with two prostitutes. Indy apologized for being late, saying that he'd been having a hard time getting away. They figured out that he was in love. That evening, Indy went to Mata Hari's hotel room to wait for her. He found some pictures of her with other men and a beautiful engraved silver jewelry box that was a gift from a wealthy count. When she finally returned at dawn, Indy was upset and asked who she was with all night. She thought that he was being unreasonable as they had only known each other forty-eight hours. She calmed him down and they made love.
  </p>
  <p key="3eaa7cf3-7dc7-42bf-9b91-69c3640ce5b0">
   Later, she told him that she had to move out of her country house as it had become too expensive to maintain. She needed to go out and supervise the workmen putting her things in storage and asked Indy to accompany her. As they sorted through some things, Indy found some of her old costumes and admitted he never saw her dance. She changed and performed a highly erotic dance for him that ended with them in bed. Afterwards, she had to run some errands and left Indy in charge of the movers. They made plans to meet that evening.
  </p>
  <p key="301a90cb-a50e-455b-bcfe-b31fded1bc6d">
   The movers gave Indy a ride back to the hotel, but he just missed her. He found an address on her dressing table and went there to find her having dinner with another man. As they left, he followed them, unaware that he was also being followed. They went down to a rather shady area of Paris, where Mata Hari took her gentleman into an apartment building. He climbed up the side of the building to a window and peered in. When he saw them kiss, Indy lost his footing and fell into a pile of garbage below.
  </p>
  <p key="b6dc900d-ebf4-49b8-b74f-e38180a60968">
   Indy got up and spotted his shadower and attacked him. The other man's partner came out and they placed Indy under arrest. At police headquarters, Indy was in big trouble. They questioned him about his false name and age on his enlistment papers. They thought he might be a spy. They also asked him about his time with Mata Hari. He told them that he hadn't talked about the war. He tried to ask them what it was all about, but they wouldn't say. They told him to stay away from her and that his leave was canceled. He had twenty-four hours to report back to his unit.
  </p>
  <p key="5ee8d0e7-8035-46d3-979b-64a622513c55">
   Indy went to Mata Hari’s hotel room, angry, and told her what happened. She was unconcerned whether they thought she was a spy or not since she had friends in high places who would help her. Indy told her that he felt like he had been used and they argued. Mata Hari told Indy that he was too young to really know what was going on in their relationship. He told her that he had to go back to the front in he morning. She softened, feeling genuinely sad and asked him to stay the night. Later, he got up, dressed and left to return to his unit before she woke up.

   . Upon their arrival in November, they received promotions to lieutenant. They were assigned to a unit stationed at Lake Victoria in
   Nairobi
   . However, they boarded the wrong train and ended up in Moshi. They got directions for the right train, but still managed to board another wrong train. The second train broke down and the engineer set off to bring back a repair crew. Unfortunately, this would take about a week.
  </p>
  <p key="93e597da-0de3-422a-b31d-e2e3a7711999">
   Consulting a map, Indy found another line running parallel to them ten miles east. He and Remy headed out. While admiring the beautiful sunset, Remy realized that they had been heading in the wrong direction. As they tried to make their way back to the train, they found an allied camp staffed entirely by old soldiers. Indy and Remy asked to see the commanding officer who turned out to be none other than Captain
   <a href="Frederick Selous.html" key="8efabf76-49a1-4343-9a5e-243fa5bec5a6" title="Frederick Selous">
    Frederick Selous

   at age nine. Indy explained to him the situation and Selous promised to take him to his commanders, General Jan Christian Smuts and Colonel
   Richard Meinertzhagen
   , and explain the situation.
  </p>
  <p key="892f91f5-2230-4612-a607-043ab6b3e5b7">
   Selous took Indy and Remy to a section of the front lines that was under heavy bombardment. Meinertzhagen figured that the Germans had a battleship cannon mounted on a railway flatcar. Before he realized what had happened, Indy found himself "volunteered" by Selous to be part of a group called the
   Old and the Bold
   that was to find the train and destroy it. The other members of the group included
   Birdy Soames
   , naval expert,
   Bill MacMillan
   , demolitions expert,
   Mr. Golo
   , an expert native tracker,
   Zoltan
   , a mechanic and
   Donald Parks
   , strategist. Selous was in command. Remy was furious when Indy told him and was convinced that they would both be shot as deserters.
  </p>
  <p key="b50dc224-a7da-4559-8ddf-dae817a0cd71">
   The group sat out on horseback. That evening, they made camp. Selous admitted to Indy that they didn't have much of a plan, and that they would just improvise. The Germans began shelling and Selous timed the shells' flights, estimating a location for the rail line. That morning, Indy accidentally got the explosives wet. Big Mac was furious, but said everything should be all right even though he was not sure about the detonator caps.
  </p>
  <p key="63559254-8690-4878-a865-8186adedf467">
   They sat out and soon found a German camp sat up along some rail lines. Waiting until dark, they walked right into the camp, posing as drunken soldiers. They split up and Indy was sent off to steal toilet paper. He also stole a car with Bernie. They met the others outside of camp. They had procured a railway handcart. Indy and Bernie were given the handcart and the rest would take the car to the other end of the rail line. Starting at opposite ends, they would push towards the center and find the gun. Indy and Bernie caught up to the gun train early the next morning. It fired once and then started down the line. They raced after it.
  </p>
  <p key="77487a88-a353-479d-b465-c3f07d5b8002">
   Meanwhile, up the track, the others spotted the train coming and hid. Indy and Bernie tried to catch up to the train, but lost site of it when it disappeared behind a hill. Eventually they came into sight of the others, but the train did not pass them. It had seemingly disappeared! While the others tried to decide what to do next, Indy examined the toilet paper they stole, which was actually old documents being "recycled" due to the scarcity of paper. One of the documents was an order for forty miles of telegraph cable. They found the cable buried along side of the track and followed it. It leads to a dead end at the side of a cliff face.
  </p>
  <p key="2ba7c402-96c6-42d9-ac72-f7c5e26cd0c1">
   Further examination of the cliff face revealed that it was artificial, hiding the entrance to a cavern. They sneaked in and found the train. Big Mac immediately began supervision of the laying of the explosives. They had to hurry when some Germans began to approach the train to prepare for another mission. They quickly set the timers and got to cover. Unfortunately, nothing happened due to faulty wiring in the timers. They had to go back and reset them. Indy managed to jump the shovelman, knocking him unconscious. Indy was to replace him in the engine's cab and try to delay the train's departure. Despite his best efforts, the train began to pull out of the cavern with the rest of the group hanging onto the side.
  </p>
  <p key="71804c9f-af5b-483d-9f36-2e6c729512be">
   Big Mac and Zoltan went back and reset the timers. Indy threw the two engineers out of the cab so the others could get in. Soldiers further back on the train spotted the engineers' "departures" and tried to storm the engine. A fire fight ensued. They managed to separate the car with the soldiers from the front half of the train and made off with the gun. Indy suggested breaking through the German lines and taking the gun right back to the Allied lines.
  </p>
  <p key="66a519f9-d5d1-48b2-9f99-c3cf329f7e6a">
   Unfortunately, the German had telegraphed ahead. They managed to blow up a section of track and sent soldiers down to meet the train. The group stopped the train and managed to escape under the cover of steam. From a couple of hundred yards away, they witnessed the German troops arriving and disarming the explosives. Selous took out a sharpshooter's rifle, intending to shoot and detonate the dynamite. Indy was skeptical of him making the shot, however, Selous managed to do it. The train exploded and they headed back to Allied lines.

  <p key="bd7eb23b-21f0-4177-b284-fd5b58802416">
   Remy was glad to see Indy for he was anxious about rejoining their unit. Meanwhile, General
   Jan Christiaan Smuts
   was telling the others about the chance to capture General
   Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck
   , a German officer who had been a thorn in the Allies' side. Indy arrived and asked the General for a letter to his commanding officer explaining the circumstances of their tardiness. Selous convinced Indy to take an alternate route to
   Lake Victoria
   and that they would accompany him on the trip. They neglected to tell Indy that the new route would bring them close to where the reports saw von Lettow was. Since they would be passing through German territory, they disguised themselves as Boer settlers. Remy was not happy with the plan, especially since he was the one who had to wear the dress.
  </p>
  <p key="6a5378b4-4c7b-4181-9533-0899a2242bbd">
   On the first day out, they spotted and overtook a German courier. It was a woman by the name of
   Margaret Trappe
   . Selous knew her and her mother, who was one of the finest aviators in Africa. They took her prisoner and made camp that night. Indy took Margaret something to eat and tried to engage her in conversation. She told Indy that they'd never catch "him," but he didn't know what she was talking about. He asked Selous about it, but he feigned ignorance.
  </p>
  <p key="ed5e066f-832a-478a-94c5-f43da983e7b4">
   The next day they encountered a German patrol. They hid Bernie and Margaret in a secret compartment, however, their disguises didn't fool the Germans and they were taken prisoner. The wagon was searched, but Bernie and Margaret were not found. At the German camp, they were brought before von Lettow who recognized Selous. They exchanged pleasantries before von Lettow ordered them to be shot in the morning. Until then they were placed in a prison cell.
  </p>
  <p key="c02b65be-c6f4-49d2-93ec-a1a04444990f">
   Later that night, Bernie emerged from the hidden compartment and made his way to where the group was being held. Knocking out the guard, he freed them. They sabotaged the Germans' motor pool and reconnaissance plane so they couldn't be followed. They took one car for their own escape. Selous decided that they should try to kidnap von Lettow. They sneaked into his tent and took him easily. Meanwhile, Margaret had kicked her way out of the compartment and sounded an alarm. The group split up, leaving Indy and Remy with von Lettow. They took cover in a large basket which turned out to be a balloon gondola. As the German soldiers got closer, Indy launched the balloon. It floated to where the others were waiting with the car, but Indy couldn't get it to land. With the German soldiers closing in, the others had no choice but to make their escape. Indy got the balloon high enough to make their own escape.
  </p>
  <p key="a54ad6b6-b386-4bb0-bfe8-ad142d0446cd">
   The next day, von Lettow was becoming increasingly disgusted with Indy and Remy's ineptitude. He checked his compass and told them that they were heading for German territory and that he'd be glad to accept their surrender. They took the compass to check for themselves and found that they were actually heading towards the north which was Allied territory. Just then, some pursuing German troops came into range and began to open fire, puncturing the balloon. Despite Indy's frantic attempts at patching and Remy throwing over the ballast, they lost altitude and the balloon started skimming the ground. Indy had to fight off the few soldiers daring enough to try to board the balloon. It seemed hopeless when the balloon suddenly got swept into an updraft and floated out over a cliff, stranding their pursuers.
  </p>
  <p key="fd431aa8-ea03-43ce-8e6e-23e91ebe6286">
   As Indy finished patching the balloon, Margaret showed up in the repaired reconnaissance plane. Remy pulled out a heavy machine gun and managed to hit the plane, disabling it. As she came around for one last pass, Indy tried his hand at the machine gun. Unfortunately, it walked up on him and he winded up shooting the balloon to ribbons. The craft made a soft crash landing. They now had proceed on foot.
  </p>
  <p key="d0881e47-416f-4512-ba23-fa915ce67aa4">
   As they walked, von Lettow told how he had managed to run circles around the British for the last two years. He explained that a soldier had two imperatives: first was to follow orders and the second to stay alive. The next day, they encountered some tribesmen who looked threatening. They tried to run for it, but were followed. Indy gave von Lettow a gun as a gesture of trust. The tribesmen had the three surrounded, when Margaret appeared and buzzed them in the repaired reconnaissance plane. The tribesmen fled in terror. She landed and von Lettow tried to escape to the plane. Indy pulled a gun on him and Margaret pulled her gun on Indy. Remy was pointing his rifle at Margaret. They were trapped in a standoff and German soldiers could be seen coming in the distance.
  </p>
  <p key="017d74e8-1229-4f05-b2ee-5448c783053d">
   Following von Lettow's logic, Indy concluded that since he had no specific orders concerning von Lettow, his first responsibility was to stay alive, and let von Lettow go. In return, he gave Indy and Remy his compass and promised to call off the soldiers. Two days later, Indy and Remy were still making their way back to Allied territory when they found Selous and the rest of the group. Selous offered them a ride, and promised to get them to Lake Victoria.

   Indy and Remy finally made it to their Belgian unit near Lake Tanganyika. They were assigned to a company of native Askaris under the command of Major

   . During an attack, Indy saw an opening in the German defenses and rallied the men to charge, even though Major Boucher had ordered a retreat. During the charge, Indy went down, seemingly shot. After a moment he got back up and continued the charge. He single-handedly captured a machine gun nest and turned it on the Germans. A rout ensued. It turned out that the bullet that hit Indy was actually reflected off of the locket he received from Princess Sophie when he was a child. This earned the respect of the natives who now viewed Indy as one with powerful ju-ju, or magic. Boucher, however, was furious with Indy, but since his actions helped defeat the Germans in the area, he was given a promotion to captain.
  </p>
  <p key="c9a739c1-d600-4cc9-b5b0-374b0eee39a7">
   Major Boucher received orders that he as to lead his company on an expedition across the

   to get much-needed weapons and supplies from Cape Lopez, a trip of over two thousand miles. Indy was not thrilled at the prospect of the trip or of spending so much time with Boucher. However, their commanding officer,
   Colonel Mathieu
   , felt that they'd temper each one's personality.
  </p>
  <p key="44c5fade-17fa-4fb9-9900-b5c2c9442294">
   The company sat out, but the way was hard. They traveled across desert and jungle, occasionally losing men to accident or disease. Along the way, they came across an apparently deserted village. Upon investigation, they discovered that everyone had died from small pox with the exception of one small child. Boucher ordered the child left behind in order to avoid infecting the company. Indy disagreed but was overruled. Indy's sergeant,
   <a class="mw-redirect" href="Barthelemy.html" key="0846187e-83bd-4916-b172-f0f2bb7aec94" title="Barthelemy">

  </p>
  <p key="f55107d7-f776-478f-b79b-65946fd2ef55">
   The company pressed on. Some men started to fall sick from yellow fever. Boucher ordered these men left behind with limited rations and ordered to make it back to the base. Again Indy clashed with Boucher, but backed down. When the company stopped and sat up camp for the night, Indy discovered that Barthelemy has snucked the Ubangi child along. As much as he hated to, Indy told Boucher. Again, Boucher ordered the child to be left behind.
  </p>
  <p key="aaac6429-b4fa-4e17-9dc5-3fd41ecfaba0">
   The next morning when the company formed up, Barthelemy had the child with him. He refused to leave him behind even when ordered by Boucher. The rest of the company stood with him. Faced with such insubordination, Boucher began to rant and act irrational. Indy was forced to take command. They continued on with the child. By Christmas Eve, most of the men still alive had fallen sick. Indy began to wonder if they'd ever reach Cape Lopez.

  <p key="66a2eef6-e9bd-4490-a453-ae153cc791e4">
   1916
   turned to
   1917
   . Boucher fell ill, and Indy ordered a litter built over Boucher's objections. They finally reached Franceville, the beginning of the last leg of their journey. Here, they hired
   Sloat
   to take them to Cape Lopez, five hundred miles down river. Along the way, their boat was attacked by a group of deserters. Barthelemy was wounded but the boat was saved from running aground when the Ubangi child took the rudder and steered it to safety. Further down the river they passed a hospital, but Sloat said that it was run by a German.
  </p>
  <p key="278ff151-e087-4e01-857e-7dfb91cb41fb">
   Boucher ordered them to continue. More men died. Finally Cape Lopez came into view, but Boucher died before they could dock. His last order to Indy was to wire the boat with explosives for the return trip and blow it up if the Germans tried to capture it. The fort doctors examined the Ubangi boy and gave him a clean bill of health. Barthelemy wasn't so lucky, he died from his wounds. Indy gave the boy to the missionary nuns to raise and told them his name was Barthelemy.

   They started backup the river, but the diseases that plagued them on the trip down continued to decimate the company. Soon, as all the crew was on the verge of death, the boat was boarded by a
   black man speaking German.
   A fevered Indy panicked and tried to set off the explosives, but he was knocked unconscious. He reawakened briefly to find himself being carried off the boat, but lost consciousness again.

   Indy reawakened to a German doctor who gave him some medicine and told him he was not a prisoner. That night, Indy sneaked out to try to escape. The doctor came out to the boat and tried to convince Indy to come back to the hospital ward, but he refused. Later a woman came out to see Indy. She introduced herself as
   Mrs. Schweitzer

They discussed the reasons for the doctor's missionary work in Africa, and Albert and Indiana played a little ragtime duet on the doctor's piano.
  </p>
  <p key="6276b8e9-8e98-4553-b1cb-cb368869913d">
   The next day, messengers arrived from a Pahouin tribe upriver asking for "Oganga" - the term for Dr. Schweitzer as "The Giver and Taker of Life". Their chief's son was ill. Indy volunteered Sloat's boat for the house call, and took Schweitzer and Joseph up river to their
   village
   . Schweitzer was able to operate on the
   chief's son
   and save his life -- charging the boy to remember the lesson of his own pain, and work to ease the pain of others. Later, around a campfire, the
   Pahouin Chief
   asked about the war in Europe. Schweitzer had to put the idea of the devastating loss of life into terms that the chief would understand and told him that more than ten men had been killed. This caused concern with the chief. On the return trip to Lambaréné, Schweitzer explained the philosophy he had developed - "Reverence for Life" regarding keeping focus on promoting life and not ending life. Jones began to have a change of heart regarding his role in the war - rather than working to win it, he should be working to end it.
  </p>
  <p key="58b994e5-3d2f-4c24-82ea-ca7a5a5d1268">
   When Indy and Schweitzer arrived back at the hospital, they found French soldiers under
   Captain Rostand
   waiting to seize the doctor. They were under orders to apprehend all Germans in French territory for expulsion. Indy tried to reason with Rostand, but to no avail. Indy was also told that his mission to bring guns to

   to join the Belgium intelligence division. After all of the horrors he'd seen in the trenches, Indy wanted to do whatever he could to put a stop to the war. Indy and Remy attended courses on spy tactics and Indy came to realize that the Belgium intelligence unit was badly organized and ineffectual in comparison to the French and British intelligence services.
  </p>
  <p key="2f5bead6-c540-43b1-9f4f-2ee22ba9e55c">
   Indy decided that if he and Remy were going to make a difference in the war at all, they were going to need to be transferred to the French intelligence service. Indy forged papers ordering him and Remy to be transferred to the French intelligence service and Remy delivered them.

  <p key="2154b4ad-9a43-4b95-95a6-4c60d1c7068b">
   The two were called into the French secret service headquarters and were told that their service records in the Belgium army were outstanding as were the forged papers requesting their transfer. Just as the two began thinking that they were going to end up in jail, they were told that the intelligence service could use men like them. The two were asked if they could cook and Remy said that he could. They were also asked if they had any experience with airplanes. Indy said he did even though he hated flying for fear of ending up with housekeeping duty. Remy was assigned to be an intelligence contact at a cafe in Brussels and the main contact with the Belgian Underground. And Indy was ordered back to the Western Front to do photographic reconnaissance for the
   124th Squadron
   , a group of volunteer American pilots fighting for the French army, until a new assignment came in.

   and taking photos, not analyzing them. Indy met the members of the 124th Squadron, one of whom was
   Hobey Baker
   , who Indy used to run errands for. Indy learned that the longest any reconnaissance photographer had lasted with the squadron had been eight days.
  </p>
  <p key="b333c7c5-fc5c-4de9-b7e3-352e63895c71">
   The next day, Indy was about to take a photo of the squad when the French flying ace
   Charles Nungesser
   landed. Indy was told he's the best in the squad, but after looking at the number of bandages he had on, Indy thought he looked more like a walking accident. Later, the squad was informed that
   General Nivelle
   needed photos taken of a reported arms build up at the railroad yard in Ham which was about 40 kilometers behind the line.
  </p>
  <p key="76b6fb5a-c387-49cb-ae40-a17155bc8039">
   Indy got his first taste of the dangers involved in flying low over enemy territory while trying to take photos. He managed to get the photos taken, but a squadron of German fighters attacked them. The plane Indy was in was hit and Green thought the wheels might have been shot off. He ordered Indy to climb out on the wing to see if the wheels were still there and Indy barely managed to hang on as Green was forced to flip the plane around to avoid German fire. In the process, however, Indy got a close up look at the wheels which were still there. Their plane was shot once again and they were forced to make an emergency landing in German territory.
  </p>
  <p key="b5448550-ed93-4478-906b-2d997fdf12bd">
   Green was shot in the arm as they ran from the crashed plane and both men were captured by the Germans.
   Baron Manfred von Richthofen
   , the ace German fighter pilot who would later become known as the "Red Baron", landed and claimed the crashed plane as his trophy and Indy and Green as his prisoners since he shot them down. Green was taken to a hospital and Indy was invited to von Richthofen's castle to be his "guest" for lunch.
  </p>
  <p key="a337bc9e-1411-447f-83cd-4936e1fa31e1">
   Back at the 124th Squadron base, the other men reported in and Hobey immediately headed back to search for Indy and Green. At the Baron's castle, Indy was told by von Richthofen's brother how the Baron lived to hunt and how they were like knights adorned with colorful scarves and the fighter planes were their steeds. Indy asked why they don't just paint their planes red. Von Richthofen asked Indy if he knew Nungesser who shot down his brother. He told Indy that he felt obliged to avenge his brother and Indy watched as he wrote a challenge for Nungesser to aerial combat.
  </p>
  <p key="0bd04314-219d-4f82-adbd-2db486896a5a">
   Later, Indy was sent to a German prison and von Richthofen ordered his plane to be painted red. On the way to the prison, Indy managed to escape and commandeer a German car. Hobey spotted him from his plane and managed to pick him up. The two arrived back at the base just as a German plane flew by dropping von Richthofen's challenge to Nungesser. Nungesser was in Paris, so the rest of the squad went to bring the challenge to him. Nungesser accepted the challenge and asked Indy to accompany him to take photos of his victory. Indy reluctantly agreed and flew with Hobey as they and Nungesser headed off to the designated site the next day.
  </p>
  <p key="9b85add0-0542-4730-a465-dc7d027fd3a3">
   Nungesser managed to hit von Richthofen, but Indy and Hobey were not certain if the plane went down. A full German squadron suddenly attacked them and Nungesser was shot down. Indy and Hobey returned to the base and developed the film which confirmed that Nungesser shot down von Richthofen. Nungesser was brought back to the base having been rescued from No Man's Land where his plane went down. He told them that he thought von Richthofen managed to land.
Back in Germany, Anthony Fokker, the leading German designer of fighter planes, showed von Richthofen the new fighter he had designed, the Fokker DR-1 Triplane, which was much more powerful than the Baron's Albatross which Nungesser shot down. Back at the base, Nungesser said goodbye to Indy as he headed back to Paris, but promised to be back in time to take Indy back to Paris himself when Indy's assignment was up. Von Richthofen saw the picture Indy took of his plane going down in the newspaper and told his brother that next time he would shoot the cameraman down first.

   Indy managed to survive on many reconnaissance missions over the next week, but on the last day of his assignment the squad was called in by Lufbery and told about a possible new German airfield that intelligence had learned of. They believed it to be the home-base of the recent night bombings that had been made by the Germans. Indy was ordered to fly with Hobey and get pictures of the airfield to determine exactly where it was.
  </p>
  <p key="f8470f8a-3203-410c-87ad-1346444f72d2">
   The 124th Squadron flew over the enemy lines and Indy got the pictures taken, but von Richthofen and a squadron of German fighters attacked. Richthofen shot up Indy and Hobey's plane and they began to plummet towards the ground. At the last minute they managed to pull out of their fall and landed the plane back at the base. Indy prepared to leave and was told by Hobey and Raoul that Wilson had declared war on Germany and America was now in the war. Raoul told Indy that the 124th squadron would be turned over to the Americans. Indy told them that he just hoped he never had to fly again. Just then, Nungesser showed up to take Indy back to Paris.
  </p>
  <p key="0fe872b6-24aa-4140-bb24-cb8b6eaccf19">
   On the way, Nungesser told Indy that he'd been given a special assignment. Nungesser dropped Indy off at the French Intelligence Headquarters. Indy reported in and was told of his next assignment: to contact Fokker and persuade him to defect to the French. He was to tell Fokker that if he accepted, another agent would arrive and make arrangements to get him out of Germany. He was told to report to room 13B for debriefing. Indy went to 13B and was given his travel papers to Hannover and his new identity to travel under. Indy was then told to go to room 13C. He did so and was given a full compliment of spy-related items hidden in his clothing such as maps hidden in his suit, materials to make a camera hidden in his right shoe and a retractable knife hidden in his left shoe. He as also given a suitcase and a vial of invisible ink and told to go on to room 13A. In 13A, Indy was told that he should try to reach Fokker at a hotel in Hannover where he would be staying on his way to a German military base. Indy was given the letter for Fokker detailing the French government's offer and was told he would leave for Hannover that night.
  </p>
  <p key="f104341b-ff2f-4759-93f3-429b70002a71">
   Indy found that the pilot who was flying him to Hannover was Charles Nungesser. Indy was upset to find out that he wouldn't actually be landing in Hannover, but instead had to parachute down. Indy landed in the middle of town and managed to hide the parachute before he could be discovered. He checked in to the hotel that Fokker was staying at, but found out that he had arrived just as Fokker was leaving. Indy was unable to deliver the letter, so he followed Fokker onto a train heading to Ahlhorn.

   and thus the only way Indy was able to contact Fokker was by dressing as a steward and slipping a note into Fokker's pocket. They arrived at Ahlhorn and Indy posed as Fokker's valet in order to accompany Fokker and the German's heading to the military base. Meanwhile, Nungesser was waiting in Hannover for Indy and decided that if Indy didn't show by nightfall he would have to leave.

  <p key="62124a9a-de1e-4b69-98b5-f5209133aec5">
   Indy brought Fokker's bags to his room and at last got to speak with him. He gave Fokker the letter, but Werner and Von Kramer arrived for Fokker with aircraft designer
   Villehad Forssman
   and a compliment of German military officers before Indy could get a reply. Indy hid as Fokker was told by Forssman that he had designed a new aircraft fighter which would be arriving later in the day. Fokker headed out with them and Indy wrote a letter to French Intelligence which appeared to be a request for a hotel reservation, but in invisible ink contained a warning of the new secret weapon.
  </p>
  <p key="749aa61f-d171-4cea-8100-c93692589e31">
   Indy was able to meet with Fokker again later and Fokker told Indy that he was not interested because the money the French were offering was too little and the facilities in Germany were far better. Indy tried to ask him if he cared if his work was put to the use of good or evil. Fokker told Indy that science thrived in the times of war due to the money government's put towards weapons development and in the end humanity as a whole benefited from the advances in technology. He told Indy to leave, but on the way out Indy stole Fokker's cigar box.
  </p>
  <p key="1d61b7d3-76f8-4bfb-a9dc-95e41ad07bdb">
   Indy sneaked into the barracks and stole a German uniform. He turned the cigar box into a makeshift camera with the supplies he was given by French Intelligence. Baron von Richthofen arrived at the Ahlhorn base to see Forssman's invention. Indy bluffed his way into one of the cars headed towards the airfield to see the invention. Once there Indy witnessed the arrival of Forssman's monstrosity, a gigantic triplane with ten engines that could fly from Germany to New York in order to drop bombs. Fokker claimed that if he was allowed to work on it he could make it fly twice as far. Indy took pictures of it from the top of a hanger, but von Richthofen spotted him. German soldiers rushed Indy, but a shot from a soldier's gun ignited fuel stored in the hanger. Indy escaped in the confusion and the fire ignited the hydrogen stored in the hanger for the Zeppelins. The resulting explosion took out the entire airfield including the Forssman's new aircraft. Indy stole a motorcycle and made his way back to Hannover where he arrived just in time to catch Nungesser before he left and the two headed back to Paris.

   In May, Indy was run off the road while on his bike by a car driven by two young men as he rode to French intelligence service headquarters to learn of his next assignment. When he arrived, he learned he was there to meet the two young men who ran him off the road. They were a bit disappointed in him as Indy did not fit their idea of a spy. Indy learned that they were the Princes
   Xavier
   and
   Sixtus
   of Bourbon-Parma and he had been assigned to escort them to meet with their brother-in-law,
   Emperor
   Karl I
   , in
   Vienna
   . The Emperor wished to negotiate a separate peace with

  <p key="ac4de8b3-cbda-4aa4-b5ea-885af880a1a3">
   At the rail-station, the three were given forged papers and told that once they were in Austria to await contact from an operative named
   Schultz
   . On the train, Indy was upset with the brothers' carefree attitude. He took from Sixtus a letter written by their sister
   Empress Zita
   and burned it. If they had been discovered with the letter they would have definitely been shot as spies.
  </p>
  <p key="c86fafbe-10b6-4ab1-a5f3-f52d201b12f8">
   At the Austrian border, they separated to pass through the checkpoint. Indy and Xavier made it through, but Sixtus was taken by the secret service. Xavier started to panic, but Indy calmed him and got him on the train. Sixtus rejoined them as the train began to pull away from the checkpoint. Evidently, the secret service thought he was someone else. Indy thought they might have let him go in order to shadow the trio. Just then a large woman entered the compartment and sat down, curtailing any further conversation.
  </p>
  <p key="0ebaa752-0ed4-45b0-9195-a7dc12aae6cc">
   Later, a conductor entered to punch tickets, but took Xavier's and Sixtus's. Indy followed the conductor to another compartment and questioned him. It seemed that there was some mix up with their compartment assignments. Indy went to return to the compartment, but found it empty except for one man. The man made what Indy interpreted as a threatening move and Indy attacked him. All he was reaching for was his cigars. Indy apologized, realized he was in the wrong compartment and headed off to the right one.

   Outside of Vienna, the three got off the train and awaited contact from Schultz. The large woman approached them and identifies herself. She gave them new identity papers, that of Austrian soldiers on leave, and a car. She instructed them to drive to an address in Vienna and to introduce themselves as "friends of Frederick." They arrived at the address to find police carrying out bodies. An officer told them that they had just smashed a spy ring. As they began to drive away, a mysterious man got into the car and instructed them to drive. All this was watched by a menacing-looking

   There, in the basement, they finally met Emperor Karl.
   Count Czernin
   , the foreign minister was summoned. Xavier and Sixtus told them that France and Britain wanted peace. Czernin had some misgivings regarding the demands. He felt that the Kaiser would label their actions as treasonous. They had to balance the consequences of breaking their alliance with Germany with the war continuing. Karl also didn't want to be known as the last Emperor of Austria. The Count said he would draft an acceptance letter. The letter the Count wrote was vague. Despite his misgivings about it, Karl signed it.
  </p>
  <p key="79900bdd-5c4a-4b20-bde3-7d4ee57fac45">
   The next day as the trio prepared to leave, Karl slipped Indy another letter. Karl agreed to the demands and was suing for peace. Back in Vienna, they arrived at Mr. Max's apartment but found him dead. They were ambushed by the Prussian's men and escaped into the sewer after a chase across the rooftops and alleyways. They managed to get to the train, but were going to have a problem getting across the border with no new identity papers and still dressed as Austrian soldiers.

  <p key="bd31da66-3956-43c3-828f-da4f2ca503fa">
   At the last stop before the Austro-Swiss border, the train was searched by the Prussian's men. The three hid in a women's bathroom to avoid detection. Indy was able to trick two of the secret service men into a trap as the train continued. He dressed Sixtus and Xavier up in their clothes and instructed them to get through the checkpoint and return the letter to France. The brothers got through the checkpoint just as the secret service men revived and sounded an alarm. Indy was trying to sneak across the boarder on top of the train and managed to make it into Swiss territory where he immediately claimed to be an Austrian deserter seeking asylum. He smiled at the Prussian man as he was taken away to safety.

   One month later, Indy was buried deep in the Embassy's basement working at decoding and translation, though he'd much rather have been out in the field. He disagreed with his colleague Brossard's analysis that the Bolsheviks were planning to move soon. Indy felt that the Bolsheviks were still too small to be a serious threat.
One day as he was decoding communique, Indy came across a message which alarmed him. He went and met two friends of his,

   Later, the French Ambassador called a meeting of the Intelligence Staff. He felt that the provincial government was hanging on by its fingertips and that there could be an insurrection within the next two weeks. Given Lenin's threats to pull Russia out of the war if he came to power, both the ambassador and the provincial government would like any information that they could get.

   Indy spent the rest of the day collecting leaflets from around the city. That evening, Indy met with Sergei and some other of his friends. One of them,

Instead, they went for a walk throughout the city, ultimately winding up back at Indy's apartment, where Sergei and the others had set up a surprise birthday party for him. As they cut the cake, there was some good natured ribbing about the nature of capitalism and communism.

  <p key="c1aacced-a78e-40a0-819d-c94305c84d4e">
   Afterwards, they took Indy to hear Lenin speak. At the rally,
   Lenin
   denounced the war to an enthusiastic crowd. As people left the hall after Lenin finishes, Indy overheard two men arguing about the timing of the revolution. Making excuses, Indy left the group and sneaked into Bolshevik headquarters. He snooped through the printshop and found a flyer calling for the workers to rise up, but there were no dates on it. He was almost caught by two guards, but managed to escape back to the embassy. There, he conferred with Brossard who thought that the Bolsheviks would strike when the steelworkers were ready to join them. Indy disagreed.

   Indy went home around dawn to find Rosa waiting for him. She confessed her love for him, but while he was flattered, he told her that he didn't feel the same way about her. She mentioned that Sergei would be talking to some steelworkers later the same day. Indy confronted Sergei. He knew that there were more meetings planned for the next forty-eight hours than in the last few weeks. He wanted to know if the revolution was coming. Sergei understood Indy's position, but denied that the revolution was imminent. Lenin had just left the country to rest in
   Finland
   . Sergei asked him what kind of revolution starts when its leader is out of the country. Sergei also stated that the majority of the Russian people weren't ready to embrace the revolution yet.

   Later in the day, the French Ambassador called a meeting, asking for appraisals of the situation. Indy refuted Brossard's arguments by telling them that Lenin was out of the country. A report arrived to confirm what Indy had just said. The ambassador was impressed and pleased. A few hours later, Indy and Prostrate were summoned from the basement to the Ambassador's crisis room. An uprising began an hour earlier. As they arrived, reports were coming in from all over the city - bridges were blocked, Lenin was returning from Finland and Trotsky was addressing the crowds.
Indy was assigned to man the phones, taking reports from field agents. He heard a report about Sergei inciting the steelworkers and grew angry that he was lied to. Other reports started to come in stating that Lenin had returned to help Trotsky calm the crowds. They were telling people that it was not yet time for the revolution. Other reports stated that the Cossacks hadsided with the provincial government and were ready to fire on any marchers. The people were listening to the Bolshevik leaders and a bloodbath was inevitable. Indy went to Sergei to warn him against marching, but was unheeded. Disgusted, he headed home where he met Rosa. He told her all about what had happened and she decided to try to talk to Sergei herself. He followed her. Along the way, they saw Cossack snipers along the rooftops. They reached the square, shouting a warning just as the snipers opened fire. Sergei was one of the first to be shot and died in a crying Irena's arms. All total, four hundred people died that day. Lenin fled the country and the revolution didn't happen until later in October.

   As he wandered the city in search of employment, Indy saw a poster advertising the El Ballet Ruso and that an old acquaintance,

   . Picasso introduced Indy to
   Sergei Diaghilev
   , the head of the ballet who, after making Indy remove his pants so he could see Indy's legs, offered Indy a job. Unfortunately, it was as a dancer in the ballet, playing a eunuch in a production of Scherazade.
  </p>
  <p key="2e9abe9d-7b87-4c4c-a034-3384f66d5ccc">
   Indy returned to their headquarters, located under a barber shop, and told the other three of his attempts at finding a job. They told him that he should keep the position at the ballet. Schmidt had fallen in love with the chief ballerina. They were convinced that there was no better cover for him. The next day, Indy met the chief ballerina,
   Nadia
   . Schmidt also arrived to court Nadia, but winded up exchanging cross words with Picasso before she could separate the two.
  </p>
  <p key="c1a57728-a88c-4078-89e6-82bac1790a0d">
   That evening, Indy and Cunningham were at the harbor observing boat movements. Cunningham stressed to Indy the importance of keeping track of the movements of German submarines, even though it seemed to Indy that he was turned it into a hobby similar to train spotting. Cunningham also congratulated Indy on his work so far, but was disappointed that Schmidt wasn't in love with a duchess or other royalty. That would really cause a scandal. Indy suggested that they create the illusion that Schmidt was having an affair with a Contessa. In other words, they set him up.
  </p>
  <p key="67e719ab-5b86-4f1a-ada1-9541d5685fa6">
   The next day during practice, Indy sneaked into Nadia's dressing room to steal one of Schmidt's love letters. He was almost caught by Nadia's costumer, but she was nearly deaf and didn't hear him. Nadia did catch him in her dressing room, but he managed to sweet talk his way out of trouble and landed a date for lunch as well. He also managed to steal one of Schmidt's letters right out from under Nadia's nose.
  </p>
  <p key="8807ad3f-8dec-46b0-81e9-9ec8f87e5c2e">
   Back at headquarters, Marcello forged a copy of the letter, but addressed it to the Contessa of Toledo. The plan called for them to make the Count think that Schmidt was infatuated with the Contessa, starting the scandal they need. The next day Indy picked up Nadia for lunch. She spotted him sneaking the letter back to where he got it, but didn't say anything until they had eaten. Indy said he read the letter because he was jealous of the count. Nadia appeared to be touched and changed the subject.
  </p>
  <p key="5da4975d-84b2-431e-b913-04342149e1aa">
   Later, Marcello impersonated Schmidt and stoppeds the Contessa for directions. Appearing grateful, he kissed her hand, which did not go unnoticed by the Count's chauffeur. Later, the chauffeur went to pick up the Count, but was stopped by a diversion set by Charles and Cunningham. Indy sneaked into the car to plant the forged letter, but winded up getting trapped inside. He was able to escape without being discovered. The Count discovered the letter and was infuriated.
That evening before the ballet's performance, Nadia discovered that her letter was traced. She wrote a note to Schmidt warning him and gave it to the old costume lady to deliver. Indy went to see Nadia, but she brushed him off. He discovered that she knew about the plan and had sent a message to Schmidt. He couldn't get to the other three to tell them as he was rushed onto stage as the ballet began. Meanwhile, Marcello, Charles and Cunningham sat in one of the private balconies. They sent a note to Schmidt, allegedly from the Contessa, whose acknowledgment was noticed by an irate Count.
  </p>
  <p key="4926124e-483d-418c-9025-b4aab1068fd9">
   On stage, Nadia noticed that the old costume lady was heading in the wrong direction. She tried to signal her, but to no avail. On stage, Indy tried to signal the other three to intercept the old woman and the note. Meanwhile, the trio had sent Schmidt another note, whose response further infuriated the Count. Indy succeeded in signaling the trio in Morse code by flashing a spotlight off of a jewel on his costume's codpiece. Being the Ballet Ruso however, Indy's pelvic gyrations were interpreted as part of the show and he was given a standing ovation.
  </p>
  <p key="b9adc7c3-9535-4f9b-982d-3278ccc97bfb">
   The trio were unsuccessful at stopping the old woman, but she delivered the note to the wrong box anyway. After the ballet, an enraged Count challenged Schmidt to a duel. Nadia tried to warn Schmidt but was stopped by Indy who tied her up and put her in a closet. Indy then told the other three what happened and they were ecstatic. An hour or so later, Indy had changed and let Nadia out of the closet. She told him that Schmidt was an American double agent and that she was his contact. Indy took her to headquarters where they got confirmation of her story. By the time the verification arrived however, it was almost time for the duel. Marcello, Charles and Cunningham immediately hatched a number of ludicrous plans to stop the duel, but Nadia suggested telling the truth. In order to do that, they had to go to the theater to get the letter that Marcello forged. Upon searching Nadia's dressing room for it to no avail, they raced down to the basement and retrieved it before it is burned with the trash.

   In August, Indy met with his espionage counterparts and was told that due to his outstanding performance in the field he had been reassigned by French Intelligence to work for
   Colonel Clouseau
   . Indy headed to
   Amsterdam
   to meet his contact and find out the details of his mission. His contact, disguised as a blind man, told him he had to go to

   in the heart of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, set up residence in an apartment and wait for a phone call from a double agent which would come in three days. He was told that the phone call is of momentous importance in helping to end the war.
  </p>
  <p key="63d8fa8a-893a-493b-857c-529067e87513">
   Indy traveled to Prague disguised as a ladies underwear salesman named Amadeus Shooblegrueber. Upon arriving in Prague, Indy met Clouseau, who was disguised as a street merchant, and got the key to the apartment he was to receive the phone call in. Indy immediately fell asleep in the apartment and awoke the next morning to discover that the apartment's phone was removed by the authorities. Indy was told to go to the Ministry of Telephones in order to get a phone installed.
  </p>
  <p key="b5225822-36e2-40c2-b845-5dd8f52eb7cb">
   After getting sent back and forth between the different departments in the Ministry of Telephones, Indy was told that his phone needed to be reported as stolen and was given a form which needed four stamps from four different places in order to get a new phone put in the apartment. The form, after getting the first stamp on it, accidentally blew out an open window and Indy risked his life chasing after it.
  </p>
  <p key="88516d35-e8c4-4d51-a025-9ce9aaa4555d">
   Finally retrieving the form, Indy headed to the police department to get the first of the four stamps he needed. After arriving at the police station Indy was given a ridiculously long form which he had to fill out twice in two different languages. Indy was then brought into an interrogation room and began to worry that the police must have somehow found out that he was a spy. The police interrogated Indy and tried to get him to "confess," however, Indy had no idea what he was supposed to be confessing to. Indy swore he was just trying to report a missing telephone. Indy ended up in court, was found guilty and was locked in jail.
  </p>
  <p key="a807cc3f-815d-4041-8750-77ab1b2bca9c">
   The next morning, Indy told the guard that he'd been imprisoned due to an error and was given a form to fill out. After filling out the form, Indy was released along with his original form and the stamp he needed on it. Indy then went to the Ministry of Insurance to get the next stamp he needed only to find out that he first needed to fill out form "27A." Indy went to four different offices trying to find it only to learn from
   Franz Kafka
   that form 27A was superseded by form 27B. Indy exploded at Kafka telling him all of the trouble he'd been through and demanded to get his phone only to find out that he was in the wrong office. Kafka decided to help Indy track down the form.
  </p>
  <p key="36587487-3cf7-45aa-9a3b-41cedd126b6c">
   They located the filing cabinet that had the form in it, but learned that the cabinet was locked and the key had been lost. Indy and Kafka tried bringing the heavy cabinet to the basement so the janitor could unlock it and ended up riding the cabinet down the winding stair case, destroying half of the building in the process. The cabinet smashed, Indy got form 27B and his original form got the third stamp.
  </p>
  <p key="32837a48-e896-4fcd-81e1-ffef31bb6017">
   Indy returned to the Ministry of Telephones, got the final stamp and was told that the phone would be installed the following morning. The phone was installed, however, the workers informed him that someone from the connections department would be along in a few weeks to connect it. Indy finally managed to get the phone hooked up by dangling outside of his third story window with seconds to spare only to receive the call from the doubleagent who told him that he had to go to Berlin and arrange to have a phone installed.

   . Indy's old friend,
   T.E. Lawrence
   pointed out that that would mean crossing the desert and there was not a drop of water between them and Beersheba. Colonel
   Richard Meinertzhagen
   said that they could make it if the men traveled light and made a lightning dash across the desert. The whole operation, however, would depend on the wells in Beersheba being full of water. They also would need to begin a major espionage campaign to make the Turks believe that they intended to continue their main attack on Gaza and put a trusted agent in Beersheba who spoke both Arabic and Turkish to keep a watch over the wells. Lawrence said he knew the man they wanted. Indy's commander told him he'd been reassigned to the British and was to report to Meinertzhagen. Indy told his commander that Meinertzhagen was the lunatic who almost got him killed in Africa when he was assigned to the 25th Royal Fusiliers to blow up a German train.

The three managed to escape, however, the bag they were carrying with their orders was dropped and taken by the Turks. When the three returned to the base camp, Indy learned that Meinertzhagen faked getting shot with the use of calf's blood and meant to have the Turks steal the bag which contained fake plans of an attack on Gaza. T.E. Lawrence arrived and Indy learned that he was the one who got Indy involved in this operation.
  </p>
  <p key="33730b7f-b4c3-4fc1-a8f6-d7a55976020c">
   Lawrence and Meinertzhagen explained to Indy how the 50,000 British troops that would march across the desert over a period of two days to attack Beersheba would only be carrying one canteen of water each and thus if they couldn't take Beersheba the same day they arrived with the wells intact and full of water they would be stranded in the middle of the desert and die. Indy's mission was to do everything he could to protect the wells. Indy and Ned talked over dinner and Indy told him how he and his father didn't talk much anymore. Jack arrived and introduced Indy to the rest of his troop.

   The next day Jack told the rest of his troop that they'd just gotten orders to move out, but they hadn't yet been told where they were headed.

   Indy sent a courier pigeon back to the base with a note about the wells. Kazim pointed out Bey and Captain
   Schiller

After leaving the cantina, Bey removed the note from Maya hidden in the veil and learned that she still didn't know where the British planned on attacking. Kazim told Indy that tomorrow they would have to cut the wires to the wells individually.

  <p key="ead336c6-ff2f-4361-a27c-869a25cbdebb">
   Indy met with Maya and asked her to dance for Colonel Bey again tomorrow at exactly 1300 hours. Maya asked if this meant that the attack would be on Beersheba, but Indy didn't confirm it. Indy and Maya spent the night together which caused Indy to arrive late for his meeting with Kazim. Kazim was caught digging up a wire at one of the wells as the British arrived at Beersheba. Bey tried contacting General von Christenstein to send troops from Gaza, but Schiller believed the British troops were a diversion for the real attack on Gaza and stopped him from making the call.
  </p>
  <p key="65f2b654-4c18-4119-aabe-2c1e1bc02ee2">
   Australian Commander Harry George Chauver ordered the British troops to advance and the Australian Light Horse Brigade to be kept in reserve. The attack began and Indy wrote a message to the British informing them that the plan had failed and Kazim had been arrested. He told Maya that the real attack was at Beersheba and she shot the pigeon carrying the message so the British wouldn't have any warning that reinforcements would be arriving from Gaza. She brought Indy to Bey and informed them about the British attack. Schiller had Kazim brought in and told Bey that he was beaten into admitting that the attack on Beersheba was a diversion and that they knew Maya was a double agent who they used to feed the false information to. Indy tried to stop Kazim from telling them that the real attack was on Gaza, but was unsuccessful. Indy broke free and stabbed Kazim in the chest with his knife.

  <p key="26460595-0fa5-4352-b8ec-525a1b395a2a">
   Indy was locked up and Kazim's body was removed. Schiller told Bey that there would be no reinforcements. Chauver ordered the Australian Light Horse Brigade to charge Beersheba instead of the British Cavalry in order to surprise the Turks. Kazim, far from dead, managed to slip away and managed to free Indy. They began cutting the wires to the explosives as the Australians advanced fast enough to ride in under the Turkish guns. Bey examined the knife Indy used to "kill" Kazim and found out that it was a trick knife. Indy and Kazim managed to cut the wires around all of the wells except for one. Bey ordered the wells to be blown up and the final well that Indy and Kazim were working on explodes. Indy told Kazim that they needed to stop them from rewiring the other six wells.

   Dex was shot dead as the Australians kept advancing. The Australians reached the garrison and began fighting the Turks. Indy and Kazim went to the tower where the main switch board controlling the explosives was. Bey fled the garrison as Schiller held off Indy and Kazim with a machine gun. Jack arrived on his horse and knocked the gun from Schiller's hands. Schiller ran into the tower and ordered the explosives to be blown. Indy arrived just in time to shoot the Turk before he pulled the switch. Schiller jumped Indy and the two fought. Indy managed to shoot Schiller seconds before he could blow the explosives. The Light Horse Brigade managed to take the garrison. Indy told Jack that it looked like they would be able to be in Jerusalem by Christmas to which Jack replied that he couldn't think of a better place he'd rather be at that time. The troops were finally able to relax and take a well deserved drink.

   A few days later, Indy was back across the German lines to meet his group of potential deserters. When he got to the meeting place, he found it empty. One of them arrived and said that the others were held up in the reserve lines and wouldn't be back until the next day. They'd cross over to the Italian side then.

   Back on the Italian side, Indy changed and went to see Giulietta, armed with a dozen roses and three bars of soap as a present. The other man had bought a couple of bouquets of flowers as well as a box of chocolates. Indy suggested that they went for a walk, but they wound up being chaperoned by her grandmother. Indy wanted to be alone with Giulietta, so he ran, dragging her along. They lost her grandmother in the bustle of the village square.

   Up on a hillside outside of town, Indy impressed her with the danger that he faced. They kissed, but unfortunately her grandmother finally catched up with them. The next day across the German lines, Indy was told that the Germans were planning an offensive in seventy-two hours. He then lead the defectors across no man's land. The Germans opened fire on their own, but the Italians fired back and the defectors made it across.

   Later, he tried to borrow a flute from a musician. Unfortunately, modern flutes were different from the ancient ones Indy knew how to play. He had to settle for a soprano sax. Ernie told him that he couldn't fail. The evening of Giulietta's birthday, Indy showed up armed with flowers, gifts and the sax. Her father was upset and rushed into the kitchen to confront her mother. He had invited the other suitor for dinner. When Giulietta heard the news she burst into tears. While the family fought in the kitchen, the doorbell rang. Indy answered it and found Ernie. It slowly dawned on them both that he was the other suitor. Before they could come to blows, the family arrived to announce that dinner was ready.

   During dinner, Indy and Ernie tried to out do each other, both of them heaping compliments on the food. After the meal, Ernie excused himself. Before Indy could say a word though, the sounds of the cello drifted into the room. Giulietta went into the living room and began to accompany Ernie on the piano. Indy grabbed his sax and the three broke into a spirited version of The William Tell Overture. As Indy and Ernie left, they got into an argument on the front lawn, vowing war.

   A few nights later, Ernie showed up to serenade Giulietta on the concertina. Indy arrived a few moments later with a small band of troubadours. Things began to escalate between the two. Ernie intercepted a shipment of flowers from Indy. Indy put itching powder in Ernie's shorts. Eventually, the two decided that they were getting no place with their fighting. They went to see Giulietta to have her choose between them. When they got there, they found her being fitted for a wedding dress. She was marrying an old friend -

Kemal was not happy with it, stating that Germany's aims were different from Turkey's. He didn't care what the Germans wanted, he just wanted to maintain the integrity of Turkey. Indy asked him if he would be interested in a separate peace with France. Kemal got a little suspicious and asked Indy if he had the authority to make such an offer. Indy hinted that he did. Aware that his staff could overhear their conversation in the next room, Kemal told him that he was in no position to consider such an offer but secretly made plans to meet with Indy again.

Indy rushed to the dying man's side but the documents that he was carrying in a briefcase were stolen amid the commotion. Indy called a meeting of the entire station and informed them that the documents contained the French terms for a separate peace. The Turkish Army had become more disillusioned with the Sultan and would be willing to follow Kemal. But if people loyal to the Sultan got ahold of the documents, Kemal could be considered a traitor.

Aware the Germans knew of Monty's "special consignment", a small group of four, including Indy and Stefan, went to Vescari's apartment, but found him drowned in the bathtub. Indy heard a noise in the main room and was attacked by a man with a knife, who cut him in the arm. They chased the man to the city rooftops. When Indy and Stefan finally cornered the man, who was carrying the documents, he told them that Vescari was tipped off by an insider from Indy's group. He then tried to flee again, but Stefan hit him and he fell to the street below, dead.

   Indy called another meeting at the station where he reviewed the documents. They were not what he expected. If they had fallen into the wrong hands, Kemal would have definitely been branded a traitor. Indy didn't trust anyone in the group and said he was having background checks run on everyone. He then hid the letter. Going to bed that night, Indy developed a fever from his knife wound and while he slept, his apartment was broken into and searched. Not finding what he was looking for, the intruder left.
The next morning, Molly visited Indy. She ordered him to bed and dressed the wound properly. She came back in the evening and made him dinner. He told her he was stabbed while gathering research for an article on the black market. They also discussed their wedding. She decided that she wanted to spend the night. The next morning, he walked her back to the orphanage. It was raining and he gave her his overcoat. Along the way, they saw a fortune teller and she asked if their love would last forever. The fortune teller said yes, but after they left, she saw something else in the runes that distressed her.

   Later, Indy was walking to the office, when he felt that he was being followed. He turned, and a man gave him a slip of paper which told him to be at a certain place at six o'clock. It was the rendezvous for his meeting with Kemal. He retrieved the documents from their hiding spot and told Stefan where he was going. Stefan was against his going, but Indy was insistent. He told Stefan that if anything happened, he'd be in charge as Stefan was the only one Indy trusted.
At the rendezvous spot, Indy was met by two Turkish soldiers who took him to see Kemal. Indy gave him the document. Kemal read it and was furious. It was not what he wanted or expected. Indy suggested negotiating with the French, but Kemal refused. He would achieve his dream of a free Turkey on his own terms. Indy left.

   On his way home, Indy was stopped by one of his fellow spies, Sadallah. He told him that he had just received word from headquarters as to who the double agent could have been. Before he could tell Indy, however, he was shot by a man in an alleyway. The police began to arrive and Indy had no choice but to get away. He called a meeting with the rest of the station. He had decided to shut down operations for a while and everyone was to lay low. Molly came to him at the news agency, very upset. Her employer had received a letter calling Indy a spy for the French and wanted to know if it was true. Jones admitted the truth and claimed that he had to lie in order to protect her, insisting that his love for her was real. Hurt and betrayed, Molly left telling him that she never wanted to see him again.

   Later, at the orphanage, Molly spent some time thinking. She then put on Indy's overcoat and left. Meanwhile, Indy was still at the office, when gunshots ripped through the door. They missed him and he ran into the street, headed towards his apartment. He knew he was being followed. At the apartment, he burned the documents and built a dummy for the pursuer to shoot at. As he hid by the door, he heard the other man slowly start to enter and take aim at the dummy. Just then, the door downstairs opened and a figure wearing an overcoat walked in. Thinking it was Indy, the other man turned and shot, hitting Molly, who had come to see Indy. Indy charged out onto the landing and saw that it was Stefan who was trying to kill him. Indy shot him dead. He ran to Molly's side, but she was dying. She told him that she still loved him and still wanted to get married. She then died in his arms.

   A tribe from a neighboring island arrived on boat and a ceremonial battle was played out. During the battle, Indy managed to free himself, but he ran to the aid of Biok when he saw him get hit by a spear. The boy died and was carried back to the village by both of the tribes.

   The next day, Indy and Remy departed with the neighboring tribes and were taken back to their village where they met anthropologist
   Bronislaw Malinowski
   . He told them that the tribes did not want to fight, but did so because the "ghosts" wanted them to battle. Indy and Remy learned that a freighter came by occasionally and that they would be able to get back to

   Back at Malinowski's house, Indy and Remy managed to pry open the box. Instead of finding a diamond inside, however, they found a stone and Remy exploded in rage. Over dinner, Malinowski told them how he was documenting the culture of this tribe so that it wouldn't be lost when it eventually changed. Remy returned to his room and Indy told Malinowski how they had been treasure hunting. Indy said how he'd like to eventually return to the states and attend the University of Chicago to study archaeology.
  </p>
  <p key="2b7b5b1e-d2b8-4c0c-b0ec-9e1b70db06dc">
   The next morning Indy showed Malinowski the stone which had an inscription on it. Together they worked on translating it and discovered what may be a clue as to the diamonds whereabouts. Indy began to see how the treasure hunt had begun to become an obsession to Remy and began to wonder if he wanted to continue on in search of the diamond.
Later, Malinowski asked Indy what he would do once he had found the diamond. Indy replied that he'd return to the states and attend college. Malinowski pointed out that was exactly what he wanted to do before he began his treasure hunt and that it was foolish to waste his time searching for something he did not really need while he could be pursuing his real dream.
  </p>
  <p key="84fb8b5a-8da2-4c7c-b7b3-1a6209973b72">
   Indy later told Remy that he was not going to continue on the search, but instead he was returning to the states. Remy tried to talk him out of it and, when he realized that Indy would not change his mind, he told him that he would continue on alone. Indy and Remy left on the freighter and eventually went their separate ways. Indy didn't know it then, but years later he would once again find himself searching for the diamond.

Toynbee said that Wilson was obsessed with his League of Nations idea and would concede anything to get it. The world was changing and history was now moving in a spiral, he said. If they tried to push Germany down now, it would only rise again. He gave Indy some words of advice which he then later wrote in his journal - "Those who forget the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them."

   A few days later, Indy was brought to Wilson's study to transcribe a conversation between Wilson, Lloyd-George and Clemenceau. They were arguing over Arabia. Wilson was not happy with Lloyd-George's and Clemenceau's secret agreement. He proposed a commission to find out the will of the people as to who should rule them. The other two reluctantly agreed.

Indy went to follow Ned, but was stopped by their Vietnamese waiter, who overheard the whole argument. The waiter wished to talk to Indy, but Indy brushed him off in his haste to catch Ned.

  <p key="3d1a28bb-2afa-4854-a74c-6e44f72f03d8">
   Indy did catch up to Ned down the street. Ned apologized, saying that he'd become cynical. He wondered how Indy got through the whole war without losing his ideals. A few days later, King Faisal of Arabia addressed the conference. Ned translated for him. Faisal asked for justice and the fulfillment of England's promise of freedom. He asked that his country not be divided up like war booty for the colonial powers. As Indy was walking home that evening, he was stopped by the Vietnamese waiter, who introduced himself as Nguyen. He said that he was part of a delegation of patriots who wished address the conference, but no one would see them. They were beginning to get desperate. Indy was not sure that he could help, but he would see what he can do. Indy presented the idea to his boss, who was against it. He told Indy to forget what Wilson said about helping all the people of the world. Presidents may come and go, but diplomats would always stay. Indy did manage to persuade him to get the Vietnamese a hearing.

   Later, the Vietnamese delegation presented their request to some of the diplomats. All they asked for were certain freedoms and a voice in the French Parliament. They were told it would be considered. Outside of the hall, Indy apologized, saying that he wished it could have gone better. Nguyen was happy that they at least got their chance to be heard.

   At dinner, Indy was disgusted that no one seemed to care. Toynbee told him that no one was interested in the common people's interests except for Wilson. The real decisions were being made in private, with the colonial powers carving up the world for themselves. Indy wondered why they fought the war in the first place. Ned arrived and let them know that the German delegation had finally arrived. They were delayed by the French who forced them to take a train ride through some of the worst areas of the battlefield. At the station, the train was met by an angry mob which the police could barely keep back. The German delegation was refused cab service and had to walk to their hotel.
Indy and Ned talked about why they thought the war was fought. Ned originally thought it was to preserve democracy, but now was not sure that it was accomplished. As Indy was walking home, he saw the German delegation being followed by an angry mob of people. He followed them to the hotel, where a porter began throwing out their luggage to the crowd. Indy was close to the front and managed to hand one of the bags back to a young German diplomat.

   The next day, the Germans came before the conference. Clemenceau said that there would be no negotiating of terms and that the Germans had fifteen days to sign the treaty. Later at the opera, Toynbee joined Indy, Ned and Gertrude. He said that Wilson had finally conceded almost all of his fourteen points. He also said that the terms of German reparation was even harsher than anyone thought that they would be. This plan would bankrupt Germany and perhaps drag the rest of Europe down with it. He predicted that the war would be fought all over again, in ten to twenty years. He also told them that Germany must assume all responsibility for the war.
  </p>
  <p key="674bb611-074a-4d97-8722-320cc1d3a699">
   At the conference, the German delegation said that they laid down their arms in accordance with Wilson's fourteen points, but now found that they were not in the treaty. They also refused to bear the guilt of the war. Clemenceau rebuked that the treaty must be accepted. Reluctantly, the head of the German delegation agreed.
Later, at a reception, the young German diplomat walked in. Everyone stopped and stared at him. Indy went over to him and helped him get a cup of coffee. The German recognized him from the hotel. They talked and found out that they both fought at Verdun. The German said that there would be no future for anyone if the rulers at the conference had their way.
  </p>
  <p key="47af4f8e-67b2-42fc-9f40-5ffb07483495">
   After the formal signing ceremonies, there was a large celebration. Indy said that he was glad that it was finally over. Toynbee disagreed, feeling that it is just beginning. As Indy was helping with the packing up of the American delegation's office, he came across the file with the Vietnamese delegation's request. It was stamped with the words "No Action." Indy was then summoned with his boss to President Wilson's office. There, they witnessed another conference between Wilson, Lloyd-George and Clemenceau. Wilson was upset that a commission was not being sent to Arabia. Lloyd-George said that the situation in the Middle East was much too volatile to make a decision now. Instead, he and Clemenceau proposed "Zones of Influence" for England and France. They promised Wilson to find something for King Faisal. Wilson conceded to them. After they left, Wilson was full of doubt. He got his League of Nations, but at what cost?

   The next evening at work, Indy apologized to Sidney for the commotion, but wound up gushing how much he loved jazz. Sidney asked Indy if he'd ever played an instrument and he admitted that he played soprano sax a little bit during the war. Sidney had a soprano sax which he gave to Indy to practice. After work, Indy got to tag along with the band as they performed at a speakeasy, The Four Deuces.

   A few nights later, Indy, Sidney, Goldie and C.J. spoke about change. As weeks went on, Indy continued to practice, getting better as he went. One night, Sidney overheard him at work and was impressed with his progress. After work, the band headed over to the Golden Palace to hear Goldie sing. While Sidney was jamming with the band, he invited Indy up on stage and they proceeded to storm through a swinging version of "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star”.

   The next day, as the restaurant was getting ready to open, Colosimo was shot to death in the doorway. No one saw anything, although one waiter had to chase out a customer only a few minutes before the shooting. Indy noticed that Colosimo's rings were gone.

   Their first move was to go to the funeral procession to see who turns up. As the casket was solemnly paraded through the streets, they ran into "Big Al" Brown, a bartender at The Four Deuces who had a nasty scar on his face. Among the dignitaries in the procession were Mayor Bill Thompson, some judges and a couple of congressmen. Indy had to leave the funeral for work where they were holding a reception afterwards. Ernie had a couple of leads he wanted to check out. Eliot had a friend in the morgue and went to see what he could learn.

  <p key="9996ef71-8678-474a-8dcb-534921ebd7e9">
   Meeting with the coroner, Eliot learned that Colosimo was shot in the back of the head, possibly as he was looking out the front door's peephole. Ernie hanged out at the police station with some reporters, but learned nothing. They met at a soda fountain for lunch and traded information. Unfortunately, all they had are half formed theories with no evidence to back them up. They figured that Colosimo was waiting for someone and the killer knew it. If they could figure out who the killer was waiting for, they might be able to crack the case. Indy promised to talk to the waiter who chased the customer away. Ernie continued his digging in the Tribune's morgue. He also writes The New York Times for information.

   Sidney told Indy that Torrio would be taking over the restaurant and other business interests. He also said that Colosimo was waiting for a shipment of bootleg liquor. Later, Indy, Ernie and Eliot met. They decided to go to the restaurant and find out who sold Colosimo the liquor. Indy sneaked in and found the bootleg was packed in boxes marked "Cristo Lemonade Company." They traced this to a warehouse along the Lake Michigan waterfront. They went to the warehouse and broke into office. Unfortunately, they were discovered before they could find anything. The boys made a mad dash out and almost escaped, but were cornered when their car ran out of gas.

Ernie's information had arrived from The Times. It included the fact that Al Brown was really a small time gangster named

   The three took their findings to Garrity who destroyed the evidence and threw them out. He warned them to keep quiet about the whole affair. Garrity was obviously on the take. Ernie decided to go to Paris to write, while Indy quit his job. Later at The Four Deuces, Indy was still brooding about how things worked out. Sidney decided that Indy was now ready to play the blues.

   In June, Indy was leaving Chicago for a summer job that Sidney Bechet was arranging for him in New York City. On the train, he sat next to a beautiful young woman who didn't seem to like or trust him very much. However, after a misunderstanding over an apple that Indy dropped, they started to get along. She introduced herself as
   Peggy Peabody

The next morning Indy went to the theater and landed a job as the assistant to the stage manager, Mac. The theater was deep in rehearsals for its show Scandals of 1920 which its star and director, George White, hoped would blow away Ziegfeld's Follies. To that end, he had hired away Ziegfeld's star

During a break, Indy told George about Kate. Gershwin invited Indy and Kate to a party on Fifth Avenue. Back at Kate's she declined the invitation as she was going to a poetry reading. She told Indy to go ahead without her.

   George and Indy arrived at the party and Indy was swept away by the splendor of the penthouse and the beauty of
   Gloria Schuyler
   , daughter of the host. He followed her out to the balcony as the band began to play a tango. She and Indy danced and she was swept off her feet. She finally took him home in a limousine at dawn. They made plans to see each other that night. Indy rushed into Kate's with only an hour before he had to be at work. Kate was just getting up and they made plans to have lunch at the Hotel Algonquin at one o'clock.

   That morning at work, White was driving the chorus girls hard. Anne Pennington arrived to rehearse her number which Gershwin wrote. He complained that she was taking it too fast, but she didn't like the song anyway. White told him to write her another song. Later Gershwin asked Indy about how things went with Gloria and ribbed him about having two girls. Gloria then arrived to take him out to lunch. Afterwards, he got her to drop him off at the Algonquin under the pretext of having to run an errand for White. He also made plans to meet her for a late dinner at ten o'clock.
Inside the hotel, Kate introduced Indy to some of her friends that they'd be joining for lunch. Among them were author

   Most of the rest are theater critics who had already taken a dim view of White's production. Indy didn't think it was fair that they had written their reviews already. That afternoon at the theater, auditions were being held for new chorus girls. One of them was Peggy, who tells Indy that she didn't make it. Indy talked to George who gets her hired. Happy, she told Indy that she was buying him dinner tonight after work at six.

  <p key="360b425e-9b5a-4f9a-9c1f-452689d8d44d">
   Indy then got a phone call from Kate who was looking forward to having dinner with him around eight. While he was on the phone, a box of candy arrives from Gloria with a note reminding him of their date for ten o'clock. George could only marvel at Indy's predicament, but offered no help. As Indy tried to leave work, Mac, who had been drinking, gave Indy more work to do. He wound up being late to meet Peggy. She treated him to chili dogs, which he quickly ate, saying he had to get back to the theater. He then raced to Kate's where she fed him a big pasta dinner. Then making the same excuses about work, he headed out to Gloria's. When he got there, she noticed that he was looking a bit run down and lectured him on the importance of eating three meals a day.

   The next day at work, things were not going well. The new girls were slow to learn the dance numbers and the show opened in just ten days. White still hadn't found a girl to sing the song Anne rejected. Indy talked to George about having Peggy audition for it. Meanwhile, Schwartz had bad news for White. The backers had pulled out of the show and they needed twenty thousand dollars or the show would fold before it opened. That evening Indy told what happened to Peggy, Kate and Gloria. Gloria placed a call to her father.

  <p key="d4107615-5b73-4e6d-bba2-74ee62d1b0b0">
   The next day, Peggy was set to audition for the song when she was interrupted for an announcement. They had a new backer for the show, Gloria's father J.J. Schuyler. He had arrived to watch rehearsals with Gloria. He was impressed with Peggy's audition, so White gave her the number. Backstage, Indy was given a kiss by an excited Peggy, when Schuyler and Gloria showed up on a backstage tour with White. George saw Indy's predicament and pulled Peggy away before Gloria caught up to him.

   That night at Kate's, some friends were over for a poetry reading. She read them a poem about love that she wrote for a flattered Indy. He then left for dinner at Gloria's, where she gave him a watch. After dinner, he went to see Sidney with George and Peggy. While there, she gave him a monogrammed handkerchief. After practice the next day, Indy and George talked about his problem. Indy just couldn't decide what to do.
  </p>
  <p key="862f9714-f14d-43bd-ae49-caeabb56079f">
   A few days later, Indy joined Kate and her friends for lunch. They told him that Ziegfeld had threatened to pull his ads from their papers if they gave White's show good reviews. The critics promised not to let Ziegfeld blackmail them. During the meal, Indy spilled water on Kate. He pulled out Peggy's handkerchief to mop it up and she absently placed it in her purse.

  <p key="48c4ac24-ffa2-4fc0-a9a0-c757869419e0">
   With less than a week to go before the show, things had reached a hectic pace at the theater. The show was running overtime, so Peggy's number was cut. Indy gave her Gloria's watch pin to help her get to practice on time. When he went to Kate's after work, Gloria called, insisting that he come right over. Making an excuse to Kate, he rushed right off. At the penthouse, Indy read her lines from Kate's poem. She loved it and promised to have it engraved on his cigarette case.

  <p key="e5c9771c-405c-4062-a2d5-4fb8a97e7e4a">
   A day before the show, Indy received a dozen roses from Gloria which he passed onto Peggy. White was driving everyone unmercifully. Indy was having trouble getting the stage's turntable to run smoothly and it was vital to the show's first act finale. George and Indy relaxed after practice talking about the fate of the show. Indy remembered that it was his twenty-first birthday.
  </p>
  <p key="0aa90cf9-f128-4f5a-8c01-da26f0499a03">
   On opening night the backstage area was chaos. Kate arrived and told Indy that she had to review the show as the paper's regular critic was sick. Gloria and Mr. Schuyler showed up to wish Indy luck with only a few minutes until the curtain went up, the first emergency popped up. Mac was passed out drunk, courtesy of a bottle of booze sent by Ziegfeld. Indy would have to run the show. The next emergency cropped up moments later. Someone had stolen the costumes for the first number. Indy quickly improvised giant fans out of some costume feathers. The opening number went on, shocking some of the audience and impressing the critics.
  </p>
  <p key="0dc36a03-9f73-4682-950b-1346e840043f">
   The next number feathered Anne, but her dressing room door was jammed shut. Indy quickly battered it down and carried her bodily to the stage. Meanwhile, Bonzo, the monkey in an animal act that was part of the show, was running amuck in the rafters. As Indy tried to catch him, he inadvertently sent pillars crashing down onto the stage. The rest of the first act went well until the finale. The stage's turntable was broken beyond repair. George got an idea. He had Peggy sing the song he wrote exactly at the slow pace they practiced it at. What White had tried to make a jazzy ragtime number, Peggy sang as a slow love ballad and brought the house down.
  </p>
  <p key="4180c5d3-c7db-47dd-a0c9-f928aa06c529">
   After the show, Peggy, Gloria and Kate were all at the cast party, but George helped Indy put by keeping them distracted. The early editions of the papers arrived and the reviews were fantastic, with special notice of Peggy's singing. Despite George and Indy's jockeying, Kate, Gloria and Peggy ended up in the powder room at the same time. There, Kate noticed a few lines of her poem inscribed on Gloria's cigarette case. Gloria noticed her watch pin pined to Peggy. Peggy noticed her handkerchief in Kate's hand. Back at the party, a birthday cake was wheeled out for Indy. As he blew out the candles, the three women entered. Indy tried to explain, but they simply pushed his face into the cake.

Von Stroheim said that he alone decided the fate of his picture not an "errand boy."

   Indy was introduced to

At breakfast with Claire and Irving, Indy tried to decide what to cut. Irving introduced Indy to director
   John Ford
   . Ford told Indy to forget the script and view the film that had already been shot in order to decide what to cut. After watching the prints, Indy and Claire went to the beach to look at the night sky. Claire told him how currently the director was the "king" of the movie, while Bernstein wanted to shift that power to the producer. In the course of their conversation, a romance began to bud, but Claire told Indy that she had a boyfriend. In the middle of kissing Claire came up with a way to end the movie.

   The next day, Claire found out that she was fired from Foolish Wives. To further complicate matters, Indy found out that Stroheim had taken all of the prints for the movie to his house. Indy went there to get them back and, over watching von Stroheim drink ox blood, von Stroheim told him that he did not take the film. Irving later told Indy that they had the negative and could strike another print from it. They decided that in order to end the movie, they needed to film a scene where von Stroheim's character died.

   The following day, von Stroheim exploded in a rage when he found out that Massimo had not showed. He began thinking up new scenes in order to avoid filming his death scene and rehired Claire to write the scenes for him. After filming the new scene, Indy declared that he'd think of something even if he had to kill von Stroheim himself. During the duel scene being filmed the next day, Indy rolled marbles under von Stroheim's feet so it would look like he'd been shot and they'd have their death scene with which that could finish the movie.

On the set, von Stroheim could barely stay awake as he tried once again filming the duel scene. Von Stroheim ended up dramatically stumbling and falling after he was "shot" and Indy got the scene on film he needed to end the movie on the tenth and last day he was allotted.

Claire once again told Indy that she still had feelings for Tony, but Claire decided that if things worked out between her and Indy over the next two weeks she'd break up with Tony.

   While filming the next day a small earthquake hitted and a fire started in the house they were shooting a scene in. Ford continued to film and began improvising a new scene working the burning building into it. Filming continued without any problems over the next few days until one of the lead actors was killed in his sleep by a poisonous snake. Ford had Indy take over the deceased actor's role, however, Indy's lack of acting ability soon became evident. Indy improved over the next few days of filming, however, Ford found himself a day behind schedule and without any stuntmen after they are all injured on the set. Claire arrived to visit Indy after getting his letter. On the last day of filming, Ford had Indy act as a stuntman to complete the final scene to filmed - the runaway coach scene. Indy agreed to do it for extra pay and risked his life as he jumped from his horse to the wagon, missed and ended up underneath the wagon, being dragged on his back, pulling himself to the front where he grabbed hold of the reins and stopped the horses from going over a cliff. With the movie done, Indy said his farewell to Claire and everyone else and returned to the University of Chicago with a broken leg and enough money for tuition.

   trade a Navajo gold cache in exchange for a transmitter that could locate the skull when in appropriate range. While recovering the the gold, he met a Danish adventurer named
   Ulla Tornaes
   . The pair journeyed to
   New Orleans
   during Mardi Gras to settle the deal with Belloq. While a truce was called for and the transaction took place, Belloq gave Indy a bullet to the arm in addition to the coordinates to find the skull's canister.

The Nazis killed Alecia Dunstin who was in their custody along with the skull but were killed by supernatural forces. Afterwards, Jones finally took the Crystal Skull into his possession.

   Ceylon
   , now known as Sri Lanka. Ironically, it was Belloq that informed him of a rival that was after the same artifact; a mysterious German mercenary and adventurer by the name of
   Albrecht Von Beck

   Heart of Kouru Watu
   , in the middle of a sacred pool found within the ruins, guarded by an enormous albino crocodile. In a risky move, Indy baited the crocodile with his own body, and managed to trap him behind a large gate. He retrieved the artifact and got out of the water, just as the crocodile broke out of his cage. Unfortunately, Von Beck quickly caught up to Indy and forced him to relinquish the artifact at gunpoint. Indy agreed, but quickly took Von Beck by surprise, taking the artifact back and throwing the Nazi into the water with the crocodile. Indy escaped Ceylon with his life and the artifact.

Fighting off evil spirits in the catacombs, Jones quickly found himself in an underground temple and recovered the

After rescuing Mei Ying from Kong Tien's control, Indy finally recovered the artifact and he, Mei Ying and Wu Han opened the emperor's tomb outside Xi'an. Inside they found many cunning traps, but Indy managed to avoid most of them using the Mirror of Dreams. Marshal Kai and the Black Dragon Triad soon caught up with the group and they fought within the tomb. Von Beck, realizing that he had been double-crossed, entered the tomb himself where he met his demise while chasing Indy. Jones located the emperor's crypt and took the pearl. However the power of the artifact was too much for Indy to handle and it overwhelmed him. Indy dropped the pearl and it rolled right to Kai, who could handle its power as a loyal servant of Kong Tien. Despite Kai's immense power, including summoning a dragon, Indy defeated Kai with the

   Now, Indy was determined to finish what he came there to do. He confronted the Thuggees forcing the children to continue digging the tunnel in search of the final Sankara stones. Together with Willie and Shorty, he freed the children, who, in turn, helped the three overthrow the slavers. Indy was caught in a fight with a
   giant thug
   . The Maharajah, also revealed to be under the spell, held a voodoo-doll with the likeness of Indy in his hands, and stabbed it with a pin. Indy was struck with severe pain, and the thug got the upper hand. Shorty managed to beat the Maharadjah, and pulled the pin out of the doll. He also was able to free the Maharadjah from his spell after burning him with a torch. Indy could then defeat the thug, who was crushed to death at the end of a conveyor belt.

   The trio then made an attempt to escape on a mine car, but they were pursued by Thuggees. Through skill and a large amount of luck, the followers where lost, and Indy was able to stop the mine car with his feet, after the break had broken down. However, Mola Ram had released an enormous reservoir of water, which forced Indy, Willie and Shorty to take cover on the other side of the tunnel on the edge of a cliff on the side of a deep ravine.

  <p key="73c16e5f-dd7d-4433-a6b9-1145d80eb99a">
   Willie and Shorty started to cross the ravine on a crudely-built tree-bridge, as Indy fought off a band of Thuggees. On the bridge, they soon found themselves surrounded by more enemies. Mola Ram demanded the stones. Indy realized that he only had one option, and used his newly acquired sword to cut through the bridge. Indy, Willie and Shorty held on to one half of the bridge as it fell to the wall of the cliff. As they tried to climb up, Mola Ram confronted Indy, and tried to use his magic to pull the latter’s heart out. Indy started chanting in the Indian language, and by his words, the Sankara stones started to glow. They fell through the bag they were contained in, and as Mola Ram caught one of them it burned his hand. Indy then caught it as it had cooled down, and declared to Ram that he had betrayed Shiva. Mola Ram fell into the river, and was eaten alive by crocodiles. Captain Blumburtt and his band of 11th Poona Rifles arrived in time to shoot down the remaining Thuggees. Indy climbed up the cliff and was met by the relieved smiles of Willie and Shorty. In his hand he held the final stone.

   Indy, Willie and Shorty returned to the Indian village together with the lost children. The crops had started to grow once again. The children were reunited with their parents, and Indy returned the stone to the village elders. Willie suggested Indy should keep it, but he decided against it. Willie told Indy she wouldn’t follow him on any more adventures, but he caught her with his whip, and they embraced in a kiss.

   Jones tied off Le Roi's wound, but
   sharks
   were already drawn to their wreck. Trying to create a signal, Jones created a small fire using his and Le Roi's shirts. Before they could be finished off by sharks, they were rescued by Brody on a whaling ship. Aboard the ship, Jones locked up Le Roi, not willing to trust her. Reaching the coast of Siberia, Jones released her when she revealed that she had hidden a map copied off of the two pieces that von Hassell had first gained. Combined with a copy of the map that Jones had from the Beresford-Hope piece, Jones, Brody, and Le Roi set out on dogsled to catch up with von Hassell. Taking a shortcut across an ice bridge, they caught up with von Hassell's sledges, and Jones tried to rescue Beresford-Hope. A lightning strike caused the ice to open, and both teams fell into the chasm.

   . When von Hassell ordered Beresford-Hope to open the Tomb's doors or face death, Jones guessed that the younger man would give into his own curiosity, and was shocked when Beresford-Hope refused, and then was quickly cut down by von Hassell's blade. When several members of the Ahnenerbe group came under possession of the voices in the chamber and opened fire on the rest of their colleagues, Jones swung into the scene to save Brody, kicking down a
   blond gunman
   , and punching out a
   bald attacker
   , before trying to help Brody up with his satchel of dynamite. The pair were saved from a
   third gunman
   by Le Roi. Von Hassell used the key to open the massive doors, and entered the vault. Taking Brody's dynamite, Jones followed him inside. Von Hassell cut at Jones, and tried to get him to admit that they were both in this quest for the new knowledge. Jones agreed, but sought vengeance for Beresford-Hope's death, and to prevent the Nazis from getting the secrets, and dropped von Hassell into the pit, and ignited the dynamite and threw it in the pit as well. Running from the vault, Jones gathered up Brody and Le Roi and fled from the tomb before it collapsed from the explosion. Resting for a second, Jones was congratulated on his actions by Brody, and was held closely by Le Roi, who was a little disappointed in the lack of treasure.

When they entered the ancient building, they soon realized that the Chachapoyan Indians had constructed several lethal traps that one had to pass through alive in order to find the treasure. The entrance, for instance, was filled with giant tarantulas.
Soon Jones also discovered how Forrestal had met his end, when a bed of wooden spikes shot out from the tunnel with the remains of the rival archaeologist on it.

He realized, all too late, that his weight estimate had been wrong when the idol's pedestal sank into its table, and the temple walls started to collapse. Indy eluded poison darts that shot from the walls as Satipo used the bullwhip to swing to the other side of the chasm. Satipo demanded that Indy toss him the idol in exchange for the whip. Indy passed Satipo the idol, but the guide betrayed him and dropped the whip out of the archaeologist's reach. With great difficulty, Jones jumped to the other side of the chasm and made it under a stone slab before it slammed shut. He then found Satipo impaled on the same spikes that had killed Forrestal. Seconds later, Indy had to run away from an enormous boulder which had fallen from the ceiling.

With the help of Marion, and quite a sizeable chunk of luck, Indy killed the thugs. As the bar burnt down to the ground, Toht spotted the Headpiece, but the fire had made it so hot that it burned his hand. Marion, having lost her bar, gave Indy the Headpiece (which she had kept hidden all the time), and declared that she was going to be his partner for the rest of the journey.

   In the streets of Cairo, Indy and Marion were ambushed by Egyptians employed by the Nazis. A long chase, which included Indy having to shoot an
   Arab Swordsman
   , who had challenged him, to death and had Marion hide inside of a basket, ended when the basket was grabbed by Nazi agents, who appeared to put it in a truck. Indy fired a shot at the truck, not knowing that it was full of explosives, which resulted in its fiery destruction. Indy mourned the apparent death of Marion, and drunkenly confronted Belloq at a local bar. Belloq claimed that he and Jones really weren't too different from each other and that archaeology was their religion.

   Later, Indy and Sallah visited the scholar
   Imam
   , who translated the inscriptions on the Headpiece. They soon came to realize that the Nazis only had a copy of one side of the Headpiece. The Nazis lacked the back side, which contained the instruction to make the staff one kadam shorter than what the front side of the headpiece had said, in order to honor the hebrew God whose Ark it was.
  </p>
  <p key="035241c5-3cdc-43df-865c-a8158ca08eae">
   Indy and Sallah visited the dig site in the desert, and witnessed how the Nazis failed to obtain the Ark, as they were digging in the wrong place. Indy entered the
   Map Room
   , where a miniature model of the city of Tanis was found. He used his staff (with the right length) and, when the sun rose its light passed through the crystal in the headpiece, and made a beam which pointed at the spot where the Ark was buried.
  </p>
  <p key="32755698-3db3-4e06-922d-0b8da1a8aad1">
   Indy stumbled into one of the Nazi-tents, and there he found Marion - captured but alive. He decided that he better leave her there until later, so that his presence would not be discovered. At sundown, Indy and Sallah's band of diggers started to work. When night came, they reached a structure of stone. Under it they found the entrance to the Well of the Souls. Indy went down the rope first, but to his horror he fell right into a pit of thousands of poisonous snakes. Eventually he located the Ark, and having lifted it up with large wooden poles, Indy and Sallah brought it back to the surface. Indy didn't get the chance to escape the well as Belloq and his men had spotted them. Sallah was captured, and Marion was thrown down to accompany Indy in the underground well. As the entrance was sealed, Indy and Marion had to fight their way through the snakes at the same time as they desperately tried to find another way out. Indy used a large statue of Anubis to break the wall down, which made it possible to escape.

  <p key="4f41a7ca-a7c3-47ee-95f3-19c2af25b427">
   Outside they found that the Nazis where preparing to fly the Ark to Berlin in an
   advanced aircraft
   . Indy's plan was to steal the craft, but he was seen by some German mechanics. As Indy fought off an enormous
   German thug
   , Marion tried to get the plane started. The craft exploded due to leaked gasoline. The Nazis were then forced to transport the Ark to Cairo by truck. Indy rode after the truck on a white horse. An intense chase erupted, which finally ended when Indy was able to take control of the truck holding the Ark, and thanks to Sallah's connections in Cairo, they managed to get away.

   , which then took him to a military station, on an

   . Indy knocked out a short German guard and attempted to put on his uniform but it was too small. A larger German soldier appeared and Indy knocked him out and stole his uniform instead. From the station, Indy followed the Nazis on foot on their way to a secretly prepared outdoor altar where they planned to open the Ark. Indy tried to set Marion free by threatening to blow up the Ark with a bazooka, but Belloq called the bluff and Jones was captured.
  </p>
  <p key="de8e731d-5368-4723-9f7f-77334496732f">
   Indy and Marion were bound to a pole standing close to the altar. As Belloq began his Jewish recitations, the Ark was opened. Inside of it they only found sand. The sadistic Toht started laughing, but soon the silence was broken by an odd buzzing sound. Smoke and fog started to erupt from within the Ark, and soon what appeared to be heavenly spirits, or angels, rose and started to float above them. Indy told Marion to keep her eyes shut. As Belloq's excitement grew, the angels suddenly changed their appearances into what appeared to be ghoulish demons. The Nazis panicked and screamed in horror, as they were one by one killed and destroyed by lightning of fire coming from the Ark. The wrath of God had silenced those who had dared to look at the secrets of the Ark. The power of the Ark lifted all the bodies of the Nazis up into a huge storm that rose to the sky. Then the storm diminished, and it was quiet again.

   . Donovan also had in his possession a page from a manuscript written by a friar who chronicled the story of the knights. The text stated that two markers would lead the way to the Grail – and one of them was the stone tablet. As Donovan’s researcher recently had gone missing, he offered Indy the job of continuing the search for the Grail. Indy told him to ask his father, the real expert, but Donovan revealed that Indy’s father was the man who had disappeared.

   Indy and Brody went to Indy's father's
   house
   in Ferndale, and found it ransacked. Indy remembered the package from Venice, and opened it. Inside was his father's
   Grail diary
   ; a collection of all the research he had ever made in the quest. Indy decided to take the job, and together with Brody flew to Venice, where he was told to meet up with Donovan’s employee Dr. Schneider.

  <p key="53c2297e-eee8-47a9-a957-0c261128062a">
   In Venice, Indy and Brody met Dr. Schneider, who was in fact revealed to be a young woman with the first name
   Elsa
   . Elsa had been working with Henry until his sudden disappearance. The three went to an old church, now used as a library, which supposedly was the place where Henry was last seen. Finding clues in the wall paintings, Indy eventually realized that what they were looking for was a tomb – and that it was marked with an “X”. Indy and Elsa went down under the floor, and made their way through hundreds of rats, then they found the tomb of
   <a href="Richard.html" key="53d5f264-3ed7-43ae-a91d-e932b81bd7d3" title="Richard">
    Sir Richard

Meanwhile, Brody had been ambushed by a couple of fez-wearing men, who then tried to burn Indy and Elsa alive. They managed to survive by hiding under the tomb, and then sat out after their attackers on a boat. Eventually, Indy confronted their apparent leader, who said that his name was

   , on the German/Austrian border. Before they travelled there, Indy took the time to romance Elsa. Indy also took a look at the diary pages Brody had been given. The pages detailed the way to the hiding place of the Grail – in the

   Alexandretta

   Iskenderun
   .

  <p key="b91108a8-5a62-431f-901c-b9300146559e">
   When they arrived at Castle Brunwald, Indy and Elsa tried to gain entrance by impersonating a Scottish lord called Clarence McDonald and his assistant. The
   local butler
   was not convinced, so Indy had beat him down. Indy and Elsa discovered that the castle was a secret stronghold for Nazis. Indy used his whip to swing into the room where his father was held. Henry, thinking Indy was a German soldier, hit him in the head with a vase. Upon realizing that his son had come to save him, Henry was, for a moment, overjoyed with meeting his son for the first time in almost twenty years. Soon, however, a group of Nazis arrived. Indy confused them by bickering with Henry, and then to suddenly shoot them down with an MP40 machine gun. Despite of this, the Joneses were soon caught again. The Nazis had seemingly taken Elsa hostage as well, and used her as a bait in exchange for the diary. Henry told Indy that Elsa was in cahoots with the Nazis, but he didn’t believe it. Elsa then revealed that she was in fact a Nazi agent, and took the diary in her possession.
  </p>
  <p key="51a37a1b-745e-4bf5-99f7-8898f1ae0019">
   Indy and Henry were tied up to the same chair. Elsa realized that the diary was missing several pages, which had been given to Brody who had been sent to Iskenderun. Elsa passionately kissed Indy and left him and his father alone in the room. Henry managed to reach a lighter that Indy had brought with him, but burned his hand and in a reflex threw it at the floor, which then caught fire. The two had to move the chair away from the growing fire, and found themselves on one side of a moving wall. They were discovered by Nazi agents who alerted their colleagues. Indy and Henry then escaped on a motorbike. Followed by Nazis, Indy used his initiative to come up with ideas for how to get rid of them.

  <p key="67051a50-8ce8-4ef8-b2be-ffcbf5d023d8">
   Indy was able to fly the plane well enough for them to flee, but as Nazi pilots chased after them, Henry fatally damaged the plane by mistake, and they were forced to land. As they were pursued by a final plane, Henry thought up the idea to frighten off a flock of seagulls and making them crash into the plane. This made Indy look upon his father with a new kind of respect.
  </p>
  <p key="6ddc359f-35d6-4bad-9f54-e03ef33a5e08">
   Indy and Henry met up with Sallah in Iskenderun. Sallah informed them that Brody had been kidnapped by the Nazis, which meant that they also had the map in their possession. The three then travelled to the desert of the
   Republic of Hatay
   , where they eventually caught up with the Nazis. Suddenly a fire-fight broke out. The Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword had arrived in an effort to keep the Nazis out. However, they were all shot dead. Henry and Sallah made an attempt to rescue Brody and charged the Nazi tanks on horseback. As Indy was busy fighting off the Nazi soldiers, Henry sneaked into the tank where Brody was held prisoner, and tried to save him, but he was also captured by Colonel Vogel. Indy chased after the tank and fought with Vogel. He managed to free both Henry and Brody, but the tank rolled over a giant cliff. Indy threw himself off it at the last possible moment but Henry, Brody and Sallah all thought he had perished. As they were mourning at the top of the cliff, Indy joined them. He was embraced by his surprised father and they shared a brief moment of tenderness, before Henry told them to continue on their mission.

   With the help of the map, Indy and the others found the canyon, but they discovered that Donovan and Schneider had gotten there first. They arrived outside an ancient temple, carved into the mountain walls. Inside of it the Nazis were already attempting to get past the three obstacles one had to pass in order to reach the Grail. The first of these tests was “the breath of God”. As Indy and his friends were discovered, Donovan shot Henry in the stomach in order to force Indy to try and pass the tests. Indy had to recover the Grail if he was to save his father’s life.
  </p>
  <p key="f8fecf6d-22d7-4490-9410-be3590a43ed6">
   Indy stepped into the passage with the Grail diary in his hands. Henry had told him that only the penitent man would pass, which made Indy realize that as a penitent man he would have to kneel in front of God. As he kneeled, he barely kept his head from being cut off by giant razor blades. Indy grabbed a rope and hooked it on the blades, stopping them. The next test was “the word of God”. Indy entered a room where the floor was used as a checkerboard of cobblestones. He had to stand upon the written letters in order to pass. The word of God meant the name of God, and Indy instinctively stepped on the stone marked with a “J” (as in
   Jehovah
   ). The stone broke, and Indy almost fell to his death. He realized his mistake; in Latin Jehovah starts with an “I”. Indy passed the test, and came to the third and last riddle – “the path of God”. The passageway suddenly erupted, and Indy looked down at what appeared to be an abyss – at the other side of it the passageway continued. No one could possibly jump that far. Indy remembered the invisible bridge from a painting in his father’s house. He had to believe he could make the walk if he was to save his father. As he took the decisive step, he landed on solid ground, but he could not see what he was standing on. Indy realized that there was in fact a bridge – only it had been painted to look like it wasn’t there. It was an invisible bridge, which one truly had to believe existed in order to pass.
  </p>
  <p key="523141f7-c5a2-42e1-94c5-28fcaa149bbb">
   Indy stepped into the final room in which he witnessed an altar covered with hundreds of different grails. In front of the altar was an ancient-looking knight waiting. The knight (the last of the brothers who had sworn to protect the Grail) tried to confront Indy, but was too weak, and fell on his back. When Indy helped him up, the knight informed him that, as his vanquisher, he would now take his place. At that moment Donovan and Schneider entered the room. The knight told them that they had to be careful – only the right Grail would bring life, the others would take it. Schneider picked a
   gold grail with encrusted jewels
   for Donovan – from which he drank, convinced that it indeed was the Cup of Christ. Donovan started to age rapidly, and all too late realized that he had picked the wrong one. He rotted away in front of the others, and then turned to dust. Indy went to make his pick when his eyes fell on one that was different from the others – it was a simple cup, one that looked like it could have belonged to a carpenter. Indy drank from it, and the knight commended him, but warned him that the Grail could not be taken from the temple: that was the price of immortality.
  </p>
  <p key="357f4564-1654-4988-91fc-31dbff6ae672">
   Indy brought the Grail with him, and let his father drink from it. Henry was healed, and as they began to leave, Elsa grabbed the Grail and tried to run away with it. When she passed the great seal at the floor of the temple's entrance, the structure began to collapse. As Elsa desperately tried to reach the Grail caught in a large crack, she fell to her death. Indy almost made the same mistake, but his father convinced him to let it go when he for the first time called his son by the name of “Indiana”.

Based on Plato's tenfold error, Ubermann fed the machine with 1 bead instead of 10, which turned Kerner into a grotesque horned dwarf, who fell into the lava below. The Nazis then forced Indy to stand in the machine to be the target of the next experiment.

As the city was crumbling, Indy and Sophia made their way to the submarine and took it to the surface.

   – Indy's old girlfriend. Jones then deciphered
   Oxley's mumblings
   , and realized that they gave clues to the whereabouts of El Dorado. While everyone was distracted, Mutt seized the opportunity to escape by setting one of the tents on fire. Indy, Marion, Mutt and Oxley ran away, but stopped as Indy and Marion fell into a pit of dry
   quicksand
   . Thinking they were about to die, Marion revealed to Indy that Mutt’s real name was Henry Jones III, and that he was his son. Mutt threw them a large
   rat snake
   to use as rope to climb out of the pit. Indy was finally able to make his way out of the pit, even though his phobia of snakes made it difficult for him. The Russian soldiers arrived and captured them again.

   The following day, the Russians travelled through the thick jungle with a caravan of trucks, one of which was transporting Indy, Marion and Mutt. They took control over the truck, and Indy used an RPG to blow up the tree-wrecking Jungle cutter. A long and intense chase ensued as Indy and Mutt tried to reclaim the Crystal Skull from Spalko’s grasp. In the chaos, the skull happened to come into Oxley’s hands. The caravan soon stumbled into an acre of dry ground, which happened to be the nest of thousands of giant, vicious driver ants called
   siafu
   . The ants attacked, and Indy beat Dovchenko to his death as he fell into a pile of ants.

   Indy, Marion, Mutt, Oxley and Mac (who now appeared to be on Indy’s side) escaped by driving the truck over a cliff and landed on a huge tree. They then proceeded to fall through three vast waterfalls. Having survived this, they entered a cavern shaped as a human head. They passed a tunnel with carvings of people with unnaturally elongated craniums. They were then ambushed by a band of

   where they found thirteen crystal skeletons. Spalko, returning the Crystal Skull to the body of one headless skeleton, activated a force in the room that combined the thirteen bodies into a single living alien. While the alien endowed Spalko with the "great gift" of knowledge, Jones and the others escaped the crumbling Temple. Unfortunately for Spalko, the alien knew of her evil intentions and used its transfer of knowledge to overwhelm her human brain, causing her body to spontaneously combust. A portal opened in the ceiling of the Temple which the Russian soldiers were sucked into, as well as Spalko's remains and the remaining Russians. Mac's true loyalties remain ambiguous, since, though he appeared to be a Soviet double agent, Jones still tried to save him, trusting that that was the right thing to do. Mac, however, was humbled by his old friend, and went peacefully to prevent himself from delaying Indy's escape. It is unknown if he died or simply was "abducted" since the portal through which he disappeared was later actually revealed to be the bottom of a huge flying saucer.

   Following the Peru adventure, Jones was allowed to resume his teaching position at Marshall College, and was promoted to associate dean under Charles Stanforth, who also got his job back. With their relationship rekindled, Indiana and Marion wed soon after, with Harold Oxley and Charles Stanforth as witnesses.

   After nearly a century's worth of life experiences, he enjoyed relating stories of his youth to anyone he could get to listen. In
   1992
   , Indy confronted two youngsters who tried to skip class at the New York Museum. He told them the story of how he had gone to Egypt in

   He traded some baseball cards to
   Leo Tolstoy
   in 1909,
   taught the sport to
   Jiddu Krishnamurti

   played on his high school's baseball team in 1916,

   As an aficionado of the soprano saxophone, which he was introduced to while in basic training in La Havre, Jones later utilized his saxophone skills in 1918 Italy in an effort to impress a girl he liked.
   In 1920 Chicago, Jones played the soprano sax with Sidney Bechet, an event he looked back on fondly in 1950 while hiding from a group of thugs who were trying to steal his friend

   to stop a helpless little boy from being whipped to death, and he later attempted to (unsuccessfully) save the
   same man
   who tortured the boy from being crushed by a rock grinder. Complementing his compassionate character was an unshaking sense of integrity and respect for knowledge, believing that culture was something to be shared and preserved for future generations. However, Indy's belief that artifacts belonged in a museum earned him a fair share of enemies, along with a reputation as a graverobber in some countries.

   Jones' childhood hatred of snakes was taken to a new level in 1912, when he fell into a train car full of snakes. This resulted in Jones developing
   ophidiophobia
   . Albeit unsure, he considered that the incident in Utah may have also been the origin of a series of nightmares he had about being buried alive, which increased in frequency and ferocity until at least
   1934

Learning the language of the country was a lesson imparted to him on his first adventure in

   Jones had type O blood.
   Despite his adept physique and strength, Indy had low tolerance for alcohol.
   He also had astigmatism which he compensated against by wearing glasses,
   and used them for reading.
   Jones had himself written books, with one of his published works having been read by a young Mutt Williams under the encouragement of Harold Oxley.
   As an adult, Jones' outdoor equipment typically consisted of a
