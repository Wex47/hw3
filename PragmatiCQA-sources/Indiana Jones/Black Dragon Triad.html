   Members of the Triad were all males who wore red and black uniforms and grew their hair into a long braid. All members were seemingly exceptional in the field of martial arts. They inhabited the
   Black Dragon Fortress
   atop
   Peng Lai Mountain
   underneath which was built the Temple of Kong Tien, a holy place for their demonic deity. This section of the fortress was inhabited by vicious, animated corpses and disembodied spirits with whom Indiana Jones had to battle in order to rescue
   Mei-Ying
   from Kai's clutches. Here, Jones also discovered the
   Pa Cheng
   .
