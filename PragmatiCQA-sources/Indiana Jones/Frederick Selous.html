   Major
   Richard Meinertzhagen
   and based on his estimates, Big Mac and Birdy agreed that the cannon would be mounted and possibly sliding in the German railroad 30 miles inland. Selous then presented his men to the general and major, forcing a reluctant Indy to "volunteer" in.

   and rejoined the others.
  </p>
  <p key="43c20072-9ecb-428c-959a-184c0d137269">
   Having already pinpointed the position of the cannon that night, Selous ordered Indy and Birdy to take a flatcar he'd found while he and the rest would approach the train on the Daimler from another direction until they met the Train halfway where the road intercepted the lines some 20 miles down. At the joining point, he could see the Phantom Train in the distance, when it seemingly disappeared downhill. After puzzling themselves, Indy noticed that among their "toilet paper" was the ordering of 40 km of telegraph cable, which they found buried by the railroad. They followed the cable to an apparent dead end, before discovering the rock wall was fake.
  </p>
  <p key="c91b5a1b-d68a-40bd-9ba5-5a0ad6b01fbd">
   Discreetly, they entered the secret base-station, rode the train and placed dynamite according to Big Mac's orders. However on their way out, the timer did not blow as expected. Selous ordered Zoltan and Mac to reset the timer, while the Train started off for a new duty. After Indy neutralized
   Schultz
   , the shovel man, Selous tasked Indy to take his place, stalling them with blunders. The Train was eventually taken outside, while Selous and his men clung to its sides as Zoltan and Mac finished resetting all the timers.
  </p>
  <p key="48eeb157-c6b9-4ae4-858d-489b942b77ba">
   After Indy dispatched the drivers so that the band can climb aboard, the soldiers took notice of Zoltan and Mac. Zoltan isolated the wagons from the main engine before ropewalking back to the group on Mac's rope lasso. Once more, however, the detonation didn't go as planned and the cannon remained intact. Indy set the engine backwards to join up with the wagons, while Mac pinned the soldiers who stayed behind with the mounted machine gun; with the whole train once more, they decided to deliver it to the general. Unfortunately, in the distance they found the Germans destroying the tracks while an army was quickly closing in on them.
  </p>
  <p key="ccd09d3d-a107-4820-ac10-5fe5912ad28f">
   The Old and the Bold managed to stop the train and fled to 500 yards while the soldiers mounted the vehicle and disarmed the dynamite. Selous, "the best shot in Africa", according to little Indy years before, aimed at a pack of dynamite with his scoped rifle. Just as a German soldier removed the explosive from the mortar shells, Selous' bullet blew the dynamite taking out the armed wagon along with the rest of the train.

   While Indy tried to comfort Remy and explain about their delay on reporting to their Belgian unit, Smuts asked Selous if he would attempt the kidnapping their old nemesis,
   Colonel
   Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck
   . According to Meinertzhagen, von Lettow was to be found at a nearby lake, 35 miles southwest of their position, posing an extraordinary opportunity for his capture. When Indy and Remy showed up asking for a way to return to their unit with a letter explaining their absense, Selous once more managed to trick Indy and convince him that the best way to travel would be by a lake, right through the heart of the German territory, disguised as Boer settlers.

   On their way with the wagon, Selous noticed a courier on horseback, and again demostrating his marksmanship, shot and untied the saddle. The band approached the fallen courier, who was none other than
   Margaret Trappe
   , the daughter of a woman with whom he'd had an affair and considered the the best female aviator of Africa. The next morning, they were intercepted by Germans and taken to the camp of von Lettow, who Selous finally met face to face. After exchanging a handshake, von Lettow ordered them to be shot by morning.

   At night, Birdy, who was hidden in the wagon cache with captive Margaret, walked in and persuaded the sentry at gunpoint to release the prisoners. Having sabotaged a plane and the trucks, they entered von Lettow's tent and kidnapped him. Soon after, the camp was aroused and Selous and his men were riding a car driven by Parks when they saw Indy, Remy and von Lettow stuck in a hot air balloon hovering above them. Unable to return the three to the ground, Selous and his men abandoned the camp during the chaos.

   Several days later, the Old and the Bold was reunited with Indy and Remy, who had lost von Lettow, but Selous promised to finally get them to Lake Victoria.

   Frederick Selous, an explorer, officer, hunter, and conservationist, was famous for his exploits in south and east of Africa. His appearance as a character in the Indiana Jones franchise is of particular note since his adventures inspired Sir H. Rider Haggard to create the fictional
