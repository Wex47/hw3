   ", Dovchenko commanded the team that infiltrated Hanger 51. Pulling Jones and McHale out of the trunk of a staff car, his men stood aside as Dovchenko tried to question Jones about the building. After punching Jones in the jaw for not answering him, he was forced to give up when Spalko arrived and took over the operation.
  </p>
  <p key="9f2d2bdf-87ed-4ee3-a9ee-4af80fa3b703">
   After the
   Roswell remains
   were acquired, Jones escaped, Dovchenko caught up to the professor, and they crashed into the launch room for an experimental
   rocket sled
   . Dovchenko battled Jones, after being thrown through the glass into a control room, accidentally starting the ignition sequence. Dovchenko attacked Jones with a chain, but failed when the rocket sled activated and the two were shot out into the desert on a rail track incinerating some of Dovchenko's men in the process. The rapid speed rendered the Russian officer unconscious, and when it stopped, Jones was able to push him off the vehicle into the dirt and slipped away.

   Upon recovering, Dovchenko was found by some of his men who had followed the rocket sled's trail. Getting into a jeep, he commanded a second carload of troops to hunt down and kill Jones. Dovchenko himself returned to Spalko but Jones ultimately escaped. The Russian went to

   Infuriated with Jones for knocking him out twice, he gathered the straggling soldiers thrown out during the chase and the truck soon caught up to Jones' party - at a nesting site for a supercolony of
   siafu
   . Heedless of the ants, Dovchenko leapt out of the speeding truck and tackled Jones and Oxley to the ground, engaging Jones in a second brutal fistfight, which was allowed to continue unmolested by the ants due to Oxley's use of the

   . This time, Dovchenko managed to actually gain the upper hand in the brawl. Following being beaten upside the head with a log by Jones and then punched four times across the face consecutively, a dazed Dovchenko fell into the ant swarm. Dovchenko started screaming when the ants engulfed his entire body and dragged him headfirst into the nest, where he was devoured alive.

   Dovchenko became so consumed with fighting Jones to the point that he risked his own security, a trait which culminated in his death. He jumped off a truck carrying him to safety to face down Jones who was being pursued by the deadly
   siafu
   which were repelled by the Crystal Skull and created a natural arena in which the pair could do battle. Although able to absorb several blows to the head, Dovchenko was eventually knocked into the swarm which carried him to his doom.

   The way in which the ants killed Dovchenko by getting into his mouth to suffocate him is the technique that siafu use in real life to do away with their victims. Once they pass out, the siafu devour them. However, in real life, it's very easy to escape from the siafu by running, since these aren't as fast as they appear in the film. In addition, real siafu eat more

   and
   hyenas
   than humans, and seldom bring large prey to their anthill, they only devour them there.
