   . The inhabitants there tasked them to go to Pankot Palace and retrieve the Shive Linga, as well as their kidnapped children, who had been taken to work in the mines.
   Ram assigned his most senior priests with selling the diamonds the Mayapore children obtained.
  </p>
  <p key="df7cff1a-cd0a-4a70-b558-f5e2fbd3e2ac">
   The trio arrived at Pankot Palace, with Indy aware that it was once the center of activity for the
   <a href="Thuggee.html" key="c045da7b-861e-4604-957b-0f3526d1da89" title="Thuggee">

   , leading to them discover the resurgent cult and witnessed Mola Ram's Thuggee ceremony during which he sacrificed
   a victim
   by pulling out his heart and lowering him into a lava pit.
  </p>
  <p key="ed03f651-0d30-499d-aa71-ca09063548ed">
   When the Thuggee left the chamber, Indy tried to claim the Sankara Stones, which had been brought out during the ritual, but discovered the enslaved children, only to be captured himself after defending one from the
   Chief Guard
   . After Indiana Jones, Short Round and Willie were caught, Indy was brought before Mola Ram who revealed his goals to Indy and then had him drink the blood of Kali,
   turning him into one of them
   , and had Short Round imprisoned with the rest of the children. Mola Ram then spoke with Willie, who was terrified due the present situation.
   However, Ram was just messing with the singer's head.
   He was attempting to sacrifice her much like his previous victim, locking her in the same cage he previously used and directed Indy to carry out the task but as she was lowered into the lava pit below, the escaping Short Round returned Jones to his senses with fire, and they saved Willie and fought against the Thuggee. As Indy faced Mola Ram, the high priest escaped down a trapdoor. Indy and the others rescued the children, claimed the Sankara Stones and battled numerous Thuggee under Mola Ram's command as the three fled the catacombs via a mine cart.
  </p>
  <p key="8237fb05-4487-409a-a231-957b6914a23f">
   Mola Ram and his followers pursued them to a narrow rope bridge, where they had the trio cornered. As one of Ram's henchmen held Willie hostage, Jones demanded she be released but Mola Ram refused, confident that he had the upper hand. Jones then threatened to drop the Sankara Stones into the river below. Ram called his bluff, declaring that the stones would be found, but Jones surprised Mola Ram by cutting the bridge, a move which sent many of the Thuggee warriors to their deaths in the
   crocodile
   infested waters.
  </p>
  <p key="7eccb770-eca2-4005-b31e-445574b00d8e">
   Mola Ram clung to the remnants of the bridge, however, and continued his battle against Jones, even going so far as throwing
   one of his own surviving men
   off the bridge in an attempt to dislodge the archaeologist. As Mola Ram and Jones struggled for control the stones, Jones' invocation of
   Shiva
   caused the stones to glow red hot. The move caught Ram off guard. As he tried to take one of the Sankara Stones, it burned his hand and made him lose his balance. Mola Ram lost his grip on the bridge, and fell into the river below, where the crocodiles shredded his body and devoured him.

  <p key="cac6e5d2-00e7-4be7-a4dc-a09cdc5803e2">
   Following Mola Ram's demise, people searched the river and found no signs of his body. Rumors began to circulate that his body had disappeared from the river and, despite statements by the British that the High Priest was dead, they were unable to provide any evidence to prove it, moving to punish anyone who publicly said otherwise. Maharajah Singh also publicly declared Mola Ram deceased and offered $2,500 to anyone that could provide proof or information on who might have taken the body.
  </p>
  <p key="34ba1972-635a-4a99-92e0-a8ca60b4adc1">
   However, the stories circulating that Mola Ram haunted the ruins of the flooded "Temple of Doom" pleased both parties, as Singh and the colonial authorities were keen on keeping others away from the area. The British kept an eye out in order to prevent Lal from creating another Temple of Doom like the one Ram ran.

   Mola Ram was a strong worshipper of the Hindu Goddess of Death, Kali, and was devoted to conquering the world and ruling it in her name. He was also highly devoted to the Thuggee cult that he led, and wished to make them, and himself, all-powerful. He showed himself to be a cruel, heartless, sadistic, ruthless, psychopathic, power hungry and even genocidal man. He enjoyed, and was happy to cause, the suffering of others, sacrificing innocents in horrific ways, torturing his enemies and brainwashing them into becoming his subordinates, and even kidnapping innocent children and enslaving them to support his cause. Mola Ram also disregarded his own allies, throwing
   one of them
   to his death and even chuckling at his demise.
