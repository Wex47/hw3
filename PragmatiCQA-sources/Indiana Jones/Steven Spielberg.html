    Steven Allan Spielberg
   </b>
   , KBE (born December 18, 1946 in
   Cincinnati
   ) is an American film director. He has won three
   Academy Awards
   (as well as an Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award), and is among the most successful filmmakers in history, in terms of both critical acclaim and popular success. His films have however also been derided as the archetype of modern Hollywood blockbuster film-making (commercialism over artistic purposes).

   First coming to attention directing adventure films, Spielberg is noted in recent years for his willingness to tackle emotionally powerful issues, such as the horrors of the Holocaust in

   Spielberg is the most financially successful motion picture director of all time. He has directed and/or produced an astounding number of major box office hits, giving him great influence in Hollywood. As of 2004, he has been listed in Premiere and other magazines as the most "powerful" and "influential" figure in the motion picture industry.

   <i key="8997770e-7d28-4313-bee9-371cae68fa7e">

   His friend George Lucas immediately pulled Spielberg back in as part of their friendly agreement to make more Indiana Jones movies. Plagued with uncertainty for the material, the saving grace for Spielberg during the making of this film would be the meeting of his future wife
   Kate Capshaw
   , who was cast as Indiana's new love interest.

   The film was a hit though the reviews were less positive than they were for its predecessor. It was criticized for lacking the energy of the original, as well as for its grossly inaccurate and ignorant depiction of Indian culture. The extreme violence and gore would also inspire the Motion Picture Association of America to create the PG-13 rating the following year at Spielberg's request. Lucas, the story writer, has said that it was due to his bad mood. When he wrote the story, he had just divorced. Therefore, he was in a bad mood. This caused the violence that the film was criticized for.

   , Spielberg vicariously fulfilled a lifelong dream to make a James Bond movie. Lucas himself heralded his Indiana Jones creation as an alternative to Bond back when they first discussed films to work on together. The father-son issues in the picture are congruent with much of Spielberg's work, making this Indy film the most personal of the three. Receipient of glowing reviews and big box office receipts, Spielberg, Lucas and Ford left the franchise on a high mark.

   Spielberg's films often deal with several recurring themes. Most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances. In an AFI interview in August 2000 Spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extra terrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films. Spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood, and his interest came from his father, a science fiction fan, and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest, but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge.

  <p key="a96ae0d1-0c12-47bd-9099-ab8452534923">
   A strong consistent theme in his family-friendly work is a childlike, even naïve, sense of wonder and faith, as attested by works such as
   <i key="84e2d907-bef1-48e6-9804-71e5ea66d9fb">

    A.I. Artificial Intelligence

   . According to Warren Buckland, these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children

   are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In

  <p key="74aff862-1e4c-4129-92e3-2acf7f300343">
   The most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships. Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in
   <i key="72dbe4d6-f1ba-4345-b6b6-9286e2411eba">

   starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of his film regains the respect of his children. The notable absence of Elliott's father in

   , it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son "self reliance," which is not how Indy saw it). Even Oskar Schindler, from

   is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, most notably
   <i key="ae2f05c1-ea89-4e15-bfb3-0c81156ffef9">
    E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial

   <i key="1b95d260-c29f-4a50-8773-73c1b34b0c37">

   (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in
   <i key="acbe1d78-efc6-49b6-ac91-6f7b0794ab18">
    Jurassic Park
   </i>
   (early in the film, another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim. However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders.

  <p key="d4bdce18-0e61-4aea-a04c-b60ebe306e12">
   Most of his films are generally optimistic in nature. Critics frequently accuse his films of being overly sentimental, though Spielberg feels it is fine as long as it is disguised. The influence comes from directors Frank Capra and John Ford.

   A video essay titled
   "The Spielberg Face"
   focuses on Spielberg’s use of close-ups throughout his career. This essay makes the case that Spielberg has deployed the venerable cinematic technique as skillfully, and as thoughtfully, as anyone before or since, using it to depict everything from "sudden shock or creeping dread" to "the trauma of remembering the past, or of confronting the future, discovering humanity in another person, or discovering humanity in oneself." Spielberg has used the close-up as a stand-in for the audience’s reaction to the movies, and that, through his close-ups, Spielberg has interrogated that reaction, and its meaning, in film after film, starting with
   <i key="e7a50da8-2ec1-4669-8183-596d67cb50bc">
    Close Encounters of the Third Kind
   </i>
   . The essay calls this work the "breakthrough" for the director, a movie that is less about aliens than it is "about Spielberg discovering the full power of the face" and exploring "the perpetual wonder of seeing things new." The essay moves forward through Spielberg's work, stopping at A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, which it calls Spielberg’s "most profound" reflection on the face and what it reveals.
