   Arnold Ernst Toht

   Ilsa
   .
   As with the rest of his fellow

   brethren, Toht was trained in the art of combat, interrogation, torture, and espionage, and was well-versed in mysticism and the belief in Aryan society. Over time, Toht became a skilled torturer and interrogator, relishing the opportunity to inflict pain and suffering even for its own sake, and a firm believer in the

   All the henchmen who went into the bar with Toht died during the ensuing fight with Jones and Ravenwood, during which Marion's bar was set ablaze. While Indy was grappling with a large thug, Toht dispassionately ordered both shot, but his henchman was quickly dropped by four bullets from his would-be victims and Toht scrambled for cover. Crouching next to a table, Toht noticed the headpiece lying on the ground during the skirmish and tried to grab it, but the bronze relic had been heated by the flames throughout the fight and began sizzling the moment he gripped it, searing its ancient design into his flesh. Screaming in agony, Toht sprinted across

  <p key="fda70a20-2970-4104-8bad-2d8abf16c693">
   Frustrated with Belloq's inability to extract useful information from the (now captive) Marion Ravenwood, Dietrich had Toht intercede. His own interrogation proved equally fruitless however. When the Nazis finally caught up with Jones at the Well of the Souls, Toht threw Ravenwood into the Well under Dietrich's orders, for they had no further use for her. Belloq's protest against the action caused Toht to giggle with glee.

   He later accompanied Belloq and his fellow Nazis in the effort to deliver the Ark to a safer location, since his duty was to oversee the delivery of the artifact Hitler desired. However, Jones succeeded in
   taking the Ark
   back from them. Toht and the others located his whereabouts later on and reclaimed the Ark along with Marion.

   along with the rest of the Nazis including Belloq and Ravenwood. While walking to the
   Tabernacle
   , where the ceremony was going to be performed, Jones resurfaced and threatened to blow up the Ark unless Ravenwood was released, but Belloq distracted him long enough to be captured.
  </p>
  <p key="262764a2-91e6-482e-a1c4-15ea35e7caca">
   That night, Toht stood with Belloq and Dietrich in the Tabernacle for the ceremonial opening of the Ark. Initially, the Ark seemed to bear only dust and sand, which was all that was left of the Ten Commandments; this amused Toht, who never quite believed in the supernatural imperative of his assignment, and the despair of Belloq on top of that had him burst into laughter. His enjoyment was cut short, however, as a power surge destroyed all equipment in the vicinity of the Ark before apparitions began to emanate from within the gilded gold chest.

   The astonished Toht watched as one of the spirits approached them. Appearing as a youthful woman, the entity's visage gave way to a terrifying fanged countenance that snarled at the assembled Nazis.
