   , grave robbers. The discovery nearly ended in disaster, with one of the local workers killed by booby traps and, for a short while, Jones and Bernard were sealed inside the pyramid.  They were then pulled out of a exit hole for bats, only to find that the other archaeologists were held captive by the grave robbers. Jones was able to rescue the rest of the team by escaping and killing one of the grave robbers.  However, Jones' arm was grazed by one of the attacker's bullets.
