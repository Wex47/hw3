Indiana requests gunpowder, since the box's contents are highly magnetized, and he uses it to guide him to the box. After they find its approximate location, Jones uses cracked shotgun shells to find the crate. When the crate is found and opened up, a humanoid form is seen wrapped in a silver material. Spalko cuts open the silver material, but before she can see the crate's contents, Jones hits a Russian and steals his gun, and he takes another gun using his whip and gives it to Mac.

   Threatening to shoot Spalko, Indy is in complete control of the situation, until Mac turns his gun on his friend. Mac walks over to the Soviet side, and after Spalko asks if Jones has any "defiant last word" Jones simply replies "I like Ike" and he tosses the gun on the floor which causes it to fire, distracting the Soviets and giving the archaeologist the chance to get away. Spalko tries to drive off with the crate, and Jones tries to swing onto the jeep but misses and crashes through a truck's windshield, saying: "Damn! I thought that was closer.", and promptly knocks the drivers
   Jefferson
   and
   Grant

   Hoover
   inside and tries to escape, but an infuriated Dovchenko attacks him, and they fall through a skylight into an underground room with the rocket sled, which is activated when the Colonel is kicked through a glass pane into a control room. A few Russians and Mac arrive to help Dovchenko, but the sled is activated, incinerating several soldiers as Jones and Dovchenko are rocketed through a tunnel and out into the desert by the sled on which they were fighting. Meanwhile Spalko gets on another car, picks up Mac and congratulates him on a job well done.

   Indy gets away because the ride leaves Dovchenko unconscious, and a squad of Russians give pursuit in a car. Stumbling through the desert, he finds "shelter" in a small town, but finds that there are no inhabitants other than various mannequins. When a warning siren sounds, Indy (and the three pursuing Russians

Seconds later, the bomb detonates, and "Doom Town" is totally obliterated. The Russians and their car are ripped apart by the blast wave, but the fridge containing Indy is blasted across the desert, and protects him from the deadly radiation.

   As they journey into a grave, a huge scorpion stings Mutt, but Indy tells him not to worry, with scorpions "the bigger, the better". The two continue and eventually find seven mummified beings at the bottom of the grave. They open one, and the corpse considerably disintegrates seconds after being exposed to the air (the mummified shrouds had preserved the corpse for several hundred years). Mutt and Indy soon discover that a second corpse has already been opened. Jones picks up some golden coins and these fly towards the corpse in the bandages. Mutt is given Francisco de Orellana's armor-clad corpse to hold while Indy looks for the crystal skull in the bandages. After he finds it, Mutt's blade is immediately pulled towards the skull. Both of them note that neither gold nor crystal is magnetic. As they emerge from the tomb, they find themselves surrounded by Soviets, including Mac, Dovchenko and Irina. Jones and Williams are taken to a Soviet camp in the middle of a jungle.

   A drunken Mac stumbles into the tent where Indy is being held with his hands and feet strapped down and talks about why he betrayed him, and, when Irina enters, Mac simply says that this is all "...

Both Jones and Spalko partially locate the temple of Akator by figuring the Amazon river to be "the great snake" and that a dream Oxley had written about on his ideograms refers to a river called Sono, Portuguese for sleep/rest. While everyone is distracted, Mutt seizes the opportunity to punch a Soviet soldier and overturn a table, cuing the group's escape. Spalko and the soldiers are about to give chase but Mutt sets one of their tents on fire. When Indy and Marion fall into a
   dry sand pit
   , Mutt runs off to get something to pull them out with. While they are sinking Marion reveals that Mutt is Indy's son, to which Indy reacts by arguing with Marion about letting Mutt quit school, despite the fact that he had told Mutt that if it felt wrong then he shouldn't do it, he should've done what he wanted to do. Mutt returns with a huge rat snake and Marion easily climbs out, however, Indy has a harder time due to his phobia of snakes, so they call it a rope and Indy eventually makes it out. Oxley, told to get help, loosely interprets the message and leads Spalko and the soldiers as "reinforcements".

   The next day, Spalko and some soldiers travel in a car through the jungle along with a small caravan of trucks and cars, one which is transporting Oxley, the Skull, Mac and some soldiers, all led by the beastly
   Jungle Cutter
   . In a truck at the tail of the caravan, Dovchenko guards their bound prisoners: Jones, Ravenwood, and Williams. Marion takes the time to tell Mutt that Jones is his real father. Mutt doesn't believe it, and Jones and Marion end up arguing about their past. Colonel Dovchenko, tired of the argument, eventually gags Marion. Jones and Mutt use the opportunity to kick the Colonel into unconsciousness. After freeing themselves, they take control of the truck, and Indy finds a RPG and blows up the tree wrecking vehicle, which surprises Spalko. Indy, Mutt and Marion leave the truck they were being held captive on after it is nearly split in two by the Cutter's blades, which were sent flying after the vehicle's explosion. A lengthy chase ensues after Indy, Marion and Mutt jump into a "duck" (an amphibious vehicle) to try and recapture the Stolen Skull, leaving the knocked out Colonel in a driver-less vehicle. Spalko has her soldiers drive towards the car with Oxley and Mac in it so she can retrieve the Crystal Skull. After Indy jumps from the duck to the other car, he punches and throws all the Soviets out except for one who clings to the back. Indy nails Mac a few times and as, he drives the car, Mac reveals he is really CIA. Spalko begins ramming into Indy's car and the back-hanging Russian climbs back up and manages to throw the skull at Spalko before finally falling of. Mutt and Marion drive by and Mutt uses one of Spalko's swords to retrieve the skull. Irina is finally forced to draw out her rapier as she engages Mutt in a battle for the skull. She beats him out and even wounds him right above his right eye. The skull ends up in Oxley's hands again after a brief scuffle and Irina unknowingly passes over to Marion's car. She is about to stab Ravenwood but she is suddenly thrown onto the car's hood after Marion slams the brakes. Spalko holds onto a gun that was on the duck's hood and she frantically begins to shoot at the windscreen, while Mutt fights the Soviet driver for the skull on another car. After regaining control of herself, Irina climbs further onto the hood and takes aim straight at Marion, who thinks fast and manages to throw the Soviet doctor onto another car. However this happens to be the car with Mutt on it and after a brief fight with him, Irina kicks him in the head while he holds her down and after kicking Mutt off her car (who lands on Jones' car), she retrieves the skull. Mutt meanwhile winds up getting tangled in some vines and is lifted onto a canopy away from Indy's car.

   Dr. Spalko takes over the car she is on by pushing the
   Russian Driver
   into the back of the car. She then begins to ram the car into Indy's so he'll fall off the cliff they were driving next to, prompting the remaining Russian on Dr. Jones' car to jump of the car's back. She is about to drive the famed archaeologist off, even taunting him with a perfectly delivered "Do svidaniya, Dr. Jones". Suddenly Mutt, who got the idea from watching a group of
   monkeys
   , swings in on a vine and lands on Spalko's car, along with about a dozen or so monkeys that followed him. Mutt takes back the skull and jumps onto Indy's car, and they drive away from the cliff while Spalko is harassed by several monkeys. After stabilizing the situation and getting rid of all the monkeys by throwing them out of the car (even throwing one off the cliff in her rage), she keeps up her pursuit of the part-time professor.

   Indiana, distracted by his recently arrived son who has finally nabbed the skull, crashes through some foliage and into a pile of dirt and some logs. Soon after Spalko and the soviet driver crash through the same foliage and nearly decapitate Indiana, Mutt, Oxley and Mac by driving over them as she crashes into another dirt mound. As the dust clears Indy and his gangs notice that Spalko is pointing her gun at them, however she hesitates when a large red ant bites her hand. Smashing the ant Spalko thinks that’s it, but soon a swarm of them file into the cars from beneath, revealing the dirt pile to be a colony of vicious
   siafu

Mutt turns around to help his father, but Indy tells him to run, he’ll be fine. Marion appears, driving the badly beat up amphibious vehicle and tells Mutt and Mac to jump in. Both the driver and Irina flee, however the Soviet soldier just wasn't quick enough and he is devoured by the massive amount of ants after he succumbs to their biting. The Soviet doctor climbs onto a log but that just isn’t enough; the ants start climbing up the dried log. Noticing a vine above her, Spalko quickly jumps up and begins to climb up for her life.

   While Dovchenko and Indiana duke it out, the ants begin to swarm around Oxley, who is just lying on the ground. When he pulls out the skull, however, the carnivorous insects go around the skull, as if it were creating some kind of barrier. The ants begin to pile up in an attempt to reach Spalko, and one even succeeds in climbing up her leg; however it meets a grisly end when it is crushed between her thighs. Jones and the Colonel fight inside the skull protective range, and, just when Indy is knocked down to the floor and it looks like the Colonel is winning, the archaeologist picks up a small log and beats up the Soviet Colonel until he falls back, right into the swarm of army ants. They all pile up on him and, when he screams, they even crawl into his mouth. Dovchenko is carried into the anthill and he disappears, along with the ant swarm, which almost takes Indy's fedora with them, but he repels them with the skull's power.

   Indy picks up Ox and carries him to Marion and the car, meanwhile a small Soviet car comes to Spalko's aid, and she just drops down onto the passenger seat. The soldier loaded truck parks on the cliff's edge and all the soldiers and their leader begin to climb down some ropes that they just secured. Marion drives the car with all the good guys in it off the cliff, but it lands on a huge tree that was growing on the ravine's side. They are gently lowered in to the river below, and the tree recoils and hits the cliff wall, knocking down several Soviet soldiers. Realizing that when Oxley said, "Three times it drops." he meant that there were three waterfalls that lead to Lake Sono; everyone panics as the first waterfall approaches. In the end though, they all survive after they plummet through the three progressively higher waterfalls.

   The group enters a cavern shaped like a human head with a waterfall sprouting from its eyes (Oxley had said that the temple was found by going "Through eyes I last saw in tears.") and they journey through a tunnel with paintings of beings with "elongated craniums". Ox holds up the skull in front a life-sized painting and there is a perfect match. It is read in the pictograms that the

   Spalko finds what appears to be a tracking device at the shore of the lake, and she looks up at the cave where another tracking device was probably dropped. Mac is upset by the fact that he hasn't seen any gold yet after climbing up a Mayan pyramid with an obelisk over key. Jones figures out that to open the "Palace of Eternity" the obelisk needs to move, so everyone begins to break some ornate stone heads that hung in a stone structure beneath the obelisk. Breaking a lot of the heads causes sand to pour out, and the obelisk to rise up. The group is sucked underground, but the stone steps on which they fell begin to draw back into the wall, so they are forced to run down the tube-like structure to avoid being impaled by the stone spikes waiting in the water below. No one makes it all the way down in time, so they all plummet about seven meters into the water; Oxley drops the skull and he frantically begins to look for it. Indy and Marion share a tender moment and are about to kiss when Mutt unexpectedly drops a heavily armored skeleton into Indy's arms. The skull is found and Mac steals some gold from an armored figure that was impaled on one of the spikes. Indy leads the way into the temple through a door on the side, and Mac is seen dropping a flashing silver and red tracking device on the ground.

  <p key="8a7c264a-4673-47a7-a45b-15ea205231fa">
   Outside, the Ugha are brutally gunned down, and Spalko kneels to pick up yet another tracking device. Indy is very impressed by what is found in the chamber that they have just entered, artifacts from all over the world. Everyone eagerly looks around, Mutt exclaiming that the place was the mother load, and Mac commenting on how any museum in the world would sell its soul for the trove stored in there. Ox walks towards a huge red door, and Indy notices that a skeleton was carved in the middle of the door, so he borrows the crystal skull and he places it in the head part of the carving, where the skull fits snugly. A giant red arrow comes down on the door and each half retracts into its corresponding side, revealing a tunnel.

  <p key="03530a2d-ee5d-40e5-8c9a-f873e9f76256">
   Everyone climbs in, and, as they examine the thirteen crystal skeletons, all of them sitting in ornate gold thrones, Ox moves towards the one with no head. Just as skeleton and head are about to be reunited, a gun clicks in the background and Mac is seen pointing his gun at Ox, forcing him to back away from the skull. Indy asks Mac if he's a triple agent and Mac just retorts by explaining that he just lied about being CIA. Just then Spalko and four Soviet soldiers walk in to the chamber, and the Russian doctor comments on how beautiful the skeletons are. She also notes "They are a hive mind, of separate bodies but of a single mentality."

   Irina takes the missing skull and puts it back where it belongs, this causes the once headless skeleton to straighten, taking the upright pose of the other twelve. It is then that Harold Oxley begins to talk in Mayan. Indy translates and explains that the skull is "Grateful for being returned, and that it would like to give them a gift." Irina asks the Crystal Skeleton to grant her knowledge as the gift that they had offered, repeating the same line over and over "I vant to know, I vant to know". Mac takes advantage of the fact that everyone is distracted and he slips out into the previous chamber, where he is about to escape, but is held back by his greed. True to their word, the skeletons transfer all their knowledge into the doctor's mind, their eyes begin to emanate smoke, and the room begins to rotate. A portal opens up above the room, and Marion notes that it is "the eyes, Indy, it's the eyes". Mutt asks if the skulls are aliens, and Oxley, now sane again, states that they are "Interdimensional beings in point of fact". Indiana throws Ox and Marion out of the chamber, and then waits for the passage to rotate back into position so both he and Mutt can escape. They barely exit the chamber before the portal begins to lift up pieces of the room, along with the four surviving soldiers, who are sucked in by their weapons and ammo belts. After nothing is left in the chamber except for a tall column in the middle, where Spalko is standing receiving streams of knowledge, the still rotating skeletons begin to converge, starting form the left, into one. Indy, Mutt and Marion run to escape the now collapsing temple, however Mac is still trying to gather treasure.
  </p>
  <p key="d45e8ebf-c90c-48c9-8350-a3b3983e6215">
   Indy turns back and shouts at him, saying that they have to leave "... Now, damn it!" Unfortunately Mac trips, and being covered in gold, is not able to get up without being sucked in by the portal. Indy throws the whip for him to hold on to. Mac is humbled by this act. As more and more of the temple is absorbed, he decides that he'll no longer slow down his friend’s escape, saying "I'll be all right." He lets go of the whip and is sucked into the portal. Meanwhile, all the skeletons have merged into one being, and Spalko is still taking in all the wisdom being given to her, however her psychic link made her far too fragile and her body was far too weak to sustain all the knowledge being sent to her. She asks for it to stop, but the being silently refuses to. It becomes apparent that it knew Spalko's evil intentions, which explained why the skull would not speak to her previously. Its eyes turn green and it gives a menacing look as it continues to transfer knowledge. A raging fire starts in Spalko's brain and emerges through her eye sockets. The inferno rapidly spreads to her whole body, disintegrating her. Indy and the rest of the group run through the temple while giant stone wheels wreck what remains. Soon they find themselves at a dead end, and with the sound of raging water in the distance, their chances look slim. However, the water fills up the tunnel, and, by keeping themselves afloat, everyone makes it out all right.

  <p key="3aed7648-f9a8-4b47-b5c1-8a772442f83c">
   Just as Indy stands up, a giant dark gray saucer is seen taking off from the base of the temple, lifting many pieces of rock and tossing them around or turning them into dust. Finally in a flash of light, the saucer disappears, and the floating pieces of debris drop to the empty valley floor below. Parts of the upper rim keeping out the river water give way, and immediately fill up the void where the temple once stood. "Like a broom to their footsteps", states Harold Oxley. Jones beckons Marion to sit on his lap, and both of them hug; When Mutt insists that they should move before it gets dark, Jones gets him to stay by calling him "junior". Mutt, in response, calls Indiana "dad", which confuses Oxley.

   Howard Roffman, President of Lucas Licensing, stated the film would have a large marketing campaign, which he attributed to it being "nineteen years since the last film, and we are sensing a huge pent-up demand for everything Indy".
   Paramount will spend at least $150 million to promote the film,
   whereas most film promotions range from $70 to 100 million. As well as fans, the film also needed to appeal to younger viewers unimpressed by an older Indiana.
   Licensing deals include Expedia, Dr Pepper,

   production reported the missing items to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department on September 24, 2007. Marvin Levy, Steven Spielberg's spokesman, said the director was concerned that the thieves would try to sell the materials,
   and on October 2, the people believed to be involved in the burglary sent out e-mails to several entertainment gossip websites offering to sell the images. According to IESB,
   TMZ.com
   obtained some of the stolen property and was on the verge of running the story on its TV division until
   Paramount
   lawyers stepped in. After Paramount was notified about the emails, they contacted sheriff's investigators. A member of the online press helped the detectives by posing as a potential buyer and setting up a meeting in
   West Hollywood
   . When the seller arrived, he was arrested on suspicion of receiving stolen property.
   On October 4, Roderick Eric Davis, age 37, was charged with one felony count of receiving stolen property.
   He later plead guilty to two felony counts and will serve two years and four months in jail.

We're gonna have a bunch of angry people saying, ”You’re a bunch of a–holes, you should never have done this. You’ve ruined my life forever.

   Lucas, Spielberg, and Ford turned down large upfront salaries so Paramount could cover the film's costs. Paramount will only see a profit beyond its distribution fee if it grosses over $400 million. At that point Lucas, Spielberg, Ford, and those with smaller profit-sharing deals will also begin to collect their cut.

    Spielberg spokesman Martin Levy explained, "[Indy is] such a well-known character that it's not like you have to get out there and introduce something new [...] We also want[ed] to keep a lot of the surprises. That's part of the fun."
    Reaction to the trailer was generally positive, with criticism over the number of alleged computer-generated effects.
    A shot of Indiana Jones and Mac was digitally altered for the American version so that the surrounding soldiers' guns are pointed down. Mac's belt, Indiana Jones' breast pocket and a background soldier's gun were computer-generated into the shot. Critic Drew McWeeny wrote, "What we're left with as our first glimpse in 19 years of this character that is so much a part of the film lives of a generation is this distracting, fuzzy, fucked-with image that will be fixed in the film anyway." The
    American flag
    is not seen in some versions of the international trailer.
    Paramount hailed it as the most-watched trailer in the company's history, with around 200 million views online in its first week alone.
