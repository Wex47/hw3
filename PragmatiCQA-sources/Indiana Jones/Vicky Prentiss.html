Growing up, Prentiss became fluent in Welsh from her mother's background and songs, and picked up other languages through her father's custom to have her learn the native language of the country where they were living.

   In 1916, Prentiss was working in London as a ticket collector. In May of that year, she encountered

   —who did not pay special attention to her because she was collecting tickets on the bus where Jones was already trying to seduce a young war widow, whom Prentiss had given a pro-suffrage flyer. After being rejected by the woman, Jones continued the bus ride along until the bus was forced to stop due to the upcoming attack of a

   zeppelin—something Jones had not seen up to that point and did not fear at the start as a result. Prentiss tried to save his life by moving away from the gasoline-filled bus to a supposed safer place, which ended up being nearer to a zeppelin bomb hit. As they were knocked down by the bomb explosion, they shared a close moment and he noticed her beauty. However, she refused to meet him again, and after the bus resumed service, he got off at Paddington Station.

   the courage to continue. After the meeting, she accepted Jones' invitation to get tea, where they realized that they had both traveled extensively as children, she as the daughter of a diplomat, and he as the son of a world-traveling lecturer. As they walked in the park after the tea, they encountered a single mother forced onto the streets with her children. Prentiss was impressed by Jones' compassion in arranging for the children to get a bite to eat and ability to provide help to the woman in making her rent to avoid eviction without her feeling like she had accepted charity. Reaching her home, Jones asked to see her again, and she agreed to take a trip with him the next day to

   , Jones' former tutor. Prentiss felt a little out of place with her beau's submissiveness to the older woman, who had also known Prentiss' father. Prentiss and Seymour verbally sparred over the issue of women's suffrage - Seymour was sympathetic to the cause, except for the drastic measures that had been used to bring attention to the cause. Despite feeling like she had insulted her host, Prentiss was relieved to find out from Jones that Miss Seymour liked her and had invited them to accompany her as guests at a dinner party with
   Winston Churchill
   .

  <p key="89fe71fb-52f6-47e1-b4e6-e10ff013112b">
   At the dinner party, when Churchill discussed the issue of allowing the military men abroad to vote, Prentiss brought up the issue of women's right to vote. Jones kept trying to change the subject, but Churchill and Prentiss argued, and she ended the dialogue by accidentally launching part of her dessert - a trifle at the guest of honor, which landed on his head. Embarrassed, she fled from the dinner party. The next morning, she apologized to Seymour, and explained why she felt so strongly about women's suffrage - her mother, an early suffragrist, had been made disabled after being forcibly fed during a prison hunger strike. Seymour felt that if she had been in Vicky's place, she would have done the same thing at dinner, even the dessert mishap.

   Realizing that she could use a vacation, Prentiss contacted her work and took a bit of an extra holiday, and took Jones to meet her parents near
   Malvern
   . They bicycled around the British countryside, where their romance continued to bloom, and they professed their love for each other.

She tried to head him off, saying that she wasn't ready for marriage, as she felt that as a woman, she could not accomplish the things she wanted to do in life if she were married. Rejected, Jones left the restaurant. The next morning, Prentiss showed up at the train station, unsure whether to see Jones off to war. Jones caught sight of her and called to her, and she turned to gaze at her love one last time before he rushed onto the train.

   In her youth, Vicky Prentiss, her sibling(s) and mother traveled with her father, a diplomat, to a number of countries. Her father would then speak to her in each country's respective language. As a result, she developed great skills in learning languages; By 1916, she spoke (in addition to her native English) fluent French, German, Italian, Hungarian, Greek, Swedish, Arabic and Welsh. When she met Indiana Jones, the two were impressed by how similar their upbringings had been.
