   The temple was entered from the top of the structure. To get into the temple one must remove the stone heads that keep sand inside an obelisk. If all the sand is emptied, the four towers of stone on the obelisk will come together and open the floor to the next part of the temple. Then there are retracting stairs a leaping distance apart from each other, and below is water with stone spikes.

   Jones and his friends were able to get far enough down the stairs before they retracted completely. Indiana Jones and his allies were lucky enough not to get impaled by the spikes when they landed in the water below, and discovered some of the remains of Orellana's men. Past the defensive mechanisms, they discovered storerooms containing artifacts from many ancient cultures from all over the world. Jones realized that the aliens were in fact archaeologists. Inside the storeroom, Oxley found a doorway leading to the aliens' chamber, and Jones used the skull to open the door.

   on the headless skeleton, she demanded to know everything. While the aliens proceeded to fill her head with knowledge, all thirteen skeletons became one interdimensional being. With the skull returned, Oxley's sanity was restored, and the Americans recognized the danger of their surroundings and fled. Spalko was consumed by the knowledge and her troops were sucked into a dimensional portal. McHale, distracted by looting the storehouse, was also pulled into the vortex. Escaping the collapsing temple through a different route, Jones, Ravenwood, Oxley and Williams eventually were pushed up by a column of water to a spot outside the city, on the edge of the crater, where they watched the temple collapse and city destroyed by the vortex, before the entire crater was flooded by the river waters outside it.
