   another soldier

   The knight explained to his visitors that only by drinking from the true Holy Grail would grant that person eternal life, while a false one would take it away. Faced with this dilemma, Donovan relied on Schneider choosing for him. She gave Donovan a
   bejeweled, golden chalice

   Toasting to his own longevity, Donovan drank from the Grail but, after a long pause, he gasped in pain, dropping the golden chalice to the ground. To his horror, Donovan found his hair rapidly growing out from his skull and his skin quickly wrinkling. He grabbed Schneider, his desperate questioning of what was happening turning to furious, undead roars of anger upon realizing Schneider had tricked him, Donovan would go on to have his eyeballs shrivel into nothing, his face grow crusty and his mouth wither away, leaving his rotten gums and teeth on full display in a matter of seconds, but Indiana Jones pushed what was left of the doomed Donovan away.
   As his bony arms still flailed in desperation,
   the skeletal Donovan fell against a wall where he shattered into dust. With a Nazi pin left lying amongst all that remained of him, the knight announced that Walter Donovan had chosen poorly.

   Walter Donovan was a ruthless, arrogant and greedy man though he was able to hide it under the mask of a warm, genial and understanding person who was concerned about other people.
   Though distinguished, Donovan was duplicitous.

  </p>
  <p key="f80b1039-9266-4d1c-9dde-31f2b2993817">
   An example of his ruthlessness was through desire for objects of great historical significance, like the
