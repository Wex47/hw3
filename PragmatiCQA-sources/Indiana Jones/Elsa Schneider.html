After their boat's engine was shot up, Indy jumped to another boat, and started attacking

   The two returned to their apartments to clean up. While Jones was showering, Schneider searched his room, leaving it a mess, then also trashed her own room, and pretended to draw a bath with the phonograph playing so Jones would not hear the ransacking. When Jones discovered that his room had been searched, he sought out Schneider, who acted surprised on seeing her room torn about. He revealed that he had the Grail Diary, sent to him by his father, and she became furious that he hadn't revealed his possession of it before. Indy turned the tense situation into an afternoon of passion.

   Later, Schneider drove with Jones to the Austrian border, while Brody was sent to
   Iskenderun

   butler
   who answered the door. Sneaking around the castle, they discovered a room likely to be holding Indy's father, and Jones left her in a side room. After Jones had rescued his father and started shooting the Nazis in the castle, the father and son returned to the side room, where SS Colonel

   In the castle's dining room, the Joneses learned that Donovan was also working for the Nazis. When Indiana and his father were tied up, Schneider told Donovan to keep both them alive in case they couldn't get Brody, who had made off with map pages from the Grail Diary. Minutes later, she gave Indy a long kiss, much to the annoyance of Henry. She received a telegram from Berlin, requesting her presence there, she took the diary with her, to show as a progress report on the quest for the Grail.

   with Adolf Hitler, where she was uncomfortable with the destruction of knowledge. As she was leaving, Indy, in the disguise of a Nazi officer, grabbed her throat and threatened her life until she returned the diary. After Indy departed, she alerted the Nazis, who began a manhunt for Indy and Henry.

   using the map from their captive, Marcus Brody. On the way, the convoy of Nazi and Hatay soldiers came under attack by Kazim and the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword. As Kazim's life ebbed away, he gave a final warning to Schneider and Donovan that the Grail would bring them death, which affected her greatly. While Indy attempted to rescue his father and Brody from Vogel's tank, Schneider and Donovan proceeded to the

Henry was shot by Donovan, much to Schneider's horror as she still had some lingering affection for the Joneses, forcing Indiana to pass the three trials in order to reach the Grail Chamber in order to save his father. After he passed through the trials, Schneider and Donovan followed into the final chamber, where the

   presented the challenge of choosing the one true Grail among many false grails. Donovan was unable to make a choice, so Schneider offered to choose for him. Inspecting the many cups, Schneider chose the most ornate golden chalice studded with jewels and presented it to Donovan, who drank from it, and began rapidly aging. Recognizing Schneider's treachery, he turned on her, but only terrified her as he withered away into death.

   After composing herself, Schneider and Indy began inspecting the grails, the former noting that the real one would not be made out of gold and the latter noting an old, wooden cup. This turned out to be the true Holy Grail and Indy used it to heal his father's bullet wound back at the entrance of the temple. After Henry had set it down, Schneider picked up the grail and, forgetting the warnings of the Grail Knight, insisted that she planned to share it with Indy. As Indy ordered for her not to move, Elsa found it too late to heed his warnings and stepped across the
   Great Seal
   at the temple's entrance. The entire structure began to quake. Elsa lost her footing, causing the grail to roll away from her grasp as she hit the ground. Elsa lunged forward to try to recover the chalice, but in doing so, she knocked it into the splitting floor. Elsa could not maintain her hold on the rising earth, and fell on to tilted ground, sliding towards the chasm. Indiana dove to grab her hands just in time.

   Elsa held on for her life, but before Indy could pull her up, she wrenched one of her hands free to reach the Grail after realizing it was right below her. Elsa's hand was just inches short of reaching the cup, and Indiana pleaded for her to save herself. Elsa ignored Indiana's warnings, greedily insisting she could reach it. All the while, the glove on her other hand was slipping off. Elsa continued to stretch her arm out, but before she could manage to touch the grail, her hand slipped from its glove. Elsa lost her life when Indiana was unable to catch her as she fell into the misty chasm below. After they escaped, Henry told Indy that Elsa didn't believe in the Grail, that she thought she had found a prize.

   Elsa was a very conflicted woman. She claimed that she didn't believe in the swastika and indeed was saddened at the destruction of knowledge. As an art historian, she was very devoted to the pursuit of knowledge and regarded books very highly; at the Nazi rally in Berlin, she wept at the sight of so many books being consigned to the flames. She was also quite ruthless, as demonstrated by her deliberately choosing a false Grail for Donovan, and seduced both Joneses to get closer to them and the Grail. She was capable of qualities like sympathy, sorrow and compassion – having reacted in horror when Donovan shot Henry Jones Sr. – but ultimately her lust for the material gain of the Grail corrupted her.
