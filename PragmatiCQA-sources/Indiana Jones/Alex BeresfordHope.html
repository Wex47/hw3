With von Hassell distracted by Jones' actions, Beresford-Hope grabbed his captor. Jones called out to him, trying to get him to jump to Jones' sled. A lightning bolt hit the ice ahead of the racing sleds, opening a large crack in the ice, and all the sleds fell into the darkness.

Upon viewing the star charts in the ceiling of the antechamber, Beresford-Hope commented that the Nazis had no way to reach the stars - a sentiment rejected by von Hassell, who remarked on Nazi progress in rocketry. Von Hassell drew his pistol on Beresford-Hope, ordering him to enter the tomb. Beresford-Hope related that his father, along with

   , had previously found the tomb, in a party of fifteen men -- and only three returned alive - and lost their sanity. Threatened with death, Beresford-Hope bravely refused to help von Hassell, and kept his father's promise to protect the Tomb from those seeking its power. Realizing that the young man would not change his mind, von Hassell slid out the blade in his sleeve and cut Beresford-Hope down. From his hiding place, Indiana Jones watched Alex Beresford-Hopes's death, and eventually avenged him by killing von Hassell and destroying the Tomb of the Gods, preventing others from finding its secrets.
