   . By the 20th century, six statues still existed, and were on display in museums around the world. Several of the pieces contained clues to the location of

   . In four days, Bey-Faisal and his henchmen managed to steal the Giraffe, Monkey, Rhino, and Tiger statues. Sensing an opportunity to secretly steal and pawn his museum's Crocodile statue,
   Ballantine Gruber
   planned a copycat crime to have the
   New York Museum of History
   robbed.
   Two thieves
   broke into his museum, grabbed the Crocodile and knocked out several of the guards, including Gruber.

   , who had only previously ever seen the Lion in Barcelona. While Brody estimated that each statue could be worth up to thirty thousand dollars, Jones surmised that something larger was at stake. Reviewing his books, Jones pointed out that the statues might help find the mystical invicible ruby of Emir Ali Bey, whose closest confidant was Wohat. Meanwhile, Bey-Faisal and his men broke into the
   Barcelona History Museum
   and stole the Lion statue.

   , and examined the crime scene, running into Gruber, who claimed to be interested in partnering up after all, to help recover his stolen piece. The pair were accosted by Ali Bey-Faisal and his two henchmen, and Jones learned that Bey-Faisal had been hired by Belloq. Jones tailed Bey-Faisal to a
   Barcelona hotel
   , where Bey-Faisal met with Belloq. Jones broke into Belloq's room and found the five mammal statues. Examining them up close in a maintenance closet, Jones discovered that the undersides of the statues, when pieced together, formed a map of southeastern

   Taking the five mammals, Jones traveled to Kenya, and outside of
   Mombasa
   , he found the ruins of
   Ali Bey's Palace
   . Reaching a door, Jones translated some of the inscription to learn that an arrangement of mammals would open the door. Finding five slots, he arranged the animals in hopes of the door opening. After sixteen arrangements, Jones found that the correct order was Giraffe, Lion, Monkey, Tiger, Rhino, and the door opened. Bey-Faisal and his men stepped out of the jungle, relieved that Jones had solved the puzzle for them, and revealed that Jones' theft of the statues from Belloq had been a set-up. Gruber rescued Jones from Bey-Faisal and the two fled into the dark ruins, where they eventually discovered a box carved by Wohat that contained the invincible ruby, which Gruber tried to take at gunpoint.
  </p>
  <p key="a702870a-4799-446f-94b3-ab3c58dcf52c">
   Jones had realized that Bey-Faisal hadn't been behind the Crocodile theft since they were only interested in the mammalian statues, though Gruber had claimed that Bey-Faisal's men were the same men that had robbed him in New York, and confronted Gruber about it. Gruber eventually admitted to the theft and the Crocodile's sale on the black market, before his demise by grabbing the ruby.

   The five mammal statues were likely destroyed when the palace collapsed after Gruber's vaporization.
