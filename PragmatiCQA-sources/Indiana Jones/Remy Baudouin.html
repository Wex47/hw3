   Remy and Indy arrived in London to enlist in the Belgian army. Celebrating their enlistment in the
   Café Belgique
   afterwards, Remy met the war widow
   Suzette
   . After getting rid of Indy—encouraging him to find his own war widow—Remy engaged in a flirtation with the mother of four. By the time he met Indy again at the train station where they were to be shipped out, he was married.

   . At this point, Remy was severely injured, and spent some weeks in an army field hospital before being sent back out, yet again to Verdun.  Marching into an attack in which he knew he would surely die, his life was spared at the last moment thanks to a desperate decision by Indy, who destroyed the orders that would send Remy and his unit to their deaths.

   Reunited in the trenches, Indy got himself and Remy a much needed break by arranging for a leave in Paris.
   During leave in Paris, Remy indulged himself with the local prostitutes. He emerged from a heady week of debauchery to find Indy arrested, prompting their superiors to send back to the front; however, Indy arranged through his contacts for a transfer to

   In October 1916, Remy had gotten used to following the talented, energetic, younger Indiana, so he reacted with much annoyance when Indy managed to get them totally lost on their way to Beligan forces at
   Lake Victoria
   . Meeting up with British troops, Remy ended up serving in the beachfront trenches in German East Africa, while Indy went on a mission with a band of old soldiers, the
   25th Frontiersman Battalion, Royal Fusiliers
   , to blow up a German artillery train. After completing that mission, the fusiliers decided to help 'escort' Indy and Remy back to Belgian forces, but were actually on a mission to capture German field marshal
   Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck
   . In their plan, they masqueraded as European settlers, and Remy was forced to dress as a woman. The disguises failed and the entire force was captured by von Lettow-Vorbeck. After a jailbreak, Remy and Indy managed to capture von Lettow-Vorbeck and escape in a hot air observation balloon. After Indy shot down their balloon, Remy and Indy escorted their prisoner on foot, using him to also provide local survival knowledge. Eventually, German agents recovered von Lettow-Vorbeck but allowed Remy and Indy to escape, and the duo finally made it to their unit on Lake Victoria.

   , they were denied troops by their French allies to make the return trip. At this point in January 1917, with only twelve men, and no hope of making it back to Lake Victoria, Remy gave into despair and hopelessness. Indy too was unhappy but as the highest ranking remaining officer resolved to return. Their friendship was severely tested, with Remy delivering a right hook to his superior officer's jaw after Indy tried to pull rank on him.

Jones realized the foolhardiness of the mission and apologized to his bed-ridden friend. Schweitzer turned Indy around, back into being a humanitarian rather than an officer, but was tragically evicted from from his hospital by the French authorities who couldn't see past his nationality. As Indy and Remy watched, Schweitzer's patients stumbled out of the wards, and back into the jungle to die while Schweitzer and his wife were arrested and sent back to Port-Gentil to be deported. With their guns no longer needed at Tabora, Indy and Remy received orders in Port-Gentil to escort the heavy weapons back to Europe. They bid farewell to the Schweitzers, and Remy convinced a

   Remy and Indy, after Schweitzer's lessons, decided to do all they could to end the war by enlisting in the Belgian secret service. Finding this unsatisfactory they managed to transfer themselves to the far more efficient French secret service. Because he had experience as a cook, Remy was assigned to his hometown of
