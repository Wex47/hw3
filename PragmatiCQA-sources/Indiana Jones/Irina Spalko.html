   Irina Spalko was born on
   May 26
   ,
   1921
   in
   Kazan
   .
   She was raised in a small mountain village in the eastern regions of the
   Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic
   . When her apparent psychic powers began to manifest themselves, the superstitious villagers shunned her, called her a witch, and worse. Her family was ostracized. Left to herself, she gradually became consumed by a personal quest that would fuel her from then to the last day of her life. Then, as she grew older and more curious, her dissecting of small animals - her innocent attempt to understand life and biology - caused even
   her own mother
   to fear her. As soon as she was old enough, she fled the village and mountains altogether, certain that the answers she sought could only be found in the wider world.

   Eventually Spalko obtained a doctorate and joined the Soviet secret police. This security, intelligence and counterintelligence organization underwent multiple name changes since its inception in
   1917
   and - depending on the time she joined - would have been known by Spalko as the NKVD, the NKGB, the MGB and the MVD - and would become, in
   1954

   generally took more seriously than the West. In one such experiment, a mother rabbit’s newborn litter was placed aboard a submarine, which was then submerged. The mother remained onshore, her EEG readings carefully monitored, while beneath the surface of the water, inside the submarine, the young rabbits were killed one by one. As each one was slain, the mother's readings registered a reaction at the exact instant of each death. The experiment verified what Spalko already instinctively knew: that there was a tangible psychic link between living beings.

  <p key="474892a7-205e-4c7d-a677-b1fb685e1628">
   In
   1957
   , Irina Spalko became interested in the legends surrounding the lost kingdom of Akator and, especially, the mysterious Crystal Skull. She interpreted the stories as meaning that if she were to return the Skull to the Temple of the Gods, she would be rewarded with all the power and knowledge of the universe. Spalko also saw this as the opportunity she had been waiting for; a chance to discover the meaning behind her strange gifts.
  </p>
  <p key="bead8798-0f24-49f6-b10b-2f6ad55fe870">
   As it were, a few years prior two unearthly spacecraft had crashed in Russia, the beings inside killed from the impact. These creatures shared a very peculiar trait: skeletons made of a magnetic, psychically-supercharged crystal, with abnormally long skulls and massive eye sockets. Both were examined and given autopsies by Soviet scientists, and Spalko was a member of the team that studied the bodies.

  <p key="ce761716-8ce9-4bf1-999a-bd07cdf9edbe">
   Somehow, she learned that a third craft had also crashed onto Earth, but in Roswell, New Mexico, USA. She knew that this third traveler was the key to understanding these beings. First, she sent Colonel

   convoy arrived at the warehouse, Jones and Mac were hauled out. Spalko delayed showing herself, allowing Dovchenko to question Jones first; when the adventurer responded with an insult, the annoyed Colonel backhanded the man. He was about to toss another blow, when Irina stepped out of her vehicle, dramatically ordering her second-in-command to halt.
  </p>
  <p key="dffa5c6a-b355-445f-b4e1-b67da2f0b1f9">
   Walking up to Jones, she casually bantered with him, and attempted to get answers from the man by calmly outlining her demands. Amused at Jones sarcastic attitude, she then tried to break into the Professor’s mind, to forcefully take the information she sought. She failed after much concentration, but was very impressed at his iron will. Dryly remarking about the expression “the old-fashioned way,” she had the warehouse doors open.
  </p>
  <p key="6561942b-94bc-4c74-9d97-b523129b24f0">
   Inside, the Colonel-Doctor gave Jones a choice: to either help them locate the crate they were after, or they would kill him and his friend McHale. Falling for the Soviet's bluff, Indiana agreed, and demanded gunpowder. Spalko was confused at this, and grew impatient with Jones' ambiguous actions. Using the metal in the air to find the crate, the group was able to remove the wooden box and open the metal container within. Spalko approached the 'coffin', and her sword instantly sprang up, locking with the magnetic pull of the remains within the box.
  </p>
  <p key="bd73d175-32a7-406a-b505-aa7ba2697bdf">
   Handing her scabbard to one of her men before personally examining the mutilated corpse, Irina was about to unwrap the mummy within when Jones attempted a desperate hostage situation, pointing a gun at Spalko and threatening to kill her if her forces did not stand down. With amusement, she watched as McHale revealed his true allegiances, but was surprised when Jones created a diversion with his discarded weapon to escape into the sea of endless crates.
  </p>
  <p key="3d50ea49-8504-4e57-ba9f-b7b2e414d543">
   Ordering her men after Jones, Spalko commandeered a vehicle, carrying the valuable crate, to escape the hangar, most likely because she predicted Indiana would try to recapture the metal box. Jones was able to take over an escorting car, and began ramming Spalko's bumper. The American leaped onto her car into the seat beside her, and they briefly tangled as the car sped toward a wall of crates. Spalko was able to abandon ship before the vehicle impacted, safely landing in a pile of hay from smashed crates.
  </p>
  <p key="2ec05c3e-e3a9-4fb3-924d-46096ecacb76">
   As Jones fled with Dovchenko in pursuit, she had McHale and a few of her men follow the two, who then fell through a skylight and into the laboratory beneath. During Jones and Dovchenko's struggle, they accidentally activated a prototype rocket sled that incinerated her backup group, with only McHale ducking for cover. She soon pulled up in a car, letting Mac inside, and applauded the man for his actions.
  </p>
  <p key="8265926b-0fc0-4d4c-b40f-d0fe96cd9370">
   Spalko and her team then fled from the installation, as the American military arrived to investigate the break-in. She was aware that a nuclear detonation test was to take place that morning, and did not tell this to the men she had chasing Jones, who had wandered across the
   fake demolition town
   full of mannequins. The bomb detonated minutes later, and Spalko believed this to be the end of her short-but-memorable relationship with Indiana Jones.
  </p>
  <p key="759223fe-8138-476d-a94e-68fbbe90099e">
   As it turned out, Jones, through sheer luck and ingenuity, had survived by locking himself within a
   lead-lined fridge
   , tossed many miles into the air and landing safely back to earth, saved by the lead that shielded the radiation while in the other hand, Spalko's men were vaporized. Indiana was still out there, and now Spalko’s intentions were exposed to the
   FBI
   .

  <p key="516dc41a-0623-4f76-b9fd-8c776fdb6df6">
   The KGB eventually got wind of Jones' survival and sent agents to chase him through the

   to be captured and held prisoner. The intent of this was to lure Jones to Nazca in search of his two friends, so that Spalko could recapture the troublesome American. As part of this, she did nothing when Ravenwood secretly sent a letter to her son, Mutt Williams, urging the boy to seek out Jones' help. This would allow her spies in America to capture not just Jones but also the boy and a valuable piece of information included in the note: information vital to Spalko's goal.

   Spalko and her soldiers pursued the escaping Jones, Williams, Ravenwood, and Oxley. Standing on two vehicles moving side-by-side through the jungle, Spalko drew her notorious rapier and dueled with Mutt Williams, who had had some earlier fencing lessons at prep school. Eventually both vehicles crashed and at least two of of Spalko's thugs (

   , but she used a liana to get safe and thus didn't succumb to that fate. To avoid certain death, Ravenwood then drove her vehicle into the Sono River where she, Williams, Jones, Oxley, and George McHale survived three waterfalls, arriving by water to the Temple of Akator.

    everything

   , and the the thirteen skeletons started firing knowledge out of their skulls into her eyes. The Temple started to collapse, opening a portal in the ceiling to another dimension which pulled in what was left of Spalko's forces and Mac. Jones' band managed to escape from the Temple while the crystal skeletons merged together to form an individual living entity right before Spalko, who fruitlessly pleaded for the experience to end.

   In her final moments, Spalko painfully felt how her skull transformed into quartz as the interdimensional beings granted her request for know all but the very last thing she ever perceived was a terrifying glimpse at unidentified things that were beyond her comprehension.
   The continuous stream of knowledge overwhelmed her and, fire erupting from her eye sockets, she disintegrated, leaving her boots behind. Her remains were then sucked into the portal which revealed itself to be part of an
   enormous flying saucer

Spalko would also wear a large set of sunglasses, enhancing her intimidating appearance. She displayed a very determined devotion to her job and country, and was seemingly a genuine patriot. Spalko wore black leather boots and occasionally gloves. She was usually dressed in a gray military uniform, perhaps too proud to display her allegiance to the

   . Her weapon of choice was a rapier. Spalko was an infamous leader, with a cruel disregard for innocent casualties and harboring a secret, selfish motivation. However, she did all this in the name of her country, and not out of pure maliciousness. As a soldier, she did only what was needed to complete the mission at hand.

She treated the adventurer as an equal, and it is quite possible that, had they not been on opposite sides of the moral and political board, they would have made a fine team. She even allowed Indiana to know of her ultimate plan, a rather foolish thing to share with an enemy. Spalko was, however, jealous of the fact that the
