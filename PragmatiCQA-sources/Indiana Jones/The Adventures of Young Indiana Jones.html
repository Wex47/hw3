  <p key="fb2b2e48-f8ca-4887-8241-36774eb4a453">
   In addition to the removal of the bookend segments, some chapters included new footage to help connect the separated storylines of the two episodes being edited into one story. While much of this bridging material had been filmed at the time of the episode's filming, some additional scenes were filmed after the show had aired. In some of the new additional scenes that were shot in 1996 with Corey Carrier, digital techniques were used to shrink Corey to make him appear younger.

   Other smaller changes were made. In some instances, characters were re-dubbed–sometimes with completely new voice actors. Rather than fading quickly to the end credits, most of the chapters slowly transition from the series' color footage to a version of the footage rendered to look like old black and white film reels. The credits themselves were also changed in many instances. The Lucasfilm logo at the end of each episode was replaced with the then-most recent Lucasfilm logo at the beginning.

  <p key="e3217c02-0242-4ccc-b7fb-fe8c3e9e7168">
   As is the case with many TV series, the "bumpers" were also removed; at commercial breaks, either Corey Carrier, Sean Patrick Flanery, or George Hall would announce over an image of the opening credits that the series would be right back. Additionally, several previews for episodes were made, with each having one of the three previously mentioned actors saying that the episode being previewed was coming up next.
