   Grail diary

   Vogel and a
   Gestapo
   agent
   halted the takeoff of a
   zeppelin
   , believing that the fugitives might be trying to escape on it. Both Joneses were on board and Vogel discovered the elder one reading a newspaper upside down and smugly greeted him in German only to be asked for a ticket by a steward. After said steward stayed behind him, Vogel turned to ask him what he wanted and quickly realised that this steward was Indiana Jones in disguise. Before the startled officer could react, Indy punched him across the face and threw him out the window into a large pile of suitcases below. Upon noticing the startled passengers, Indy excused his actions by saying that the colonel did not have a ticket, prompting them to immediately start brandishing their own tickets in panic to avoid being thrown out the window themselves. As the zeppelin took off, Vogel declared that they had not seen the last of him.

   reached the tank to rescue the prisoners, following a failed attempt by Vogel to shoot him with the tank's guns,
   three

   soldiers
   reinforced Vogel, but Jones managed to take out them with a single bullet. Vogel took the opportunity to strangle Indy with a chain with the help of
   another soldier
   . However, after giving his pistol to his father, Indy freed himself and managed to kill Vogel's aide. Due to the ensuing explosion of one of the Nazi trucks at his father's hand, Jones caught up on one of the side guns at the mercy of Vogel, who hit at him with a shovel and ordered the
   tank's driver
   to continue on in order to crush the archaeologist against a stone wall.

   Unfortunately for Vogel, the efforts of the elder Jones and Brody caused the death of the driver, pulling the tank away from the wall towards a nearby cliff. Indiana took this opportunity to knock out Vogel, but just when Jones' companions emerged from the tank's hatch, Vogel reappeared with the shovel, causing Jones to accidentally knock Brody off the tank and Vogel sent Jones Sr into the tank's treads, but

   appeared just in time to save the older Jones. Now just the two of them, Indy pinned Vogel's left arm behind his back and hammered his face into the tank's turret repeatedly before the tank carried them both over the precipice. While Jones managed to get away in time, Vogel clutched onto the back of the tank turret, screaming as he fell into the canyon, and was killed when the tank landed and rolled over him several times on the sharp rocks below.

   A high-ranking
   Schutzstaffel
   (SS) officer, Vogel was a ruthless and brutal person, sometimes with violent tendencies.
   Sadistic and ruthless, Vogel would had stopped at nothing for the Führer's prize.
   However, Vogel cared more about his orders than for the older Jones'
   Grail Diary
   or the

   Immediately, upon realizing the secrets hidden by the
   Grail Diary
   that his allies could have possibly imagined, Vogel turned his evil intentions to capturing and interrogating the two Joneses.
   He carried a swagger stick to note his authority and used a
   Luger P08
   pistol when in combat, also utilizing anything he could fight with that was close to hand, such as a shovel, in the fight that led to his death.

    Elsa Schneider

   addresses Vogel as "Herr Oberst". Oberst is actually a rank in the
   Wehrmacht
   , and Vogel was a member of the SS, which had its own system of ranks. Vogel would have been properly addressed as "Herr Standartenführer". This is possibly confusion on the screenwriters' part, perhaps because both the Army rank of Oberst and the SS rank of Standartenführer represent the rank of Colonel. It could also be interpreted as an error on the part of Elsa herself. Another answer to this might be the possibility that Colonel Vogel was both an SS and an Orpo man thus allowing him to have both the title of Standartenführer and Oberst.
