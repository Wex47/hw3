   By the 20th century, the
   Chachapoyans
   were long gone from the world,
   but their lineage survived in successor peoples such as the Hovitos,
   and the group from whom
   Xomec
   was a descendant.
   Both were sometimes referred to as Chachapoyans themselves.

   In
   1893
   ,
   Bandelier
   mapped the region, following in the footsteps of
   Juan Crisostomo Nieto
   's expedition
   fifty years earlier
   , and marked the presence of a "head hunter village".
   If this was a Hovitos village, he may not have been aware that their settlements were impermanent, shifting location between fresh water sources on an almost annual basis to evade rival tribes and take advantage of new hunting grounds.
  </p>
  <p key="789fab7a-63e5-49d8-ae2e-33d67c716432">
   A Hovitos village was a singular, wheel-shaped structure built from wood and possessed just one entrance/exit. A thatched roof covered the village with the exception of the central courtyard holding several stone-lined fire pits for cooking. The Hovitos slept in hammocks strung up between the support poles of the roof which were protected by a wooden stockade that circled the perimeter.
  </p>
  <p key="aea09a1a-9693-4fef-a8dd-f32417ad3518">
   Despite their seminomadic nature, the tribe was fiercely territorial, lethally so in the case of intrusion on land that they considered sacred such as the Chachapoyan Temple valley where their warriors' weekslong manhood rituals took place. War against other Hovitos villages was infrequent and usually provoked by other factors such as the accidental death of a chieftain, overhunting in the area or clashes with other hunting parties over game.
  </p>
  <p key="9cfd9086-e5d6-427d-b889-9f17f84f0500">
   The secluded Hovitos had had contact with Westerners in their past. Missionaries brought with them metal pots and utensils, while the occasional explorer had exchanged "shiny trinkets" in exchange for Hovitos guides to the rainforest but the Hovitos were wary of technology that they couldn't comprehend like firearms and electricals. At some point they came to usually expect gifts in return for their hospitality. However, village temperament was often dependent on their situation at the time. A flourishing village may have celebrated visitors with feasting but in times of war or when experiencing a famine, the Hovitos would treat outsiders as warmongerers or food thieves.

  <p key="eea661f4-8863-4b64-99de-842ad4e26c55">
   Over the following years, however, Belloq became more successful at getting what he wanted and had taken to using self-professed "cunning methods" to acquire artifacts.

   , a competitor with whom Belloq had some association,
   organized an expedition into Peru.

   , a pair of local thieves to steal the map to the temple from one of Forrestal's campsites. His scheme didn't go as planned: the thieves did the job but simply kept the map for themselves. Barranca informed the Frenchman that the map was incomplete and thus functionally useless for finding more treasure. Despite the setback, Belloq was able to work out the general area that Forrestal was looking for the temple by calculating where Barranca and Satipo had gone hunting for the map.
  </p>
  <p key="94d54bb1-40f0-432e-b89d-2d6eb4266e9b">
   Hovitos witnessed Forrestal's discovery of the Chachapoyan Temple for himself but it was the structure's booby traps that claimed his life. Although he would only learn of Forrestal's fate later on,
   Belloq knew that the interior was protected and that he'd need someone to brave its dangers once he could pinpoint the temple's location.

  </p>
  <p key="f051c1db-0460-4582-9044-1ea102d8fcdc">
   As Jones played his part, Belloq kept up his machinations. When Jones retrieved the rest of Forrestal's map, Belloq anonymously tipped off Barranca and Satipo, and the thieves attached themselves to Jones as guides into the temple valley.
  </p>
  <p key="2c255c89-b775-4cfc-857a-045a71609b02">
   Belloq then returned to his Hovitos friends with grave news: outsiders were trying to violate the sacred grounds of their ancestors. With that, the Hovitos finally led Belloq into the valley.
  </p>
  <p key="dae5b04f-6922-4ca6-8385-913f7fd2fef0">
   If the Hovitos had intended for Belloq to go no further, it no longer mattered. The sound of
   a plane
   overhead indicated that Indiana Jones had arrived and a gunshot about an hour later led the group towards the Temple of the Chachapoyan Warriors. Along the way, they encountered Barranca fleeing from the opposite direction who told the Hovitos where the rest of his party was only for the tribe to kill him for his incursion onto their land.
  </p>
  <p key="940e4e06-7614-4672-8682-d43c4b69c2c9">
   Jones and Satipo were already inside the temple when Belloq and the Hovitos arrived. Although Satipo would meet the same end as Forrestal, Jones successfully claimed the Chachapoyan Fertility Idol and evaded a giant rolling boulder that was released to prevent his escape. He landed at the feet of Belloq and the Hovitos waiting outside and the dart-riddled body of Barranca was dumped in front of him. The Frenchman reclaimed the idol from Jones then raised it aloft to the Hovitos who dropped to their knees in reverence of the golden goddess which provided Jones the opportunity to escape. The Hovitos gave chase but Jones made his getaway in
