   While the "war" was not a series of active military battles, it was marked by several actual wars of proxy: the Korean War (in which a stalemate between the Communist northern forces and the American-allied southern forces led to the division of Korea in the early 1950s), the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 70s; as well as several confrontations that could have escalated into warfare, including the blockade of West

   The United States and Soviet Union never went directly into military battle against each other, but competed in the development of their nuclear arsenals, the exploration of space, and attempts to stop the spread of competing ideologies in the developing world (Africa, Latin America, Asia).

   In the United States in the 1950s, the fear of the Soviets and their communist ideology led to a revival of anti-communism in the United States, with Congress investigating supposed Un-American activities, the blacklisting of many in the entertainment and academic communities who had been accused of communist sympathies, and the
   FBI
   keeping files on many of its prominent citizens for potential communist connections. The events that occurred during this time period have been labeled McCarthyism, primarily due to the involvement of Wisconsin Senator
   Joseph McCarthy
   in these "witchhunts", while the fear of Communists infiltrating American institutions resulted in the
   Red Scare
   .
