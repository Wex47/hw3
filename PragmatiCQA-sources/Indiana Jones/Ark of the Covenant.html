   Over two decades later, in
   1957
   , Jones was taken to the warehouse when captured by
   Soviets
   looking for
   a different crate
   . The box containing the Ark was broken during the subsequent action brought about from his escape attempt.
   Jones saw enough of the relic to recognize it, and realized that Hangar 51 had become the Ark's fate but continued with his getaway.
   The archaeologist made a note in his journal that he had learned of the Ark's whereabouts and mused on the possibility of making a return trip as well as wondering what else could be in storage there.

   . For example, Brody's statement that "the Bible speaks of the Ark leveling mountains and laying waste to entire regions" is only partially accurate (when it was captured by the Philistines it "laid waste" to their "region" via bubonic plague), though the Bible does state the Ark had supernatural powers. The Ark is reputed to have the second set of the Ten Commandments written in it, which are whole, not the first broken pair. Although a Rabbinic tradition states that Moses also put the broken fragments of the first tablets of the Law into the Ark.

  <p key="0d746d99-12a2-4c38-a2dd-69ceac83bf83">
   The picture in which Jones and Brody show Musgrove and Eaton the Ark's destructive power might be another version of the Battle of Jericho.  It is written in the Book of Joshua, a biblical story of how Israel had conquered Canaan, that for six days the Israelites had marched around the walls of Jericho once every day with their priests carrying the Ark, after which on the seventh day they marched around seven times.
  </p>
  <p key="7ef898e3-f562-46bc-b4a6-89ac201b745b">
   The punishment of death upon Belloq and the Nazis for disturbing the Ark is inspired by a Bible reference in 1 Samuel 6:19 when seventy people of Beth-Shemesh were struck down because they looked into the Ark.
  </p>
  <p key="b1d37aaf-f117-4647-9c2b-a1b22a70f424">
   Also, the Bible relates a command by King Josiah of Judah in 2 Chronicles 35:3 for the Levites to "Put the sacred ark in the temple that Solomon built". Since King Josiah reigned from 640 - 609 BC, and the Bible mentions the Ark as being present in Jerusalem during his reign over three hundred years after Shishak's invasion, the Tanis theory is untenable.
  </p>
  <p key="4a4b928a-c2c2-45f2-b745-994e1603035c">
   The fate of the actual Ark, if the artifact does exist, continues to elude archaeologists. The city of Tanis is one of many locations where it is theorized the Ark may lie, although the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Ethiopia claims to have the true Ark safely kept in the Chapel of the Tablet. The Ark's guardian, and only he, is allowed to see it. Catholics also believe that Mary, the Mother of Jesus, is the new Ark of the Covenant due to similarities between her and the actual Ark.
