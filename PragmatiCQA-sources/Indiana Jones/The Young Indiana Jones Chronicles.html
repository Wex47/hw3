   The series was designed as an educational program for children and teenagers, spotlighting historical figures and important events of the early 20th century, using the concept of a prequel to the films as a draw. Most episodes feature a standard formula of an elderly Indiana Jones (played by

Carrier also was able to do some of his own stunts. Carrier and co-star Flanery spent little time together during production, as they were often shooting episodes simultaneously around the world.

    Harrison Ford was first offered the role of the older Indiana Jones, but turned it down because he felt television had nothing to offer his career.
    Hall was eventually cast due to his acting ability, and was required to wear makeup for the role.
    His scenes were shot at Wilmington, North Carolina,
    and are set in the present day (1992/1993). Refering to the character, Hall remarked "He's heroic in the sense that he's past the age of caring whether people appreciate what he's saying or not. He's old enough to know that truisms are truisms and should be believed because they are true. He's a good storyteller and he makes people want to listen to him and learn from listening to him. And then they go off and learn something else and continue the process of learning."

   According to the series' director of research
   Deborah Fine
   , the crew originally developed a timeline extending from 1908 to 1922 of all major events and people of the time period.
   Each episode was outlined before writing began, and included the location and date the story would take place, as well as the historical persons, major characters, and themes involved.
   After all of the writers were hired, they met at Lucas'
   Skywalker Ranch
   , where they lived and worked together while writing the scripts. They worked on one story per day, with each writer being assigned specific episodes.

   After the series' cancellation, Lucas claimed to have had "70 hours worth of scripts", of which "32 hours" were completed.
   There were plans for later episodes to include characters appearing and referenced in the feature films; the third season would have introduced Indy to

   Lucas intended to produce episodes leading up to a 24-year-old Jones, but the series was cancelled with the character at age 21.

   Lucas envisioned each episode as being "like a feature film for television". As a result, directors were hired who had mostly backgrounds in feature films, and each director was hired to fit the script in question.
   A wide variety of filmmakers were involved with the writing and directing for many episodes. On May 13, 1991, shooting began in Almeria, Spain, the same location used for the tank chase in

   The show was shot across over 25 countries for over 150 weeks. Partly to offset the cost of the extensive location shooting, the series was shot on
   16mm film
   , rather than
   35
   . Each episode cost about $1.5 million and the filming with Young Indy usually took around 3 weeks. Each production was looked at as one film, and the production's episodes were produced nonlinearly.
   Series one shot from March 1991—March 1992, while the second series began two months later and wrapped in April 1993.

   . While the original television broadcast versions skipped around chronologically in the character's life—alternating stories between Indy as a child and Indy as a teenager—the chapter versions present Indy's life in chronological order. The chapters correspond to two one-hour TV episodes, combined together, with the George Hall bookend segments removed. In order to connect some episodes, Lucas shot a large amount of bridging footage, while he also expanded some episodes with new footage. In 1998 and 1999, the Fox Family Channel (now ABC Family Channel) rebroadcast the four TV movies that it shown earlier as The Family Channel.

   called the pilot "clunky",
   felt that the show's educational elements were too obvious and forced, and felt that the show relied too heavily on the audience's prior knowledge.
   The National Coalition on Television Violence named the series the most violent television series of 1993,
   with an average of 60 acts of violence per episode.
   The series has been criticized for its purposefully inconsistent tone and style, and the fact that two actors play Young Indy.
