   Darabont felt very disappointed when Lucas rejected his script completely. In an interview with MTV, Darabont said that this rejection represented the loss of a entire year of his work.
   According to Darabont, this decision was more shocking because Spielberg had read the same script before Lucas and had said that it was "the best script he'd read since

  </p>
  <p key="304f2b9b-f9c8-4685-9ec5-d0dcefae47b9">
   Prior to the film's release, Darabont stated that he kept "hearing from people who are near the production and they keep saying, 'You know, they're using more of your ideas here than you may have thought.'", though he admitted not to have had a hand in the creation of

   script was the newsworthy WikiLeaks (wikileaks.org). When questioned about it in 2010, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange declared that Darabont wanted to make the script public after fans had expressed unhappiness with

   and had tried to post it online. Darabont "was involved in a creativity dispute" at the time and "his I.S.P. then received a legal threat to have [the script] removed", something that Assange considered akin to the censorship WikiLeaks was created to circunvent. In consequence, WikiLeaks released the script after "someone" gave it to them.
