   , translated as "Bright Path";
   May 28, 1888 - March 28, 1953)
   was an American athlete of mixed ancestry (Native American and Caucasian). Considered one of the most versatile athletes of modern sports, he won Olympic gold medals for the 1912
   pentathlon
   and decathlon, played American football (collegiate and professional), and also played professional baseball and basketball. He

   Of Native American and European American ancestry, Thorpe grew up in the Sac and Fox nation in Oklahoma. He played as part of several All-American Indian teams throughout his career, and "barnstormed" as a professional basketball player with a team composed entirely of American Indians.

  <p key="f59bd034-57ba-4eee-af90-88482d1f196e">
   He played professional sports until age 41, the end of his sports career coinciding with the start of the Great Depression.  Thorpe struggled to earn a living after that, working several odd jobs. Thorpe suffered from alcoholism, and lived his last years in failing health and poverty.

   Information about Thorpe's birth, name and ethnic background varies widely.
   He was born in Indian Territory, but no birth certificate has been found. Thorpe was generally considered born on May 28, 1888,
   near the town of Prague, Oklahoma.
   He was baptized "Jacobus Franciscus Thorpe" in the Catholic Church.
  </p>
  <p key="68987e3e-5951-40c9-976d-a1deb43b37f3">
   Thorpe's parents were both of mixed-race ancestry. His father, Hiram Thorpe, had an Irish father and a Sac and Fox Indian mother. His mother, Charlotte Vieux, had a French father and a Potawatomi mother, a descendant of Chief Louis Vieux. He was raised as a Sac and Fox, and his native name,
   <i key="3d1ab288-1cab-4011-b8c2-8d54ae61f7be">
    Wa-Tho-Huk
   </i>
   , translated as "path lit by great flash of lightning" or, more simply, "Bright Path".
   As was the custom for Sac and Fox, he was named for something occurring around the time of his birth, in this case the light brightening the path to the cabin where he was born. Thorpe's parents were both Roman Catholic, a faith which Thorpe observed throughout his adult life.
  </p>
  <p key="26600ccd-7b85-4448-a3c6-a387f52ff3a6">
   Thorpe attended the Sac and Fox Indian Agency school in Stroud, Oklahoma, with his twin brother Charlie.  Charlie helped him through school, but died of pneumonia when they were nine years old.
   He ran away from school several times. His father then sent him to the Haskell Institute, an "Indian" boarding school in Lawrence, Kansas, so that he would not run away again.
   When his mother died of childbirth complications two years later,
   he became depressed. After several arguments with his father, he left home to work on a horse ranch.

   Thorpe "ran around past and through them not once, but twice".

   The decathlon was a relatively new event in modern athletics, although it had been part of American track meets since the 1880s and a version had been featured on the program of the
   1904 St. Louis Olympics

   His schedule in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he competed in the long jump and high jump. The first competition was the pentathlon. He won four of the five events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he placed fourth, and also took seventh place in the long jump. Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found some discarded ones in a rubbish bin and won his medals wearing them.
   He is shown in the 1912 photo wearing two different shoes and extra socks because one shoe was too big.

   Although Thorpe had played for money, the AAU and IOC did not follow the rules for disqualification. The rulebook for the 1912 Olympics stated that protests had to be made "within" 30 days from the closing ceremonies of the Games.
   The first newspaper reports did not appear until January 1913, about six months after the Stockholm Games had concluded.
   There is also some evidence that Thorpe's amateur status had been questioned long before the Olympics, but the AAU had ignored the issue until being confronted with it in 1913.

   Thorpe, whose parents were both half Caucasian, was raised as an American Indian. His accomplishments occurred during a period of heavy racial inequality in the United States. It has often been suggested that his medals were stripped because of his ethnicity.
   While it is difficult to prove this, the public comment at the time largely reflected this view.
   At the time Thorpe won his gold medals, not all Native Americans were recognized as U.S. citizens. (The U.S. government had wanted them to make concessions to adopt European-American ways to receive such recognition.) Citizenship was not granted to all American Indians until 1924.

   A photograph of Thorpe and the 1911 football team emphasized racial differences among the competing athletes. The inscription on the most important game ball of that season reads, "1911, Indians 18, Harvard 15."
   Additionally, the school and journalists often categorized sporting competitions as conflicts of Indians against whites; newspaper headings such as "Indians Scalp Army 27–6" or "Jim Thorpe on Rampage" made stereotypical journalistic play of the Indian background of Carlisle's football team.

   . Armed with this support and evidence from 1912 proving that Thorpe's disqualification had occurred after the 30-day time period allowed by Olympics rules, they succeeded in making the case to the IOC. In October 1982, the IOC Executive Committee approved Thorpe's reinstatement.
   In an unusual ruling, they declared that Thorpe was co-champion with Bie and Wieslander, although both of these athletes had always said they considered Thorpe to be the only champion. In a ceremony on January 18, 1983, the IOC presented two of Thorpe's children, Gale and Bill, with commemorative medals.
   Thorpe's original medals had been held in museums, but they had been stolen and have never been recovered.
