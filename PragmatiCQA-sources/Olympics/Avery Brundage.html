    Avery Brundage
   </b>
   (September 28, 1887 – May 8, 1975) was the fifth president of the
   International Olympic Committee
   (IOC), serving from 1952 to 1972.  The only American to attain that position, Brundage is remembered as a zealous advocate of amateurism, and for his involvement with the 1936 and 1972 Summer Olympics, both held in Germany.
  </p>
  <p key="b9e6dd16-b5ed-4e0a-8dba-fa2a52b59cc9">
   Brundage was born in Detroit in 1887 to a working-class family; when he was five years old, his father moved his family to Chicago and subsequently abandoned his wife and children.  Raised mostly by relatives, he attended the University of Illinois to study engineering and became a track star. In 1912, he competed in

   , contesting the
   pentathlon
   and decathlon, but did not win any medals; both events were won by

   . He won national championships in track three times between 1914 and 1918, and founded his own construction business. He earned his wealth from this company and from investments, and never accepted pay for his sports involvement.
  </p>
  <p key="1370edd3-eb30-4125-bcfa-8ad2b5b47607">
   Following his retirement from athletics, Brundage became a sports administrator, rising rapidly through the ranks in United States sports groups.  As leader of America's Olympic organizations, he fought zealously against a boycott of the

   </a>
   , which had been awarded to Germany before the rise of its Nazi government and its subsequent, escalating persecution of Jews.  Although Brundage was successful in getting a team to the Games in Berlin, its participation was controversial, and has remained so.  Brundage was elected to the IOC that year, and quickly became a major figure in the Olympic movement.  He was elected IOC president in 1952.
  </p>
  <p key="fd5a0140-a977-4642-8963-236f3dcab3d3">
   As president, Brundage fought strongly for amateurism and against commercialization of the Olympic Games, even as these stands came to be seen as incongruous with the realities of modern sports.  His final Olympics as president,
   at Munich in 1972
   , was marked by controversy: at the memorial service following the murder of 11 Israeli athletes by terrorists, Brundage decried the politicization of sports and, refusing to cancel the remainder of the Olympics, declared "the Games must go on".  Although Brundage's statement was applauded by those in attendance, his decision to continue the Games has since been harshly criticized, and his actions in 1936 and 1972 seen as evidence of anti-Semitism. In retirement, Brundage married a German princess; he died in 1975.

   Avery Brundage was born in Detroit, Michigan, on September 28, 1887, the son of Charles and Minnie (Lloyd) Brundage. Charles Brundage was a stonecutter; the Brundages moved to Chicago when Avery was five, and Charles Brundage soon thereafter abandoned his family.  Avery and his younger brother, Chester, were mostly raised by aunts and uncles.  At age 13, in 1901, Brundage finished first in an essay competition, winning a trip to President William McKinley's second inauguration.  Avery attended Sherwood Public School and then R. T. Crane Manual Training School, both in Chicago.  Crane Tech was a journey of 7 miles (11 km) by public transportation, which he undertook only after completing a newspaper delivery route.  Even though the school had no athletic facilities, Brundage made his own equipment (including a shot and a hammer to throw) in the school's workshop and by his final year was written of in the newspapers as a schoolboy track star. According to sportswriter William Oscar Johnson in a 1980 article in
   <i key="f2d49df1-4481-4cc0-8f00-3d01f6226196">
    Sports Illustrated
   </i>
   , Brundage was "the kind of man whom Horatio Alger had canonized—the American urchin, tattered and deprived, who rose to thrive in the company of kings and millionaires".
  </p>
  <p key="3435f704-b5a5-4711-a8aa-24ae1f406830">
   After graduation from Crane Tech in 1905, Brundage enrolled at the University of Illinois, where he undertook an arduous schedule of civil engineering courses.  He received an honors degree in 1909. He wrote for various campus publications and continued his involvement in sports.  Brundage played basketball and ran track for Illinois, and also participated in several intramural sports.  In his senior year, he was a major contributor to Illinois' Western Conference championship track team, which defeated the University of Chicago (coached by Amos Alonzo Stagg).
  </p>
  <p key="2d82a097-cd6d-4eb6-ae58-8f989bede2b0">
   After graduation, Brundage began work as a construction superintendent for the leading architectural firm of Holabird &amp; Roche.  In the three years he worked for the firm, he supervised the construction of $7.5 million in buildings—3 percent of the total built in Chicago in that time-frame.  He disliked the corruption of the Chicago building trades. Brundage's biographer, Allen Guttmann, points out that the young engineer was in a position to benefit from influence if he had wanted to, as his uncle, Edward J. Brundage, was by then Republican leader of Chicago's North Side and would become Attorney General of Illinois. Brundage had been successful in a number of track and field events while at Illinois. In 1910, as a member of the Chicago Athletic Association (CAA), he finished third in the national all-around championships (an American predecessor of the decathlon), sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and continued training, aiming at the

   in Stockholm.
  </p>
  <p key="15e6fddb-a5fa-4ab0-8067-6ec3c18c8cbc">
   At Stockholm, Brundage finished sixth in the
   pentathlon
   and 16th in the decathlon.  Far behind on points, after eight events he dropped out of the decathlon, which he always regretted. He later moved up one spot in the standings in each event when his fellow American,

   </a>
   , who had won both events, was disqualified after it was shown that he had played baseball for money: this meant Thorpe was considered a professional, not an amateur as was required for Olympic participation.  Throughout his tenure as president, Brundage refused to ask the IOC to restore Thorpe's medals despite advocacy by Thorpe supporters. The committee eventually did so in 1982, after the deaths of both men. Brundage's refusal led to charges that he held a grudge for being beaten in Stockholm.
  </p>
  <p key="222163a0-a71d-445c-842d-28a6f1ce9a76">
   Upon his return to Chicago, Brundage accepted a position as construction superintendent for John Griffith and Sons Contractors. Among the structures he worked on for Griffith were the Cook County Hospital, the Morrison Hotel, the Monroe Building, and the National Biscuit Company warehouse. In 1915, he struck out on his own in construction, founding the Avery Brundage Company, of which his uncle Edward was a director. Brundage continued his athletic career as well. He was US all-around champion in 1914, 1916, and 1918. Once he had ceased to be a track star, he took up handball. As a young man, he was ranked in the top ten in the country and even in 1934, at the age of 46, he won one game out of two against Angelo Trulio, who had recently been the US national champion.

   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="c4374fee-d301-4467-a186-dcb58506f6a3">
   This ideal was best realized, Brundage believed, in amateur sports: the athlete, he stated, should compete "for the love of the game itself without thought of reward or payment of any kind", with professionals being part of the entertainment business. Amateurism, to Brundage, expressed the concept of the Renaissance man, with abilities in many fields, yet a specialist in none.
  </p>
  <p key="4925b465-0672-4b81-a355-649d8358a9bf">
   As the definition of "amateur" varied by sport, many of the battles he engaged in concerned the question of what money or valuables could an athlete accept, while retaining his amateur status, with some sports more liberal than others—in 1948, tennis allowed expense payments of up to $600 per tournament, while boxing permitted valuable prizes as awards.  Enforcement of these rules often fell to National Olympic Committees, and Brundage found them less than enthusiastic about rules which hampered their own athletes in the pursuit of medals.
  </p>
  <p key="d2997fa9-dabc-4a2a-a39d-9f4c0040a465">
   Both before and after becoming IOC president, Brundage was involved in a number of controversies involving threats to, or sometimes actual disqualification of, athletes for breach of amateur rules.  In 1932, he was part of a special committee of the IAAF which disqualified Finnish runner

   from the Los Angeles Games for allegedly accepting monetary compensation.  At the
   1948 Winter Olympics
   in St. Moritz, rival US ice hockey teams, sponsored by different accrediting organizations, came to the Games.  The dispute proved difficult, and the IOC initially voted to cancel the tournament and eliminate ice hockey as an Olympic sport, but relented as thousands of tickets had been sold by the organizers.  The team not favored by Brundage, whose organization was run by commercial rink operators, was allowed to compete. In 1972, Brundage banned Austrian skier Karl Schranz from the
   Sapporo Winter Olympics
   for commercial activities, calling him "a walking billboard".
  </p>
  <p key="4b5fddfc-59aa-4904-86bf-22e37a872a65">
   As IOC president, Brundage's views on amateurism came increasingly to be seen as outdated in the modern world, as the rules were tested by athletes who saw everyone making money but themselves. In 1962, against Brundage's opposition, the IOC amended the rules to allow sports federations to offer athletes "broken time" payments, compensating them for time missed from work, but only if they had dependents in need. In 1972, Brundage called for the elimination of the Winter Olympics after 1976, finding them hopelessly polluted by rampant commercialism, especially in
   alpine skiing
   .  In his final speech to the IOC in Munich in 1972, Brundage maintained his position on amateurism:  "There are only two kinds of competitors.  Those free and independent individuals who are interested in sports for sport's sake, and those in sports for financial reasons.  Olympic glory is for amateurs."

   (West Germany, through Brundage's lifetime) was formed in 1949.  Soon after the state's formation, its National Olympic Committee approached the IOC, seeking recognition, but there was still much animus towards Germany.  Just prior to the IOC session in Vienna in 1951 (Brundage was still vice president), the
   German Democratic Republic
   (East Germany) also formed an NOC and requested recognition.  This created controversy, as the Federal Republic and its NOC claimed to represent both West and East Germany, but did not control the latter.  Despite lengthy discussions, no resolution was reached in 1951, and the matter was put over until February 1952, when a negotiating session was scheduled for Copenhagen.  Although the East Germans came to Copenhagen, they refused to attend the session, which was eventually cancelled by Edström after the IOC officials and West Germans waited for hours in vain.  The German team which competed in Helsinki that summer was entirely West German.

   In 1954, the East Germans resumed their attempts at recognition.  The following year, after Brundage received assurances that the East German NOC was not government-run, the IOC voted to recognize it, but required that both East and West Germany compete as part of
   a single German team
   in 1956. East Germany sent only 37 athletes to the
   1956 Summer Olympics
   in Melbourne, and they lived and trained separately from their West German counterparts.  For
   the Summer Olympics
   at Rome in 1960, under continuing IOC insistence that the two states send a single team, East Germany contributed 141 of the 321 athletes; competitors from both states lived in the same area of the Olympic Village. At the

   at Rome, Italian President Giovanni Gronchi marveled, much to Brundage's delight, that the IOC had obtained the German reunification which politicians had been unable to secure; Brundage responded, "But in sport, we do such things." Brundage saw the German participation as symbolic of the potential for the Olympic Games to overcome divisions to unite.

   Despite the construction of the Berlin Wall beginning in 1961, which increased tensions between East and West, Brundage was successful in securing a joint German team for the
   1964 Summer Olympics
   in Tokyo.  Nevertheless, the East Germans, supported by IOC members from Warsaw Pact nations, aspired to have their own team.  They made a major breakthrough when the IAAF (led by the Marquess of Exeter, the former Lord Burghley) recognized a separate East German team beginning with the 1966 European Athletics Championships.  The East Germans did their best to get Brundage's support, and, at the IOC session at Mexico City in 1968, they were granted full membership, with their own team under their own flag, which they displayed on West German soil four years later at the Opening Ceremony at Munich.  Brundage, while finally supporting full membership for East Germany, considered the matter a defeat for Olympic ideals.

   Although Czarist Russia had sent athletes to the Olympic Games, after the
   Soviet Union
   was formed, it declined to participate, considering the Olympics bourgeois.  As early as 1923, the IOC attempted to lure the Soviets back into the fold; Brundage visited the USSR in 1934.  He was impressed by the progress which had been made there since a visit he had made in 1912 after competing in Stockholm.  Despite his anti-Communism, Brundage wanted the Russians to join the Olympic movement.  According to Guttmann, "When Brundage had to choose between his hostility to Communism and his commitment to the ideal of Olympic universality, he chose the latter.  He wanted the Russians in the Olympics, Communists or not."
  </p>
  <p key="39ffa845-3a18-4f11-9eea-d2726c9bdc9b">
   During World War II, Brundage wrote to other IOC members that he had no objection to Soviet involvement in international sports, with representation on the IOC, if the USSR joined the international sports federations (ISFs).  The IOC required that an NOC be independent of the government of the territory which it represents; there were concerns a Soviet NOC would not be.  This was a problem not unique to communist states; a number of Latin Americans countries were starting to bring the local NOCs into the political structure, with an official naming the NOC chair—who might even be the country's political leader.  This mixture of sports and politics worried Brundage.
  </p>
  <p key="661b1388-b266-4de7-ada2-baa1c2732ffb">
   Beginning in 1946, the Soviets began to join international federations; in 1951 their NOC was recognized by the IOC, and they began Olympic competition the following year.  As few Soviet sports officials were internationally known, the IOC had little alternative than to accept the nominees of the USSR's government if they wished to have Soviet IOC members.  The Soviet members were believers in sport, and completely loyal to their nation and to communist ideals.  They quickly became the leaders of the IOC members from behind the Iron Curtain, who voted in accord with the Soviet members.  Brundage visited the USSR at Soviet invitation (though at his own expense) in 1954.  He deemed the nation's physical education program as "creating the greatest army of athletes the world has ever seen," warning (as he would often through the 1950s) that Americans were by comparison soft and unfit. Brundage found his view, often expressed in the press, that physical education and competitive sports made for better citizens, especially in the event of war, more enthusiastically embraced in the Soviet Union than in the United States.  According to David Maraniss in his account of the 1960 Rome Games, Brundage's admiration for the Soviet Union's sports programs "in some ways mirrored his response two decades earlier to his encounters with Nazi Germany".

   that he had confronted Soviet officials with information from defectors stating that the USSR was running year-round training camps and giving athletes material inducements for success. He also repeated the Soviet response, which questioned the defectors' integrity: "These men are deserters, traitors.  Would you attach any truth to their statements had they been Americans and had turned against your country?"  Since Brundage did not comment on the response, there was a storm of controversy in the press, which accused Brundage of being a Soviet dupe.

   Despite the evident conflicts between amateurism and the Soviet system in which athletes received stipends, jobs, and housing at state expense, Brundage took no action against the USSR or Warsaw Pact nations with similar systems; when challenged on this point, he argued that Western nations had similar abuses, such as athletic scholarships.  The Soviet system remained in place, though Western nations reacted by giving their athletes greater state support.

   The
   Republic of China
   , which then governed the mainland, had joined the Olympic movement in 1924, when the China National Amateur Athletic Federation was recognized by the IOC as the nation's NOC.  China participated in the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles, as well as in Berlin four years later and the first post-war Olympics at London in 1948.  When the communists were successful in the Chinese Civil War and established the
   People's Republic of China
   (PRC) in 1949, most NOC members fled the mainland for the island of
   Taiwan
   .  This left China with two rival NOCs, one on the mainland and one on Taiwan, each claiming to represent the whole of China.
  </p>
  <p key="0257d630-d559-4c82-9e56-14fe319a117e">
   Matters came to a head in 1952, when the mainland NOC (the All-China Athletic Federation), considering itself a continuation of the pre-1949 committee, wrote to the IOC stating that it desired to participate in the Helsinki Olympics to be held that year.  As the Taiwanese also proposed to send a team, this conflicted with IOC rules stating that only one committee could represent a country, and both Chinese groups were unwilling to negotiate with the other, or to send a joint team.  After considerable deliberation, the IOC decided that if either committee was recognized by the ISF for a sport, the committee could send athletes to participate in events in that discipline.  In protest, Taiwan withdrew from the Games; the PRC sent a team to Helsinki, though it arrived ten days after the start of the Games.  Brundage, president-elect when the decision was made to allow PRC athletes to compete, argued against the decision to allow mainland participation before its NOC was recognized, but he was overruled by his colleagues.
  </p>
  <p key="95b9ec27-9a83-41c3-a25c-e0dbb69eb65e">
   In 1954, the Brundage-headed IOC, in a narrow vote, recognized both committees, thus allowing both states to participate at Melbourne.  Only the PRC's committee initially accepted, but when the Taiwanese NOC changed its mind and decided to send a team to the Games, the mainlanders withdrew in protest.  Brundage took the position that despite similar concerns about state sponsorship as with the USSR, once the PRC's committee was recognized and reported to the IOC that all eligibility rules were observed, the international committee had to accept that unless it had evidence to the contrary.  He was frustrated by the continuing controversy, considering the squabble a distraction from the goal of advancing the Olympic movement.

  <p key="d707ac81-4bc2-4eb3-afcb-56d26459bafd">
   When continuing efforts to exclude the Taiwanese failed, in 1958 the mainlanders withdrew from the IOC.  The following year, the IOC ruled the Taiwanese could not compete under the name Republic of China Olympic Committee, but would have to compete under some other name which did not imply they governed sports in China. Brundage and Exeter both advocated for the ruling, which they compared to having an Italian NOC represent only Sicily.  The press interpreted the ruling to mean that Nationalist China had been expelled from the Olympic movement, and for the next year, the anti-communist Brundage found himself under attack in the press as a communist sympathizer. Although United States State Department officials attempted to persuade them to stand on principle, Taiwanese officials decided to participate in the Rome Games, hoping to secure China's first medal, and believing their NOC's continued presence helped keep mainland China out of the Games. Islanders competed under the designation Formosa (an alternate name for Taiwan), and caused a sensation by briefly displaying a sign reading "Under Protest" at the Opening Ceremony; when

   Brundage, through his tenure, slowly came around to the position advocated by Iron Curtain IOC members, that the important thing was to recognize the mainland, with Taiwan of less importance. Although the mainland Chinese were invited by the Munich Olympic organizers to send an observer delegation to Munich (they declined due to the Taiwanese presence), it was not until 1975, after Brundage's departure as president, that the PRC applied to rejoin the Olympic movement. The PRC again participated at the

   In the late 1950s, protest against South Africa's apartheid regime reached the stage of seeking to exclude the nation from international sport.  In 1956, government rules requiring separate events for whites and non-whites in South Africa were issued; non-whites received poorer facilities.  Brundage initially opposed taking any action. The run-up to the 1960 Rome Olympics had seen tumult in South Africa, including the Sharpeville massacre and a crackdown on the African National Congress.  Activists attempted to persuade Brundage that South Africa should be excluded from the Games.  Brundage initially took the word of South African sport leaders that all citizens were able to compete for a place on the Olympic team, and that non-white South Africans simply were not good enough.
  </p>
  <p key="25b8a563-b156-4d92-aeeb-bc525d97389f">
   The drive towards a boycott was fueled by the large number of African nations which became independent in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  To prevent the new nations from overwhelming the ISFs, Brundage proposed that the federations adopt weighted voting systems to allow earlier members to wield disproportionate influence, which some did. By 1962, with the suspension of South Africa from FIFA (the
   association football
   governing body), Brundage had come around to the position that South Africa's racist policies were inconsistent with the ideals of the Olympic movement.  At the 1963 IOC session in Baden-Baden (moved there from Nairobi when Kenyan officials refused to issue visas to South African representatives), the IOC voted to suspend South Africa from the Olympics unless its NOC and government adopted non-discrimination policies regarding Olympic selection.  This did not come to pass, and South Africa did not participate in 1964.  In 1968, Brundage and the IOC invited a South African team (supposedly to be multiracial) to the Mexico City Games, but under a threatened boycott and with evidence of minimal South African compliance, withdrew it.

  <p key="fdbc59d5-9ca5-46ad-ad4d-c35a0cd509f3">
   In 1971, the IOC, at its Amsterdam session, voted to strip the South African NOC of recognition.  Although Brundage had hoped to keep South Africa within the Olympic movement, he believed that those who sought its expulsion had made the stronger case. South Africa did not return to the Olympics until the
   1992 Summer Olympics
   in Barcelona, after the end of its apartheid government.

   A parallel problem was that of Rhodesia, the British colony which had unilaterally declared its independence from Great Britain in 1965. Rhodesia had a white minority government and racist policies comparable to South Africa's. In May 1968, the United Nations Security Council condemned its government and asked nations not to honor its passports, and the Mexican government, set to host the Olympics later that year, complied with the ban.  The IOC initially believed that sports facilities in the breakaway colony were not segregated, despite its government's policies. The proposed 16-member Olympic team included two black athletes. Because of this, Brundage supported Rhodesian participation at Mexico City, but he was overruled by the IOC; according to the head of the Rhodesian Olympic Committee, Douglas Downing, "His voice cries in a wilderness of spite." For Munich in 1972, the IOC decided to allow the Rhodesians to compete as British subjects, which by international law they were.  African nations again threatened to boycott if the Rhodesians were allowed to participate, and, at its Munich session in 1972 just before the Games, the IOC narrowly voted to exclude the Rhodesians. Brundage was livid at the decision, believing that the IOC had yielded to blackmail. In 1974, after Brundage left office, the IOC found evidence of segregated facilities in Rhodesia, and it subsequently withdrew recognition from its NOC. Rhodesia returned to the Olympics

Prior to the Olympics in Mexico City in October 1968, some African Americans, led by activist Harry Edwards, had urged a boycott of the Games, but found little enthusiasm among athletes, reluctant to waste years of effort.

In the early morning of September 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists from the organization Black September entered the Olympic Village and took 11 Israelis hostage, demanding freedom for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli custody.  Brundage, once informed, rushed to the Olympic Village, where he conferred with German and Bavarian state officials through the day, playing what Guttmann describes as a modest role in the discussions.  German officials moved the hostages and their captors to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, where German police and troops tried a rescue late that evening.  The attempt was bungled; the nine remaining hostages (two had been murdered earlier) and three of their captors were killed.

When Brundage was asked by reporters about the 48-year difference in their ages, Brundage responded that that he was young for his age and she mature for hers, and instead of 85 years to 37, it should be thought of as more like 55 to 46. Ruegsegger refused to be best man and stated after Brundage's death that the couple had dissipated much of Brundage's fortune through free spending, though Guttmann notes that some of those purchases were of real estate, which could be deemed investments.

   In January 1974, Brundage underwent surgery for cataracts and glaucoma. The necessary arrangements had initially been made by Brundage's protégé, Spanish IOC member

   , who would become IOC president in 1980. At the last moment, Brundage canceled the plans, choosing to have the surgery in Munich, near the home he had purchased in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, site of the
   1936 Winter Olympics
   . After a month and a half, Brundage was discharged from the hospital, though whether the surgery had improved his vision was disputed, with Mariann Brundage stating that it did and Ruegsegger stating the contrary. Now frail, at age 87 he went with his wife on a final tour of the Far East. Despite the efforts of Olympic officials on his behalf, he was not given an invitation to mainland China, source of much of
   the art he loved
   . In April 1975, Brundage entered the hospital at Garmisch-Partenkirchen with the flu and a severe cough. He died there on May 8, 1975, of heart failure.

   In his will, Brundage provided for his wife and for Ruegsegger, as well as making several charitable bequests. He left his papers and memorabilia to the University of Illinois; he had already given it $350,000 to fund scholarships for students interested in competing in sports who do not receive an athletic scholarship.

   Retrospective news coverage has sometimes judged Brundage harshly:  in May 2012,

   averred that Brundage "admired Hitler and infamously replaced two Jewish sprinters on the 4-by-100 relay team because it could have further embarrassed Hitler if they won".

   Brundage leaves an uncertain legacy.  On the question of amateurism, Maraniss suggests that Brundage was "caught in a vise"  between communist and capitalist states pursuing dissimilar goals; nations following either system were not willing to accept Brundage's vision of pure amateurism, and broke those rules, each system in its own way. Guttmann notes that in the 1960s, Brundage may have been better-known as an art collector than for his sports activities, and "there are those who maintain that he will be remembered not for his career in sports but for his jades and bronzes." Dick Pound believes Brundage to have been one of the IOC's great presidents, along with de Coubertin and Samaranch, but concedes that by the end of his term, Brundage was out of touch with the world of sports.  While Pound credits Brundage with holding the Olympic movement together in a period when it was beset by many challenges, he notes that this might not be fully appreciated by those who remember Brundage for the final years of his term, and for Munich.
