   and opening ceremony of that particular Olympiad. Its design is up to the discretion of the host country's Olympic committee and often looks quite a bit different than a traditional cauldron. In addition, the process of lighting it is special in its own way as a different method is usually utilized at each Games; some examples being a fiery arrow shot in an arc into the cauldron and the final torch bearer of the relay being lifted up by a harness to the location of the cauldron.

   The only requirement placed upon the creation and positioning of the structure is that it is in the open air of the host city, though as demonstrated at the
   2010 Winter Olympic Games
   in Vancouver, a torch can be lit inside a stadium as well.
