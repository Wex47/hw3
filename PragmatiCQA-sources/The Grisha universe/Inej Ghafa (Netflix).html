Despite losing their way into the Little Palace, Kaz still intends on traveling across the Fold. Arken requires 20 pounds of alabaster coal, a peck of Majdaloun jurda, and a goat. They are to meet at nightfall at the wreckage of a skiff northeast of the edge of town.

   While at the memorial wall checking for the names of her parents and brother, Inej is confronted by Kaz. She thought that if she saw their names then she could let them go. Inej's Sankta Lizabeta necklace is all that she had when she was sold to the Menagerie, and if it was worth anything, Heleen would've taken it. For Inej, it's a simple token of faith that her mother stitched. Kaz warns Inej that hope is dangerous and clouds her judgment.

   Inej and Kaz convene with Arken on the edge of town near the skiff wreck but Jesper has yet to turn up. Arken takes them across a minefield to a train hidden within the Fold. Jesper comes running in their direction with an angry mob chasing after him, but they come to a stop as Jesper runs into a minefield. Jesper gambled away the money and was forced to steal the coal, though he only made off with 16 pounds worth. Arken sits each of them down and instructs them to remain still and not to shift their weight. On his arm, Inej notices at least ten scratch marks, each an indicator of a successful cross through the Fold.

   Arken reveals that the tracks are not complete, though he's built slats on the car that rolled into place under the wheels and the turbines generate enough wind to push them to the eastern track as long as they don't shift their weight. However, the noise from the train attracts a

When Jesper begins to panic, Arken tells him to grab the goat for comfort. Having gained a bit of composure, Jesper begins firing at the volcra on the car with remarkable accuracy, buying them enough time to make it out the Fold.

   Two hours after sunset, once Jesper turns the lights out, Inej sneaks in through the dome on the roof directly above the repository, sliding down using a rope. She follows the trail of phosphorus directly to the blueprints and makes a copy. Unfortunately, the guards turn the valve back on and make their runs through the repository, preventing Inej from leaving the way she got in. Once the coast is clear, Jesper shoots the locking mechanism on the door as the clock tower rings, allowing Inej to escape without incident.

   Inej, Jesper, and Arken arrive at the Little Palace as part of Marko's traveling troupe, whereas Kaz sneaks in disguised as a guard. Kaz shares his findings of the door-less fitting room with a Grisha lock. Fortunately, the locking mechanisms are Fabrikator-designed and can be opened with a lodestone, which Arken just so happens to have in his possession. Since Arken is the only one of them familiar with Grisha locks, Kaz says that Arken will grab Alina. The rest of them will be setting up a lynx flush. Inej explains that lynx are pack hunters who are very smart. They'll clear a path for the prey. In this case, Kaz, Jesper, and Inej, are the lynx who will clear the path.

   Inej and Kaz enter the ballroom and witness as Alina invoked her sun summoning abilities, bringing light to the entire room, much to Inej's amazement. After Arken is captured by guards, Kaz reveals that the lynx flush was to smoke out Arken as punishment for conspiring with

   The Crows arrive In Ryevost with Alina in the trunk. They explain to her that they can provide safe passage across the Fold, but Alina would rather travel alone, refusing to be anyone else's captive. When Kaz attempts to stop her from leaving, she blinds him and Jesper, though Inej is fast enough to conceal her eyes. With her having such a great deal of respect for the Sun Summoner, she allows for Alina to flee.
  </p>
  <p key="a6b2fb56-6247-437c-b84d-32a39c4a5f1f">
   Kaz questions why Inej allowed for the target to get away. Inej explains that they were hired to pick up a fake, not nab a living Saint. However, Kaz isn't convinced that she is an actual Sun Summoner. He believes that what they witnessed was nothing more than tricks and illusions. He warns Inej that they can't work effectively as a crew if she's making decisions based on religious zeal. Kaz' is due to the fact that if they don't return with Alina then Heleen will get the Crow Club.

   Having wasted enough time searching for Alina, Kaz starts to contemplate their return to Ketterdam when the alarm in their wagon goes off. The Crows flee in different directions, agreeing to meet up later. Inej battles with the Inferni twin sister of the man she killed back at the Little Palace. Inej is injured during the battle, but she ultimately manages to defeat the Inferni, stabbing her in the abdomen with a knife. Initially, Inej offers her a chance at survival, telling the Inferni to keep the blade in until a
   Healer
   is nearby or else she will bleed out in 30 seconds. When the Inferni says that she will kill everyone that Inej has ever loved, Inej removes the blade herself. Inej then reconvenes with her comrades and steal the Darkling's carriage.

   Between their dwindling funds, lack of time, and conflicting interests, Kaz decides it's best to cut their losses and return to Ketterdam. In the meantime, Inej stitches up her wound, an ability that she learned at the Menagerie, which she refuses to go back to, though she would have to should they return to Ketterdam empty-handed. Jesper contemplates telling Inez to trust Kaz and that he'd never let her go back, but he realizes that he doesn't have the right to tell her what she should do with her shot at freedom.

  <p key="3995e790-f1cb-4ecb-9fb3-9ccecf7aa094">
   Inej joins Kaz by the fire with his cane and reveals that she's leaving. He admits that she was right about the Sun Summoner being real, though he still doesn't think she's a Saint, merely a Grisha with a unique ability. If not Saints, Inej asks what Kaz believes in. He replies that he believes in himself and his crows, including her and Jesper. Crows don't just remember the face of the people who wronged them. They also remember those who are kind. No Saint has ever watched over Kaz, not like Inez has, he admits. When Inej says that she can't go back to the Menagerie, he assures her that she won't.

   Inej, Kaz, and Jesper return to the site of Arken's train but it has been discovered by a couple of soldiers. Kaz believes he can steer the train despite the fact that Arken's system was complicated and the ride was chaotic. Suddenly, the train explodes from an alarm Arken installed. So the Crows devise a new plan to sneak onto the skiff which is scheduled to cross the Fold tomorrow. They ambush a Dignitary from the Winter Fete and his guards before stealing their clothes and their transport papers and the skiff. "No mourners," Kaz says. "No funerals," Inej replies.

   The Crows seek refuge under a deck, where they assess their options. Kaz has decided to wait for whatever it is that the General has planned, and though he may not have figured out the Darkling's exact plan, Kaz is certain he intends to attack Novokribirsk, as the look on the General's face is that of someone consumed with revenge. Inej then discovers
   Mal
   hidden below the deck as well. She holds a knife to his throat and takes his pistol. When Mal reveals that he's aboard to kill the General and save Alina, Kaz orders Inej to return Mal's gun, as they are seemingly on the same mission.

   General Kirigan expands the Fold and consumes a small portion of Novokribirs. Inej and Mal decide to make their move and head up top to stop the Darkling. Mal charges for the Darkling while Inej fights one of his Heartrenders. Inej is stopped in her tracks as he slows her heart. Fortunately,
   Zoya
   intervenes, saving Inej, who then proceeds to throw one of her knives into the chest of the Darkling after Jesper and Kaz narrowly avoid being cut in half by the Cut. However, Inej's blade does little harm, only angering the Darkling, who then proceeds to engulf their end of the ship in darkness, making them vulnerable to the volcra. As Inej and Kaz fight off the volcra, Alina regains full control of her abilities and calls on the light while Mal and  General Kirigan fight on the ground below, where the Darkling is then ripped apart by the volcra. Mal returns to the ship. Alina awakens in his grasps before sending lights throughout the Fold.

   The Crows, Alina, Mal, and Zoya gather in a clearing after escaping the Fold. Inej offers her hand to Alina. Alina replies that she likes that hand with a dagger in it and gifts Inej with a new knife, which she will call "Sankta Alina." She then pays Kaz off with royal jewelry in exchange for his silence about her whereabouts. Inej recalls Kaz berating her for letting Alina go, but he's now doing just that. Kaz explains that he's keeping his promise to Inej. He swore that she wouldn't go back to the Menagerie, and one of the gemstones from Alina will cover her debt. Inej contemplates joining Alina, but Kaz wants her to stay with him. Inej agrees to return to Ketterdam only to see the look on Helen's face when they pay her debt in full. She's not sure what will follow after.

   Inej, Kaz, and Jesper board a ship headed for home. Kaz plots their next move. Both Dreesen and
   Pekka Rollins
   will be after their heads when they return. Just like with how their initial plan started, they'll need a Heartrender.

   , Inej is morally unwavering. She believes that killing, especially unjustly, is reprehensible. However, she is willing to do so in self-defense or in defense of her loved ones, such as
   Kaz
   , as seen when she killed the
   Inferni
   twins. She is also quite religious and very much so a traditionalist, instilling her faith in the Saints.
