When his service ended, he left Ravka in order to apprentice with a shipwright, a civil engineer, and a gunsmith, excelling in all professions. This led him to begin his life as Sturmhond, taking on that alias (that was given to him by feeding a captain's fingers to his dog) because he quickly realized that on the sea, a prince would be more valuable as a hostage than a captain. He, therefore, concealed his real identity from all but his most trusted crew members – Tolya,

   Rusalye
   , which the Darkling believes to be real.

Nikolai points out that Saints have to be martyred, and so long as that power still exists, the Darkling cannot be a Saint. Yuri promises to help Nikolai get rid of the monster as a result.

In preparation, Elizaveta trains Nikolai to call the monster forth at will, helping him to better understand the nature of the creature within him. Recognizing Nikolai's attachment to Zoya, Elizaveta temporarily drowns her in order to prompt the transformation. It works, and Zoya willingly submits to multiple sessions of torture to help her King. At the same time, Juris, having earlier destroyed Zoya's

   When Nikolai undergoes the ritual, Elizaveta betrays him, revealing that she had secretly saved the Darkling's body from its funeral pyre and intends not to destroy him, but to bring him back to life. Yuri has been helping her and deliberately betrays Nikolai. Despite beating the demon in his battle for control of his body, Nikolai looks set to die. Zoya comes to his rescue, her powers vastly enhanced by a new amplifier - one made from the dragon scales of Juris, his final gift to her. Zoya is able to destroy the Darkling's body, kill Elizaveta with her own thorns, and revive Nikolai. Having lost all track of time, they head back to the capital with Yuri in bonds.

   On their return, they discover that Genya, David, Tamar, and Tolya have done their best to conceal the disappearance of their King. An Autumn Festival had been planned, in reality, to attempt diplomacy with their neighbors, under the mask of finding a Queen for Nikolai. A palace guard named

He also makes a trade agreement with the Kerch in order to secure the support of both countries against Fjerda, who are now marching on Ravka with a pretender to the Ravkan throne at their head. This pretender has the support of Magnus Opjer, who claims to have proof that he is Nikolai's true father.

   These are the problems ahead. Nikolai then reveals two pieces of bad news; the monster remains inside him, though it has been weakened, and the Darkling's return was successful. On the way back to Ravka, Nikolai had discovered that since his own body had been unavailable, the Darkling has taken up residence inside Yuri. Nikolai intends to keep him in custody as he is the key to getting rid of the monster inside him, and since they are about to be at war, he intends to use every resource he has. The Darkling, still bound, tells them that it's good to be home.

   As Sturmhond, he appears to be cocky and brash, always "using ten words when two would have sufficed." He is rather mysterious; no one is able to tell where he is from or what his real name is. Sturmhond is said to have the respect of his crew, not their fear; he is able to retain their loyalty without resorting to threats of power plays that Alina has seen the Darkling employ, and it is said that he "does things his own way," implying that he abides by his own rules rather than conventional ones.
  </p>
  <p key="abc7981f-e42e-4861-af21-1356f2560b6a">
   He is shown to be proficient with a number of weapons and is always seen to be bearing an assortment of weapons, including a brace of pistols, several knives, and a sword. He seems to have a particular fondness for the sword, even being willing to instruct Mal in the use of it. Usually, Sturmhond is observed wearing a bright teal frock coat with gaudy gold buttons and huge cuffs that Alina thinks would be more at home in a ballroom than on a ship's deck. When Alina and Mal dine with him, he shows a preference for fine cooking – the ship's crew includes a chef employed for this purpose. In conversation, he is jovial and intentionally lighthearted; though, when he is challenged, he betrays a much harder edge.
  </p>
  <p key="8b172fa7-f717-495c-914d-6854981c241e">
   Alina and Mal are impressed by Nikolai's ability to appeal to the people around them and present them with a persona that they want to see. During this time, he shows himself to be extremely socially intelligent and willing to do whatever he can to manipulate the public into supporting him. He is really fair and just and cannot stand the mistreatment of innocent people. Nikolai is very intelligent and is said to excel at practically anything he tries. Nikolai suffers from being told he is ‘Nikolai Nothing’ by his brother and comments about his parentage but he hides his insecurities and does his best to satisfy everyone. He is adored by the public.

   When he first appears disguised as Sturmhond, he is described as a tall boy with hair of a strange shade of red, muddy green eyes, a nose that looks as if it has been broken and badly set several times, and an overly pointy chin. He looks to be around 19 or 20 years old
   and looks "too young to be the captain of anything." Alina thinks that there is something strange about his face that she cannot place.

   Later on, Sturmhond reveals himself to be Nikolai Lantsov. Nikolai has golden blond hair, neatly cut to military length, hazel eyes, and his nose slightly crooked but "nothing like the busted lump it had been." Alina later remarks that he has a handsome face "cut in the lines of a fairy tale prince." He is described as extremely charming and handsome.

   One night, Nikolai escapes his bonds while in his monster form and flies to a town called Balakirev. Tolya, Tamar, and Zoya follow him. Zoya with her Grisha powers makes it to the top of the bell tower where she discovers that the monster is hungry for human blood. Zoya fights Nikolai and he suddenly attacks her after saying her name with the Darkling's voice, which distracts her and causes her to get injured. Luckily, Tolya steps up and saves her from being eaten by the monster. After that night she tries to avoid Nikolai, even if it was not him that night. Nikolai tries to have a moment with her alone to apologize but it is not possible since they are planning a trip to try to kill the monster inside him.

   Weeks after, and during the trip to the Fold, while Zoya was chaining Nikolai, he achieves to apologize. However, Zoya reveals that if they can´t get the monster out of him, she would kill him in order to save Ravka from himself. Nikolai reveals he will help her do it himself if the time comes.

   When they are working side by side on some documents, and writing letters, Zoya admits to herself that she rather likes Nikolai, and that she will miss being comfortable with him and teasing him when he has a wife. She confesses that she isn’t sure if she could make Nikolai fall in love with her and that some part of her wants to try. Zoya thinks that she never desires but is desired but is suspicious that it is the other way around with her and Nikolai.

   After the secret of Sturmhond's identity is revealed, Nikolai proposes to Alina as a political move. He says the marriage would be purely political except in the matter of making heirs, which then provokes Mal. Alina turns him down, but they present a united front on their trip through the cities on their way to Os Alta. Outside of Tashta, Nikolai kisses Alina, and the crowd goes wild. Alina, in return, kicks his shin in private, and Mal is once again furious with Nikolai. On her third attempt at kicking Nikolai, he grabs her bare leg, which makes her blush. The developing relationship between Alina and Nikolai becomes a theme as they arrive at Court. Their allegiance develops quickly, with Nikolai first revealing to his parents that he is Sturmhond and then supporting Alina and Mal as they face the King. Alina is put in charge of the Grisha (the Second Army), just as she had wanted, and Mal is installed as her head guard. Tolya and Tamar, the twins from Sturmhond's ship, make up the rest of her guard, and she takes over the Darkling's old rooms while Nikolai sets himself up at Court.

   Alina and Nikolai present themselves as a united front, attending meetings together. Vasily proposes marriage to Alina just as his brother had done. She refuses any kind of familiarity with him, and as time goes on, she starts to view Nikolai more kindly. Though she acknowledges that it can be hard to trust him, since it's not clear whether he is ever really being himself or simply wearing whatever mask he thinks she wants to see, she spends an increasing amount of time talking with him. For his part, Nikolai appears to become more vulnerable around her than around anyone else. Eventually, he even seems to become willing to talk about personal matters with her.

   He talks again about the rumors that he is a bastard, admitting to Alina that he has heard those rumors all his life and that he is perhaps not so unaffected by it as he may seem. He makes reference to his childhood nickname,

   , which means "puppy," and says that his mother had refused to call him that because she thought it made him sound like a mongrel. Alina, who had been raised as an orphan, connects with him over this since she remembers being called many names herself. She begins to get angry when she hears people questioning his birth, even when they are strangers, to the extent that Mal furiously asks her why she's so quick to defend Nikolai.
  </p>
  <p key="996b5b21-a78e-4815-8399-73cb38549336">
   Nikolai rises in Alina's esteem. She seems to be not only his ally but his friend. At the same time, Alina's relationship with Mal – in theory still her romantic partner – deteriorates. Mal is shown to dislike the Little Palace and to have reservations over how powerful Alina is becoming and whether it is changing her. Alina, who has some doubts over this herself, feels a distance growing between her and Mal and suffers due to her continued "visions" of the Darkling. She seems, in general, to be more at ease in Nikolai's company. As his birthday approaches, he even comes close to kissing her, telling her that he wants to but will not until he's sure she's not just trying to forget Mal. Nikolai waits for Alina to give up on Mal and for her to marry him to form an alliance. He even thinks they could have more than a political marriage and grow to love each other. Alina officially turns Nikolai's proposal to rule the Second Army down at the end of
