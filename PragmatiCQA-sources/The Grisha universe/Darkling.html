After covering the room in darkness, he tried to call out to the magic inside her, but she actively resisted. Instead of falling for her trick, the Darkling decided to use physical force, cutting her arm with a knife, and the pain triggered a response in Alina: a blazing white light that shattered the darkness he conjured.

   The Darkling is a living amplifier, a person who can increase a Grisha's powers. There are also inanimate objects that are used as amplifiers but only the Darkling's most favored Grisha are allowed to have them.

   When he caught Alina and Mal after they ran away, he used the stag's antlers to bind her to him, and then he revealed that he planned on having Mal killed by the volcra. He used Alina's powers to show his own powers over the Fold and easily scared the ambassadors and envoys that came along for the demonstration into submission. When he ordered Mal to be thrown overboard, Alina broke free from his control and left the people on the boat to fend off the volcra themselves. The Darkling was one of the only people to have survived the volcra attack.

He revealed to Alina that his ability to manipulate darkness evolved into manifesting abominations/volcra-like creatures that cannot be destroyed by light, he called them

   could not stop the blight. The Shadow Fold was a tear in the fabric of the universe, also known as "The making at the heart of the world". Before the making, there was nothing, only void, that void was seeping into the world through the tear, known to them as the blight.

  <p key="a3f0af29-c109-4ffe-82be-f7ec43f1e914">
   There was no way to close the tear, someone had to hold it closed standing at the doorway between the void and creation for eternity. The members of the Order explained that the person doing this would suffer so much that death would be kindness. With this information the group was debating who should sacrifice themselves, Nikolai and Zoya were debating which one of them should do it when the Darkling volunteered himself saying he was the only one who was truly immortal and more powerful than Zoya. The only thing he asked of them was that they built him an altar so that he could be remembered in the books as a saint, the Starless One.

Before his heart was pierced by the thorn and his screaming body was swallowed by the thorn wood tree, he uttered his last words: "My name is Aleksander Morozova, but I have had hundred names and I have committed a thousand crimes. I am not sorry. I do not repent! All I did, I did for Ravka!".

However, he is also shown to truly care for and wants to be loved by his people (the Grisha) and his nation, claiming that all he ever wanted was to create a safe place for people like him.

Before Alina left the Little Palace, the Darkling kissed her abruptly by the lake, after he told her about the stag he was hunting.

   Later on, their connection became deeper and more complex as the Darkling could visit Alina at will in a tangible and accurate form: Alina was, of course, disturbed by their encounters and asked him why he won't leave her alone.

At the Chapel, Alina and the Darkling were able to manipulate each other's abilities through a particular bond. When they meet each other at the Chapel, he reveals that her visions were real and promises that he would never turn away from who she truly was, for they were alike as no one else was.

   Alina paid him a visit by the tether shared between them. He asked her why, only to say that she, in fact, wanted to see him. He told her that she was destined to be his balance and could make him a better man, to which she replied he could make her a monster. He offered her the throne sitting beside his, despite the fact that she attempted to kill him. He told Alina his real name, which earned him a lighthearted laugh from her, commenting on how common his name was. The laugh was then returned with a genuine smile from the Darkling, who tries to kiss and touch her. She, even though feeling the strong beat of desire in both sides through their connection, resists his advances. At the final battle on the Fold, the Darkling panics and suffers over Alina's loss of power, realizing she was no longer his balance and he was truly alone in the world, being distracted enough to let her stab him with a knife. She cried over his body and obeyed his request to not have a grave that people could desecrate. The Darkling's corpse is later burned and Alina whispers his true name, Aleksander, above it.

   The Darkling had a very difficult relationship with his mother, Baghra. She told Alina that Grisha used to be heavily persecuted even in Ravka and she was always shunned for being able to summon darkness, which was an extremely rare power, and never wanted her son to suffer as she did. She raised him to be hard and strong and gave him pride (teaching that he had no equal and was destined to bow to no man) and ambition (teaching that love was fragile, fickle and nothing compared to power) so he would rely on no one but himself. As a child, Baghra praised his abilities in reading the flow of power, which would make him a great leader, and instructs him to never trust others or let anyone touch him, for that could be dangerous. She also refers to common Grisha and otkazat'sya as being dust, for her son would easily outlive all of them, and tells him she would burn a thousand villages and kill a thousand people to keep him safe. He vowed to make a safe haven for Grisha, which was the seed of the Second Army, but eventually, his thirst for power overcame him and his cruelty increased until the creation of the Shadow Fold. Baghra no longer supported him, criticizing and opposing him in every decision, and ultimately betraying him. She told Alina about his past and true intentions and urged her to escape the Little Palace, believing he could still be redeemed if he wasn't successful in his evil plans. It cost her dearly, as he ended up blinding her as a punishment, but she didn't regret it. She sacrificed her own life as a distraction, and despite her son's efforts, he was unable to stop her from taking her own life. Alina later feels him grieving through their link.
