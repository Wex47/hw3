   Royal family
   and higher-ranking nobles, he insisted on serving in the infantry as an ordinary Ravkan and earned his final rank of Major on merit. When his service ended, he left Ravka in order to apprentice with a shipwright, a civil engineer, and a gunsmith, excelling in all professions. This led him to begin his life as Sturmhond, taking on that alias (that was given to him by feeding a captain's fingers to his dog) because he quickly realized that on the sea, a prince would be more valuable as a hostage than a captain. He, therefore, concealed his real identity from all but his most trusted crew members – Tolya,
   Tamar Kir-Bataar

   Privyet
   , and a few of the

   He found that as Sturmhond, he was able to amass resources and mount offenses that were not possible for the Ravkan navy and that he had done more to support Ravka's war effort as a privateer than he ever had as a soldier or a prince. However, leading this life had meant that he was at sea when the Darkling made his attempt on the throne, and now his father, King Alexander III's health was failing.

   Nikolai is first introduced as an infamous privateer known as Sturmhond, a young captain commanding his own personal fleet of ships which he uses to aid the war effort of his native Ravka. He and his crew have been hired by the Darkling to transport him and a group of his Grisha through the icy seas in their hunt for a supposedly mythical dragon,
   Rusalye
   , which the Darkling believes to be real.
  </p>
  <p key="fd9d246b-4b65-4665-9e1a-d59e4ffa431f">
   The Darkling has, at this point, captured Alina and her partner Mal, and they are held prisoner aboard Sturmhond's ship, the
   <i key="7fa2df9c-67c6-4e9a-8b1f-741025ea1340">

   . Sturmhond refuses to listen to Alina's entreaty to help her against the Darkling but opposes the Darkling's mistreatment of Alina.
  </p>
  <p key="bcad7139-6da1-4973-be81-435474a070ad">
   Just as Rusalye, the dragon, is harpooned, Sturmhond leads his crew in a revolt against the Darkling, fleeing with Alina and Mal and shooting the Darkling in the process. Sturmhond reveals that he had not been working for the Darkling and was instead working for a higher bidder in Ravka. He convinces Alina to come with him, befriending her and Mal.

   crashes in the lake outside of
   Kribirsk
   , and the group is found by members of the Ravkan
   First Army
   . Sturmhond takes off his coat to reveal he is wearing a military uniform beneath it, and he introduces himself – not as Sturmhond but as Nikolai Lantsov, the second son of the Ravkan King and therefore a prince.

   After a startled Alina punches him, Nikolai takes control of the situation and convinces the soldiers to bring her and Mal to their camp as guests rather than prisoners. Once there, he enters their tent and explains himself. Nikolai reveals his ambition to return home and become his father's heir. He believes that his older brother, who is more concerned with horses and hunting than with politics, will step aside.
  </p>
  <p key="02f51511-9815-4676-abfe-2bb266a618cc">
   Nikolai asks Alina to return with him to Ravka and help him to defeat the Darkling. He also proposes marriage to her, suggesting that such an alliance would make both of them stronger and allow them to unite the First and
   Second Armies
   against the Darkling. He insists that he is talking about a political alliance and not a love match; though, he says he is not opposed to having children with her. He hints that he would be willing to have an open relationship with Alina if she still wanted to see Mal. Alina refuses, and Mal grows to resent Nikolai. Mal even pins Nikolai to a wall and starts a fight with him, and Alina breaks up the argument. However, she agrees to support Nikolai's bid for the throne if he will support her in taking the Darkling's place as leader of the Grisha of the Second Army. Surprised, Nikolai considers it and finally agrees.

   On their journey together to

Vasily arrives, seeming worryingly pleased with himself, and eventually reveals what he imagines to be a great victory over Nikolai – he has been negotiating with the Fjerdans, one of Ravka's enemies. He has arranged a trade agreement wherein some of the security stations along Ravka's border roads will be relaxed to allow traders to move freely. Nikolai reacts with horror, saying that those security outposts had been serving as an early warning system. He says that Vasily has been played and that the arrangement he has made will provide the Darkling with a direct route to the capital. Vasily scoffs at this, but Nikolai asks how long ago the agreement was reached. He realizes that with all of his family gathered together for his birthday, they have provided the perfect opportunity for the Darkling to strike. He immediately wants to evacuate.

Sturmhond is said to have the respect of his crew, not their fear; he is able to retain their loyalty without resorting to threats of power plays that Alina has seen the Darkling employ, and it is said that he "does things his own way," implying that he abides by his own rules rather than conventional ones.

He seems to have a particular fondness for the sword, even being willing to instruct Mal in the use of it. Usually, Sturmhond is observed wearing a bright teal frock coat with gaudy gold buttons and huge cuffs that Alina thinks would be more at home in a ballroom than on a ship's deck. When Alina and Mal dine with him, he shows a preference for fine cooking – the ship's crew includes a chef employed for this purpose. In conversation, he is jovial and intentionally lighthearted; though, when he is challenged, he betrays a much harder edge.

   Alina and Mal are impressed by Nikolai's ability to appeal to the people around them and present them with a persona that they want to see. During this time, he shows himself to be extremely socially intelligent and willing to do whatever he can to manipulate the public into supporting him.

Nikolai suffers from being told he is ‘Nikolai Nothing’ by his brother and comments about his parentage but he hides his insecurities and does his best to satisfy everyone.

   She is in charge of chaining Nikolai to his bed every night and unchaining him in the morning. It is especially during this ritual that their bond deepens, along with their general every day working side by side. He likes Zoya for who she is and does not wish for her to change or soften, as every other man wishes he could make her.

   One night, Nikolai escapes his bonds while in his monster form and flies to a town called Balakirev. Tolya, Tamar, and Zoya follow him. Zoya with her Grisha powers makes it to the top of the bell tower where she discovers that the monster is hungry for human blood. Zoya fights Nikolai and he suddenly attacks her after saying her name with the Darkling's voice, which distracts her and causes her to get injured. Luckily, Tolya steps up and saves her from being eaten by the monster. After that night she tries to avoid Nikolai, even if it was not him that night. Nikolai tries to have a moment with her alone to apologize but it is not possible since they are planning a trip to try to kill the monster inside him.

   Weeks after, and during the trip to the Fold, while Zoya was chaining Nikolai, he achieves to apologize. However, Zoya reveals that if they can´t get the monster out of him, she would kill him in order to save Ravka from himself. Nikolai reveals he will help her do it himself if the time comes.

   When they are working side by side on some documents, and writing letters, Zoya admits to herself that she rather likes Nikolai, and that she will miss being comfortable with him and teasing him when he has a wife. She confesses that she isn’t sure if she could make Nikolai fall in love with her and that some part of her wants to try. Zoya thinks that she never desires but is desired but is suspicious that it is the other way around with her and Nikolai.

   During their stay in the Fold, Nikolai finds out that the only way to get the monster out is when Zoya is in danger, so Elizaveta trains him to control the monster by putting her at risk. The day before the ritual to kill the monster, Nikolai asks Zoya to tell him how she got her amplifier. At one moment, Zoya shrugs the silk of her

He also hints at being jealous, when she mentions her past lovers, as he does not even wish to think about them. Later he wishes to be led by his heart instead of duty to make Zoya his queen.

   After the secret of Sturmhond's identity is revealed, Nikolai proposes to Alina as a political move. He says the marriage would be purely political except in the matter of making heirs, which then provokes Mal. Alina turns him down, but they present a united front on their trip through the cities on their way to Os Alta. Outside of Tashta, Nikolai kisses Alina, and the crowd goes wild. Alina, in return, kicks his shin in private, and Mal is once again furious with Nikolai. On her third attempt at kicking Nikolai, he grabs her bare leg, which makes her blush. The developing relationship between Alina and Nikolai becomes a theme as they arrive at Court. Their allegiance develops quickly, with Nikolai first revealing to his parents that he is Sturmhond and then supporting Alina and Mal as they face the King. Alina is put in charge of the Grisha (the Second Army), just as she had wanted, and Mal is installed as her head guard. Tolya and Tamar, the twins from Sturmhond's ship, make up the rest of her guard, and she takes over the Darkling's old rooms while Nikolai sets himself up at Court.

   Alina and Nikolai present themselves as a united front, attending meetings together. Vasily proposes marriage to Alina just as his brother had done. She refuses any kind of familiarity with him, and as time goes on, she starts to view Nikolai more kindly. Though she acknowledges that it can be hard to trust him, since it's not clear whether he is ever really being himself or simply wearing whatever mask he thinks she wants to see, she spends an increasing amount of time talking with him. For his part, Nikolai appears to become more vulnerable around her than around anyone else. Eventually, he even seems to become willing to talk about personal matters with her.

   He talks again about the rumors that he is a bastard, admitting to Alina that he has heard those rumors all his life and that he is perhaps not so unaffected by it as he may seem. He makes reference to his childhood nickname,

   , which means "puppy," and says that his mother had refused to call him that because she thought it made him sound like a mongrel. Alina, who had been raised as an orphan, connects with him over this since she remembers being called many names herself. She begins to get angry when she hears people questioning his birth, even when they are strangers, to the extent that Mal furiously asks her why she's so quick to defend Nikolai.

   Nikolai rises in Alina's esteem. She seems to be not only his ally but his friend. At the same time, Alina's relationship with Mal – in theory still her romantic partner – deteriorates. Mal is shown to dislike the Little Palace and to have reservations over how powerful Alina is becoming and whether it is changing her. Alina, who has some doubts over this herself, feels a distance growing between her and Mal and suffers due to her continued "visions" of the Darkling. She seems, in general, to be more at ease in Nikolai's company. As his birthday approaches, he even comes close to kissing her, telling her that he wants to but will not until he's sure she's not just trying to forget Mal. Nikolai waits for Alina to give up on Mal and for her to marry him to form an alliance. He even thinks they could have more than a political marriage and grow to love each other. Alina officially turns Nikolai's proposal to rule the Second Army down at the end of
