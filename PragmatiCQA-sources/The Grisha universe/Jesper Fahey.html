   farm in western
   Novyi Zem
   with his
   Kaelish
   father,
   Colm Fahey
   , and Zemeni mother,
   Aditi Hilli
   . They were all very close. Aditi taught him about life on the Zemeni frontier, how to shoot, and about their shared zowa (

   young girl
   from poison. Jesper and Colm buried her under a cherry tree on the farm.
  </p>
  <p key="d6e726aa-9f65-4bca-baae-f9cbf4cc2c6d">
   Colm discouraged Jesper from mentioning Grisha, and when Jesper began
   Fabrikating
   things as a child, his father told him to keep his power hidden and never use it. When Jesper was ten, Leoni's family offered to take Jesper with Leoni to train in their zowa abilities, but Jesper's father refused. Colm later offered to let Jesper go, but Jesper did not want to leave his father alone.
  </p>
  <p key="295d11f4-2707-47ea-99dd-6cfc3cde7a03">
   Both Jesper and his father recognized that Jesper did not belong on the farm. Jesper left Novyi Zem when he was fifteen to attend university in
   Ketterdam
   , but within his first week in the city he began gambling and quickly became addicted. He started taking on work with the gangs to earn more money to gamble, and joined the Dregs after
   Kaz Brekker
   saved him from a beating.

  <p key="f08a26c9-e782-4532-9b7a-1acc61acb616">
   Jesper is always deeply in debt. When his father's farm began turning a profit, Jesper used the farm as collateral for a loan, which caused several plotlines in the

   Jesper is one of Kaz's seconds for the parley with

   Black Tips
   at the Exchange. When the parley goes south and
   Big Bolliger
   is revealed as a traitor to the Dregs, Jesper is angry with Kaz for keeping this information secret, but Kaz soothes him with the bribe of a line of credit at the
   Crow Club

   Inej Ghafa

   Nina Zenik
   , and Matthias away from the island. When Kaz reveals
   Wylan Van Eck
   's identity, Jesper is deeply amused, but upset with Kaz for withholding vital information. He begins to tease Wylan mercilessly about his mercher background and lack of street knowledge. Kaz leaves Wylan and Jesper to watch out for each other and purchase the supplies necessary for the trip to

He talks briefly with Nina and reveals his fear that Inej will die. Back on deck, Kaz discusses the Ice Court maps with Jesper, Wylan, and Matthias. Jesper thinks they should abandon the job once they find out Pekka Rollins is their competition, but he eventually acquiesces to go forward with Kaz's plan.

   The crew scouts the best location for their ambush of the prison wagon. Jesper volunteers to be lookout and heads down the road to signal the rest of the group with a flare when the wagon is approaching. As they enter the prison, Jesper and Matthias briefly discuss their knowledge of tanks. The boys are taken to the men's cellblock, and Jesper is upset that he was too worried about impending death to appreciate finally seeing Kaz naked. In the holding cells, Jesper and Wylan vaguely discuss their histories, but mostly insult each other. Jesper sets off a chloro gas pellet he'd sewn into his ankle to knock out the other prisoners, then makes lockpicks from the iron bars for Kaz. Wylan is shocked by the revelation that Jesper is a Fabrikator and Jesper warns him not to tell anyone.

   Jesper and Matthias retrieve rope from the stables and return to the laundry room. After the rest of the group has climbed the incinerator shaft, Jesper worries Kaz won't make it, but Kaz returns just as Jesper prepared to climb the rope. On the roof of the prison sector, Jesper helps Inej by removing the rubber of her shoes that had fused to her feet. When Yellow Protocol shuts down the team's plan to get onto the White Island, Jesper once again suggests abandoning the plan, but Inej and Kaz form a new plan.

The boys dress in the guards' uniforms and head for the gate in the ringwall. The lifting mechanism of the gate is different than Wylan expected, so Jesper spends half an hour weakening the links of the steel chain while Wylan saws at it with shears.

The boys use ropes to climb down to Inej, and Jesper happily takes control of the tank. He blows open the glass, then drives the tank through the wall of the Ice Court, across the bridge, and through the streets of Djerholm to the harbor.

Kaz reveals that Jesper was the one who (accidentally) made Pekka Rollins realize the Crows were heading to the Ice Court. Jesper tries to fight Kaz, but Matthias and Wylan intervene. Though Jesper and Kaz's relationship is strained, Jesper accompanies Kaz, Wylan, Matthias, and Nina to the

Jesper moves Wylan's chemical powders into Kuwei's flames, turning the fire colors and stalling the Dime Lions, then the three escape Black Veil and run to Colm's suite at the Geldrenner Hotel. From the clocktower, the Crows watch as the gangs, including the Dregs, are deputized and turn against them. Jesper suggests they all hide in the countryside, but Kaz refuses. Their argument turns to a physical brawl until Colm arrives and chastises Jesper.

   Inej, having learned Jesper indirectly caused her to be stabbed on the way to the Ice Court, talks to Jesper about what it means to apologize. She also advises him to take the first step to remedy his gambling addiction, and to tell his father the truth about his situation. Jesper tells his father the truth, but Colm is angry and refuses to accept that Jesper's Grisha ability could have been a gift rather than a curse. Upset, Jesper leaves the room and finds Wylan sitting at a piano, and the two kiss. However, the real Wylan appears in the doorway, causing Jesper to realize that he just kissed Kuwei instead.

   Jesper is witty, sarcastic, cocky, and teasing, but good-natured and friendly when he wants to be. Jesper is a flirt, and shamelessly so. He angers easily but doesn't hold a grudge for long. Though he has good intentions, he doesn't always consider the consequences of his actions. Jesper is a gambler who enjoys figuring the odds of anything, whether in the cards or his own survival.
  </p>
  <p key="50833203-74d1-4919-8014-9912de1874b2">
   Jesper is restless and often anxious, and uses gunfights and gambling to distract himself with an adrenaline rush. When he feels overwhelmed he rests his hands on his pistols to keep from fidgeting. Some of his recklessness likely comes from not using his Fabrikator powers. Jesper's impulsiveness sometimes leads him to make poor decisions, which makes him feel guilty and leads to low self-esteem.

   He prefers to dress in Barrel flash: brightly-colored, patterned outfits that rarely match. He has the Dregs tattoo on his forearm. According to

   Jesper is a Grisha Fabrikator (
   Durast
   ), though in Novyi Zem he and other Grisha are referred to as zowa, meaning "blessed". However, Jesper remains untrained, so his power is not properly honed and rather weak. Still, he is able to use his power to create several items that the Crows use in their escape from the Ice Court, kill two Tidemakers on

   When a Grisha doesn't use their power, they become "sick". Although Jesper never fell ill, not using his Fabrikator ability caused a seemingly endless amount of energy to build up inside of him and made him even more impulsive, reckless, and desperate for action.

   Jesper is also a talented sharpshooter and marksman. Wylan Van Eck believes that part of the reason Jesper is such a good shot is that he subconsciously uses his Fabrikator ability to guide his bullets, a theory supported by the fact that Jesper's mother was also a Fabrikator and the one who taught him to shoot.

   Jesper is one of Wylan's contacts with the Dregs when the merchling is living in
   the Barrel
   . Both find the other attractive from their first meeting, but Jesper is amused by Wylan's lack of worldly experience. They spend most of their time while preparing for the Ice Court heist bickering and insulting each other, though Jesper's banter begins to approach flirting. On the journey to Fjerda, Jesper begins to feel something for Wylan, and flirts with him more throughout the heist. As the Crows return to Ketterdam, Jesper misses Wylan; Wylan, disguised as Kuwei, regularly visits Jesper on the ship, though Jesper believes him to be Kuwei. Jesper is furious when he learns of Jan Van Eck's disregard for his son, revealing that Jesper has become protective of Wylan.
