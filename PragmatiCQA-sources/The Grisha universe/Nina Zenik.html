   Matthias spoke with Nina one time and gave her a tin cup filled with water to drink. One night, the ship experienced a massive storm. Nina managed to cut her bonds and those of the other imprisoned Grisha using the broken water cup from Matthias, thereby escaping their cages. Matthias also survived the initial shipwreck, and Nina saved Matthias's life with her Heartrender abilities and kept them both warm through the freezing water as they swam to shore.

   They found an abandoned whaling camp and spent the night, then stuck together for three weeks as they traversed the Fjerdan landscape. Though they argued and bickered, they became allies, if not friends. When Nina nearly fell into an ice crevasse, Matthias saved her life.

   In
   Elling
   , Nina told a
   Kerch
   trader that Matthias was a slaver who had captured her. She surrendered Matthias to the Kerch in an attempt to protect him, but Matthias did not know this at the time. There were Grisha undercover in Elling who planned to take Matthias prisoner and bring him to Ravka for interrogation and execution. In accordance with Kerch law, Matthias and Nina were brought to
   Ketterdam
   . Nina tried to recant the charges, but couldn't without compromising Ravkan Grisha intelligence operations. Matthias was condemned to imprisonment at
   Hellgate
   .

  <p key="87469181-5b56-43ef-a84b-dd9e7d4bbfef">
   Nina stayed in Ketterdam instead of returning to Ravka because she wanted to get Matthias out of Hellgate. She was originally approached by
   Pekka Rollins
   and invited to join the
   Dime Lions
   , but Kaz sent
   Inej Ghafa
   to recruit Nina to the Dregs instead. Nina accepted and began working at the House of the White Rose as a member of the Dregs.
