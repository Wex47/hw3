A volcra then swoops down and digs its talons into Alina's back, causing a large explosion of light to emerge from within her, destroying the nearby volcra.

   Weeks have passed since Alina was taken to the Little Palace. Mal has written her several letters and still no word back. His unit is now stationed at Chernast, where the Fjerdans have been attacking at night. It's there that he volunteers to lead a tracking party with Mikhael and Dubrov for

   Mal, Mikhael, and Dubrov track Morozova's herd into Fjerdan territory. They set up camp and take refuge. Then suddenly Mal hears a soft high pitched sound calling to him. However, he is forced to divert his attention away from the herd when the Fjerdans attack. They manage to subdue and kill the first three, but Mikhael and Dubrov fall victim to a machine gun firing from within the trees. Mal is shot in the shoulder but suffers no fatal wounds. As the two remaining Fjerdans approach, Mal kills the two of them. Unfortunately, he is unable to save Mikhael and Dubrov, who have succumbed to their wounds. Mal manages to get back to his feet and just a few yards away, he spots the Stag — all white with remarkable antlers.

   Mal returns to his outpost on the outskirts of Chernast and reports his findings after being taken to medical. After a bit of rest, Mal and Tofin ride to the Little Palace to inform General Kirigan that they've found the Stag north of Chernast, twice as big as any other, all white with enormous antlers marked by a symbol. When Kirigan asks for the exact location he spotted the Stag, Mal requests to see Alina first, insisting that they're friends. In exchange, he will give General Kirigan the exact location of the Stag. Kirigan asks Mal to prove that he knows her by revealing something that only few would know about her, such as her favorite flower, which Mal reveals is blue iris. Assuming Mal is telling the truth, Kirigan promises to bring Alina to him.

   After months apart, Mal tracks Alina down outside a small town in Ryevost. After they're clear of the soldiers, she accuses him of ignoring her letters for months, but he insists that he wrote her. He then asks how long has she known that she was Grisha, recalling how Alina cheated on the Grisha examiner test when they were children, however, Alina insists that she didn't know until that day in the Fold. She claims that she cheated because she feared that they would be separated if she did in fact pass the test. Mal then reveals that he found the Stag. Kirigan's orders to track it came from her drawings. Alina realizes that he must've stolen her drawings and informs Mal how the Stag's antlers can be used as a Grisha amplifier to rival the General's powers. She then embraces Mal and thanks him for finding her, to which he replies "I'll always find you."

   That night, Mal and Alina find refuge in a cave. He advises Alina against starting a fire, as they are still being tracked and the smoke will lead their enemies to them. So rather than sparking a flame, Alina warms Mal with her sun summoning abilities, which Mal insists don't scare him before professing his love for her. The following morning, Alina treats Mal's wound as he tells her about his time tracking the Stag and how Mikhael and Dubrov died behind the Fjerdan border. The two then decide to hunt the Stag and use it against General Kirigan. Before long, they find themselves only a day or two behind the Stag.

Alina points a rifle at the Stag but ultimately decides against killing the creature, suddenly realizing that she can claim its power without killing it. Alina pets the Stag and her powers are instantly amplified, though only momentarily as General Kirigan arrives with his men and shoots the Stag with an arrow, wounding the creature. Mal attempts to kill the Stag before the Grisha can but is attacked by Zoya and

Alina chooses Mal, allowing General Kirigan to deliver the killing blow to the Stag, cutting the creature's head off with the Cut.

   After General Kirgan melds the Stag's antlers into both himself and Alina, he chains Mal up to a banister at the First Army's camp, though he did keep his promise and saw to it that Mal was healed of his arrow wound. Mal refers to him as the Black Heretic. He adds that whatever he has planned, Alina will never forgive him and promises to kill the General himself the first chance he gets. Kirigan admits that Alina has strong feelings for Mal and that Mal feels the same way about her judging by the letters Kirigan read between the two. General Kirigan explains that he has patience. Alina may take years to forgive him, but as Grisha, Kirigan can wait, whereas Mal will age and one day she will forget all about him and realize that she only has one equal, that being the Darkling. So he doesn't need to kill Mal, as time will do it for him.

Mal shoots two of the General's guards before being stopped in his tracks by Ivan, a Heartrender who the Darkling orders to keep Mal alive, as he may prove useful at another time. The Darkling then extends his hand to Alina. She grabs Inej's knife and stabs General Kirigan, removing the Stag's bone that was embedded in his hand, granting Alina full control of her abilities. As she calls on the light, Mal tackles General Kirigan overboard. They battle alongside the skiff. Mal keeps Kirigan distracted long enough for the volcra to sneak up behind and attack him. Mal then returns to the skiff to find Alina unconscious after being attacked by Ivan. He begs her to wake up. Alina slowly opens her eyes and lights the way for them to escape the Fold.

   Mal and Alina have been best of friends since childhood. Over the years, they took care of one another, and, unbeknownst to the other, they developed romantic feelings for each other. When Alina was denied food by the camp cook, for her Shu heritage, Mal risked imprisonment, taking fruit from Zoya's tent to share with Alina. After Alina had been discovered to being the Sun Summoner and was taken to the Little Palace, Mal's initial instinct was to go after her and protect her, even at the risk of him being hanged for desertion. He continued to write to Alina, but he never received any responding letters from her. When General Kirigan set up a reward to locate Morozova's Stag, Mal was the first person to volunteer to find it, as finding the stag would allow him an audience into the Little Palace.

   After Alina fled the little palace, Mal tracked her down, and the two were reunited. At first, they were angry at one another, thinking the other had abandoned them, because neither received the other's letters, but they soon made up. Later Alina was going to explain her personal mistakes when she was at the Little Palace, but Mal stopped her, reassuring her that he only cared about protecting her, and the two hunted for the stag to prevent Kirigan from getting to it first. Even after Mal was severely injured by the Darkling's forces, he still wanted Alina to kill the stag to prevent the Darkling from doing so and taking her prisoner. After Mal escaped imprisonment, he boarded the skiff going into the Fold, with Alina on it, and fought to free her, again, risking his own life in the process.
