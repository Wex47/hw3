   , Rasmus invites Hanne to privately view the spectacle with just the two of them. Hanne is rightfully reluctant to go, as if Rasmus proposes she would have to say yes even though she was already in a relationship with Nina at that time; and if he didn't her reputation would be ruined as no one could attest that she was still a virgin after being alone with a man. She tries to decline but Rasmus insists.

   According to Hanne and Joran, Rasmus began drinking when Fjerda started to lose the war and mocked Jarl Brum's tactics. He thought it amusing to slap Hanne in a situation similar to the one with Joran and the riding crop and demanded Hanne hit him back, which she did not. He told her that they would do this frequently when they were married, which was the breaking point for Joran. He tried to intervene, but Hanne used her

   Rasmus was cruel and sadistic. He enjoyed inflicting pain on others. The incident with Joran and the riding crop is a prime example of this. Rasmus was mocked his whole life for being weak and to spend endless hours in the company of Joran, who is a prime example of a Fjerdan man, must have felt like a cruel joke. When he was made to feel weak and inferior he took it out on Joran, who is silent and strong. He wanted to take out his frustrations, but he also wanted to see how far he could go before Joran showed emotion, asking him "Does it hurt?"

   However, Rasmus was also lonely, and enjoyed the company of Hanne and Nina, making jokes and complimenting their dresses.

   Rasmus is average height for a Fjerdan but eerily gaunt. He has shoulder long golden blonde hair, blue eyes, and high cheekbones. His complexion is almost green and he looks very sickly, as he has been ill since childhood.  As he becomes stronger, his complexion becomes rosier and his unsure posture becomes more confident.

   Rasmus's relationship with Hanne went off to a promising if slightly dramatic start as she saved his life very publicly when his health suddenly declined in the middle of the Heartwood ceremony. He invited her to have lunch with him multiple times and they danced together twice at the ball, Rasmus delighting in the fact that his health was good enough for him to do so, unknowing that Hanne was secretly healing him the whole time. He saw her as a potential wife and certainly seemed to develop some feelings for her, but in the end his selfishness and sick tendencies ruined any chance of a loving relationship. She inevitably killed him, tailored his body to hers and threw him out the window.

   Rasmus only knew Nina by her undercover name Mila Janderstat and doubtless if he knew who she really was he would not have invited her to lunch. He did not really care for her and when Joran claimed he attempted to sexually assault her to cover up a different situation, Rasmus was not at all bothered. Nina was only ever seen as an irritant and a barrier between him and Hanne.

   Joran was Rasmus's personal guard, though they did not get along. Rasmus despised him because he was everything Rasmus was not - strong, handsome, stoic - and because he had seen Rasmus at his worst, making him feel even more vulnerable. He states that Joran had even had to carry him upstairs on multiple accounts, something that Rasmus was incredibly bitter about. He frequently took his anger out on Joran and was infuriated that Joran refused to hit him back.
