   . Not long after his return, their home was surrounded by the King’s soldiers, demanding that the Darkling turn himself over. The Darkling did as instructed and gave himself up peacefully. However, the King's men had no intentions of bringing him in and shot the Darkling with arrows. Fortunately, Luda remained hidden inside, healing the Darkling as he was struck with each arrow. However, one of the soldiers managed to capture Luda and kill her. Enraged by her death, the Darkling used the Cut, killing nearly a dozen of the King’s men.

The Darkling reminded Baghra that she taught him how to kill, meaning their blood is on her hands as much as his own. She urged him to flee west to Kerch and wait for the King to die. Then he could return under a new identity and make peace with the new King. However, the Darkling refused to run while Grisha were in trouble. He sought to train them how to fight, but with so few of them actually knowing for to fight, the Darkling decided he would make a new army as Morozova did by forging new life to amplify their power using

He then helps Alina up and takes her the rest of the way to the Little Palace, during which time he explains that what Alina witnessed was a signature summoner move known as the Cut. Kirigan believes that the attempt on Alina’s life proves just how much their enemies fear her existence. Her light show in the Fold must’ve alerted them.

   he handpicked for her — black being his color. He takes Alina to a fountain and asks how she’s adjusting to life at the palace. Alina admits that she feels lonely, a sentiment the Darkling knows well enough. When he was a boy, he used to hide by the fountain once he realized he was the descendant to the Black Heretic, the creator of the Fold and the most hated Grisha in Ravka. He’d go to the fountain, throw a coin, and wish that he could be anyone else. Kirigan has devoted his life to undoing the sin of his ancestor, but he’s never seen as the solution, only the reminder of the problem. Alina is hopefully his solution, but she fears that if she fails to destroy the Fold that she will become the most hated Grisha in Ravka. Kirigan promises that he won’t allow that to happen and assures her they will change the world.

   General Kirigan meets with Mal after learning that he spotted the Stag north of Chernast, twice as big as any other, all white with enormous antlers marked by a symbol. When Kirigan asks for an exact location, Mal demands to see Alina first, insisting that they’re close friends. In exchange, he will give General Kirigan the location of the Stag. Despite already being aware of Mal’s relationship with Alina, Kirigan asks Mal to prove that he knows her by revealing something that only few would know about her, such as her favorite flower, which Mal reveals is blue iris. Assuming Mal is telling the truth, Kirigan promises to bring Alina to him.

   Zlatan

   General Kirigan requests for Zoya to join him at sun down when he leads a team in pursuit of the criminals that took Alina. Zoya questions if Alina may have left of her own free will, noting that Alina never fit in at the Palace. However, Kirigan could relate to her, as the King’s soldier treated him the same way because they knew he was more important than any of them. Zoya recalls how Kirigan used to call on her when his table was messy but his bed was neat. She’d help him make it the other way around. She seeks to rekindle what they once had, but General Kirigan is only interested in Alina.

Alina chooses Mal, allowing for General Kirigan to deliver the killing blow to the Stag, decapitating the creature with the Cut.

He heals Mal as promised and proposes that he and Alina join forces. Together, they can end all wars and protect the Grisha. Alina asks are they destroying the Fold. He replies they can do anything and then extends his hand to Alina. She takes his hand, and then David crafts the Stag’s antlers into a collar. The antlers infuse with Alina, with the sharp ends protruding from her shoulder blades and another piece of the antler being infused in Kirigan’s hand, thus bridging the gap between the two, allowing him to control her powers given that he killed the Stag.

Mal refers to him as the Black Heretic and promises to kill him the first chance he gets. Kirigan acknowledhes that Mal and Alina care greatly for one another judging by the letters Kirigan read between the two. Admittedly, Alina may take years to forgive him, but as Grisha, Kirigan can wait, whereas Mal will age and one day she will forget all about him and realize that she only has one equal, that being the Darkling. So he doesn’t need to kill Mal, as time will do it for him.

He declares that the Fold is his to control and tells the passengers to take what they’ve seen back to their home countries and spread the word, for there will be no more war with Ravka.
