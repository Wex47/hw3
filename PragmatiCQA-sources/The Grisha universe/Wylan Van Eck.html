   Although a gifted artist and musician, Wylan cannot read because he has severe dyslexia. When Wylan was around eight, his father realized Wylan couldn't read or write. At that time, Van Eck told Wylan
   his mother
   grew ill and died, then refused to let Wylan go to her funeral. Van Eck began to verbally abuse Wylan and estrange him from the household.
  </p>
  <p key="0fd6cc42-fc92-4834-bb6a-3ac3818e21e6">
   After Wylan's stepmother,
   Alys
   , became pregnant, Van Eck attempted to have Wylan killed in order to protect the repute of the Van Eck name and erase Wylan from public memory. His father told Wylan he was going to study music in
   Belendt
   , but instructed two of his guards to kill Wylan on the browboat as they left
   Ketterdam
   . After nearly being strangled, Wylan jumped out of the boat into the canal and eventually swam to shore.

   Wylan ended up in the Barrel, where he rented a room at a boarding house and hid for several days before venturing out to find work at a tannery, barely able to make enough money to scrape by. He began going by Wylan Hendriks, his mother's surname. A few weeks later,

   and
   Inej Ghafa
   asked him to make bombs for them, but Wylan refused. However, he returned to the boarding house to discover that his father had sent a letter, and decided to do demo work for the Dregs. Van Eck continued to send letters to Wylan to taunt him, knowing Wylan could not read them. Wylan never opened the letters.

   and scope out the prison wagon's path. Wylan uses a salt concentrate to uproot a tree to block the path of the wagon as a distraction while the six thieves take the place of some of the prisoners. In the Ice Court's prison, Wylan panics when the guards find Kaz's lockpicks, since he believes this ruins their plan to escape. Wylan expresses his fears to Jesper, and the two bicker nervously. Jesper knocks out the other prisoners with what Wylan recognizes as a pellet of chloro gas. Wylan is shocked and intrigued by Jesper's revelation of his Fabrikator power.

The incinerator seems impossible to climb, but Wylan finds Inej's Fabrikator-made slippers and Kaz's gloves in the laundry, allowing her to withstand the heat. When Inej reaches the roof, she sends a rope down for the others, and Wylan climbs to the top with Matthias. Kaz and Nina accidentally set off Yellow Protocol, so Wylan agrees with Jesper's suggestion to abandon the mission and leave while they still can. However, Inej and Kaz create a new plan that involves Wylan taking apart a ringwall gate and triggering Black Protocol, and the group splits up again.

Jesper weakens the links of the steel chain with his Fabrikator power and Wylan cuts at the metal with shears.

He also wins a bet with Kaz, who had not believed Van Eck would so callously end his son's life. Van Eck escapes with Inej and the money, and Jesper speaks with Wylan, angry that he was the only one left in the dark about Wylan's disguise. Wylan defends Jesper to Kaz. In the final chapter, Wylan accompanies Kaz, Jesper, Matthias, and Nina to

   Wylan also cultivates a stronger relationship with Jesper Fahey. In the beginning, he goes with Jesper to meet his father, something that he was especially scared about. Later, in return, Jesper agrees to go with Wylan to visit his mother's grave at Saint Hilde. However, upon reaching Saint Hilde, they discover that Wylan's mother was not dead at all, but locked in an asylum by Jan Van Eck due to the fact that she had birthed a child that could not read. Wylan cannot reveal himself to her as her own son, but he talks to her and finds out that she is suffering. On the way back, Wylan begins to cry and Jesper comforts him. The horrifying discovery about his mother motivates Wylan to go through with the job in order to get money from his father and free his mother, something they found out later that Kaz had planned all along.

   Wylan accompanies Kaz to his father's house on Geldstraat to steal the seal. Kaz offers Wylan some good advice but is interrupted by Pekka Rollins.

   Later, Jesper tells him that it was just a mistake; he had actually thought he was kissing Wylan. Wylan is stunned and then indignant and says that the two are nothing alike and that Kuwei isn't even that good at science. He also reveals that half of Kuwei's notebooks are full of drawings of Jesper. Wylan also says that Jesper can kiss whomever he likes. Jesper says that he does, as regularly as possible and Wylan says "so what's the problem?" Jesper then gives Wylan a painting of Wylan as a child of about eight years that he took from Saint Hildes. Jespers claims he stole it to help Wylan return to his 'old merchling self'. He offers to accompany Wylan to the baths to meet the
   Grisha Triumvirate
   and he gratefully accepts.

   Kaz, Wylan and Jesper meet with the Grisha Triumvirate in order to discuss the plan, and Wylan meets
   Genya Safin
   , the most talented

   in the world. She agrees to make him look like himself again, with the help of a painting of himself done by his mother that Jesper took from Saint Hilde. He reveals to her that he can't read, later confessing to Jesper that telling more people makes him feel better about himself. After several hours of tailoring, Wylan looks just as he did before, and he and Jesper spend some time alone. Wylan tries to get Jesper to embrace his power as a Fabrikator, something that he has always been taught to hate about himself. They've both had a similar experience. Wylan points out that maybe the reason why Jesper shoots so well is due to him using his powers, something that Jesper dismisses at first, saying that Wylan is cute but crazy, but it turns out to be important. Jesper is feeling mad and scattered and Wylan calms him down. He tells him to breathe and then leans forward and kisses Jesper, then Jesper says "Wylan, I really hope we don't die."

   Wylan is considerate, nice, and innocent, despite the fact that he is a part of the Dregs. He is the kindest out of the Dregs, and is very caring but calculated. His privileged status makes him unused to violence; however, he is still willing to do damage—even saying at one point, after Jesper says he doesn't kill sleeping men, that they can wake up two men before killing them. Wylan is also reasonably shy, often speaking and commenting only if he is asked to, although his character development proves that this is due to his father's treatment of him with him becoming more confident as he becomes more assured of his worth.

   Wylan also has a curious, contemplative mind, often questioning how things function such as on Jesper's pistols and the Ice Court's aqueduct system. He prefers music and numbers to words, as he cannot read or write because of his dyslexia. Wylan is insecure regarding his disability due to his father's rejection and hatred of him because of his inability to read or write.

   Wylan has ruddy gold curls, pale skin, and blue eyes. At sixteen, he is the youngest of the Crows, though he looks younger; Matthias Helvar believed his age to be twelve instead of sixteen. He resembles his father, Jan Van Eck, but has his mother's curls. Kaz Brekker said he "looked like a child—smooth-skinned, wide-eyed, like a silk-eared puppy in a room full of fighting dogs."

   , Jesper endlessly teases Wylan and often makes him blush. Wylan appears to have a crush on Jesper and by the end of the Ice Court heist, asks Jesper if he likes boys, too. While disguised as Kuwei on the return trip to Ketterdam, Wylan liked to watch Jesper; however, he could not talk to him without revealing he was not Kuwei. Wylan repeatedly defends Jesper to Kaz when the two have a falling out.

   , Wylan and Jesper bond over similar experiences and try to teach each other to love themselves for who they are and despite their struggles. They became romantically involved after they kissed towards the end of the book. But before they kiss, Jesper accidentally kisses Kuwei, because at the time Wylan and Kuwei looked identical. Jesper ends up helping run the Van Eck business after Wylan's father gets sent to prison. Jesper reads papers for Wylan since Wylan is dyslexic. They live together in the Van Eck residence.
