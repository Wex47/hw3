  </h2>
  <p key="a876af12-a53b-4113-8833-3e6878f3244e">
   Born Kaz Rietveld, he was raised on a farm near
   Lij
   with his father and older brother
   Jordie Rietveld
   . When Kaz was nine, their father died in a plough accident. Jordie sold the farm and took Kaz to Ketterdam, where he intended for Kaz to attend school. Several days after their arrival in the city, Kaz and Jordie went to the East Stave to watch street magicians and met a boy named
   Filip
   selling wind-up dogs. Filip introduced Jordie to a minor mercher called
   Jakob Hertzoon
   , who employed them as runners while Kaz remained at Hertzoon's coffeehouse, practicing magic tricks. Kaz also met Hertzoon's wife

   Saskia
   , who gave him her red ribbon.
  </p>
  <p key="1529e797-5220-4f7a-84a3-616becbd51da">
   Hertzoon encouraged the boys to invest in sugar stocks, resulting in a large payout. A few days later, he had Jordie invest heavily in the
   <i key="107baf0b-664d-4b2e-9021-dd5a20f8b634">
    jurda
   </i>
   crop, using all of the funds from the sale of their father's farm. Kaz and Jordie spent the next week in comfort, but when it was time to reconvene at the coffeehouse, they found it empty. They realized that Jakob Hertzoon and his "family" had been running a con, taking all their money and leaving them penniless.
   The boys were evicted from their boarding house and forced to sleep on the streets, coming into conflict with the
   <i key="ab0c7690-d24b-4f32-b9bc-86e05b08f6dc">

   and the
   Razorgulls
   .
  </p>
  <p key="0f749d65-1918-4ce9-997f-3b2d80d0765a">
   When the
   Queen's Lady Plague
   swept through the city, Jordie developed a fever from the
   firepox
   and Kaz followed two days later. Presumed dead, the brothers were ferried onto a sickboat to the
   Reaper's Barge
   at sea. Though Jordie had died, Kaz survived the firepox. Barely alive and too weak to swim on his own, Kaz used his brother's body as a float to swim back to Ketterdam's harbor, vowing to take vengeance on Hertzoon.
   The experience left Kaz unable to bear contact with another person's skin, and after a severe panic attack Kaz purchased a pair of gloves, never removing them except in private.
  </p>
  <p key="f181d4ae-a3fe-4f8b-9a6f-8aba8bea31b8">
   Kaz adopted the surname Brekker, cutting ties with the Rietveld identity and remaking himself as a ruthless fighter. He worked at gambling dens on East Stave, learned to steal, was sent to jail twice, was courted by numerous gangs in
   the Barrel
   , and earned the nickname "Dirtyhands". He was soon banned from playing in any gambling hall on the Stave thanks to his gift for cards. He saw Jakob Hertzoon for the first time since the con, only to learn that Hertzoon was really Pekka Rollins, leader of the
   Dime Lions
   . The next day, Kaz joined
   the Dregs
   .
  </p>
  <p key="5d0af304-4c9a-4e46-9757-cf40e18a5299">
   He began as a grunt, but quickly rose through the ranks, becoming an official member at age twelve
   and a lieutenant several years later, known for his precise ruthlessness as Dirtyhands. At age fourteen, Kaz was caught when the
   <i key="845afee1-4a17-4200-af4f-0c6f57b0533b">
    stadwatch
   </i>
   rousted a gambling hall, resulting in his sixth and final arrest.
   While working at the spring prize fights for the gang, Kaz met
   Imogen
   and developed a crush on her, though he was unable to overcome his touch aversion and pursue a relationship.
   The same year, Kaz put together a crew to rob the bank that had helped Hertzoon con him and Jordie, but broke his leg dropping down from the bank rooftop.
  </p>
  <p key="1c06dbfc-c4cb-4f24-99d7-0c35f06ae0bf">
   The Dregs' power and reputation grew thanks to Kaz. He helped the
   Crow Club
   , one of the main sources of income for the Dregs, grow profitably,
   with Kaz as the floor boss for more than two years.
   Fifth Harbor
   had been useless and abandoned by the city before Kaz developed it, mortgaging the Crow Club to provide the funds. Thanks to the success of Fifth Harbor, the Dregs became a major gang in Ketterdam.
   Kaz recruited numerous young people into the gang, members who were loyal to him and viewed him as the true leader of the Dregs rather than
   Per Haskell
   .

   When Jesper and Wylan go to meet with

Kaz helps Jesper construct a lie to his father to explain his situation in Ketterdam, using some of Kaz's own experience being swindled. Kaz begins to form a plan to use Colm in his scheme to discredit Van Eck, to Jesper's frustration, but reveals no details to his crew and reserves a room at the Geldrenner Hotel for Colm.

   House of the White Rose

   Kaz's plan goes wrong, and the group reconvenes with Jesper's father. Their plight seems hopeless, as the entire city is out looking for them, and even Kaz's gang, the Dregs, have turned on them. Kaz decides that he will stage an auction with Kuwei Yul-Bo as the "prize", in the hope of using the money to fund his team's own plans for the future. He also has a scene where he reveals his true feelings for Inej - almost kissing her neck before his panic takes hold. He then reveals that he has paid off her
   indenture
   himself, selling every asset he owns to set her free. Kaz breaks into the Dregs' stronghold and stages an impromptu single-handed coup, fighting off at least ten of the members loyal to Per Haskell, and overthrowing the old man. Then he sets up Colm Fahey as "Johannes Rietveld", an alias using his and Jordie's old name, to swindle money from the
   Merchant Council
   and Jan Van Eck. He meets with the
   Grisha Triumvirate
   and strikes a deal with
   Sturmhond

   Council of Tides
   shows up to declare the auction a sham. It also seems that Kaz has been betrayed by Wylan Van Eck, who was captured by his own father just before the auction. However, Kaz has been two or three steps ahead the whole time and he slowly reveals his plot to discredit Jan Van Eck and steal the thirty million

   Kaz is cold-hearted, ruthless, and well-known for being willing to do any job, no matter the danger or violence involved, so as long as it will make him a good deal of money. This trait and his various egregious actions have earned him the nickname "Dirtyhands", a reputation he draws upon to intimidate his opponents. Kaz is manipulative and conniving and makes sure to always be the person in control of the situation. For this reason, he's quick-witted and always has a trick up his sleeve. He discourages trust and is willing to exploit almost anyone for his own gain.
  </p>
  <p key="180fd6de-f053-4cd4-8d5e-c1a41fda08d2">
   Kaz usually appears calm and collected, rarely allowing his emotions or true thoughts to show. However, he holds a penchant for wrathful revenge, particularly when he is wronged or Inej is hurt. He vowed to avenge his deceased brother and lives by the motto "brick by brick" to take down his enemies. Kaz turned the tragedy and trauma of his childhood into a fearsome reputation, and he actively encourages rumors about his ruthlessness and lack of humanity.
  </p>
  <p key="5fad3512-11b3-4d4a-a332-ecb94d440bfa">
   He has extreme difficulty expressing his emotions, even to those close to him, thanks to his PTSD. It takes him a great deal of time and effort to realize and admit his genuine feelings for Inej. Kaz struggles to come to terms with being both Dirtyhands, who can do what needs to be done, and Kaz Rietveld, who can love Inej.
  </p>
  <p key="1b52dafe-0134-4441-abf5-1dbc5dca5d2d">
   Kaz also suffers from haphephobia, the fear of being touched or touching others. This developed from his traumatic experiences as a child, when he was thought to be dead and dumped with hundreds of dead plague victims. Kaz was forced to swim to shore, using his deceased brother as a float to keep him from drowning. He suffers from PTSD involving vivid flashbacks whenever he makes skin-to-skin contact with anyone else. This severe phobia also comes up when he’s in small spaces with other people: in

   Kaz has pale skin and dark hair trimmed short on the sides. According to Inej, his eyes are the color of bitter coffee or strong tea in sunlight. He has a sharp jawline, a narrow face, and a lean, muscular build. On his right arm, Kaz has two tattoos: the Dregs' crow and cup on his forearm, and on his bicep a black

   Kaz wears simple, dark suits tailored to fit him, and a black hat – the outfit of a Ketterdam merchant. He wears merchant clothing to mock respectable businessmen by looking like one of them, rather than wearing the bright flash preferred by most Barrel gang members. Due to his haphephobia, Kaz always wears black leather gloves with small slits in the fingers to allow for better card handling and lockpicking.

  <p key="ce90183d-c69c-434e-801b-e743168779c7">
   Kaz has a limp and uses a cane with a crow's head as its handle, which also doubles as a weapon. His limp is due to jumping off a roof of a bank at fourteen, breaking his right leg, an injury that never fully healed properly. The severity of his limp varies, depending on factors such as cold weather and stress.
   Genya Safin
   offered to heal his leg, but Kaz refused. When asked by Inej what Kaz's tell is in a fight, he claims that his opponents never look past his limp, giving Kaz the element of surprise on his side.

   In combat, Kaz favors his crow's head cane, which he adeptly uses to shatter bones and bring down opponents. He is also comfortable with using knives and guns. When unarmed, he is still dangerous, capable of holding his own with his fists or using improvised objects as weapons.

   Inej and Kaz worked together in the Dregs for nearly two years before the Ice Court job and are each the person that the other trusts most. After several near-death encounters, they gradually acknowledge their feelings for one another, inching closer and closer to a romantic relationship. However, the trauma of their pasts makes an intimate relationship extremely difficult. Still, Kaz makes particular effort to prevent harm coming to Inej and to do right by her, even if he believes she deserves better than him.
  </p>
  <p key="d370dcf2-3d27-4cb0-a0d9-161f6d40e4fb">
   Kaz originally rescued Inej from
   Tante Heleen
   's
   Menagerie
   , transferring her indenture to the Dregs instead. He gives her knives and teaches her to fight and pick locks, and also gives her the name "Wraith". Kaz quickly grows to trust Inej more than anyone else; even willingly removing his gloves in her presence. Kaz slowly realizes his romantic feelings for Inej but tries to suppress them, viewing them as a weakness or a liability for both himself and Inej. Inej is also the one to pull Kaz out of his panic attacks. When Kaz almost drowns escaping the Ice Court, he realizes he needs to tell Inej his feelings; however, Inej only wants a relationship with Kaz if he can face the demons of his past and be honest with himself and her.
  </p>
  <p key="3db5e1ad-3138-4a0b-b82e-87a848b1df1b">
   Kaz often tries to convince himself, Inej, and everyone else that his interest in Inej is purely economical,
   which upsets both him and Inej.
   After rescuing her from Van Eck, Kaz confesses that he would still come for Inej if she couldn't be the Wraith anymore, finally admitting she is more to him than an investment. Whenever Inej is injured, Kaz becomes irrational and fears for her safety,
   and tries to take precautions to protect her.
  </p>
  <p key="1ed4451b-f786-4f72-bbe1-2062af6ce2d7">
   Before Inej departs Ketterdam, Kaz removes his gloves in public and successfully holds her hand for an extended period of time. He also reveals to her that he bought her a ship to hunt slavers and also negotiated with King
   Nikolai Lantsov
   to find her parents and bring them to Ketterdam. Beside herself with joy, Inej invites Kaz to come to meet them with her. He then asks her to check if his tie is straight before going to see them.

    Kaz could have told Jesper that he knew he wasn't dirty, reminded him that he'd trusted him enough to make him his only real second in a fight that could have gone badly wrong tonight. Instead, he said, 'Go on, Jesper. There's a line of credit waiting for you at the Crow Club. Play till morning or your luck runs out, whichever comes first.

   After Inej, Jesper is the second closest person to Kaz. Kaz shares with Jesper more details about his schemes than he does with most members of the Dregs (although not as much as he tells Inej and never the full details). However, Kaz's trust is shattered when he learns Jesper's indiscretion led to Pekka Rollins ambushing them at the harbor. As punishment, Kaz hides key details of his plan, including disguising Wylan as Kuwei, from the sharpshooter. Jesper spends most of

  <p key="69369559-e40e-4f73-afb8-3fcec68d369c">
   Jesper also has a strong attraction to Kaz initially,
   longs for Kaz to trust him more, and is jealous of Inej's position in Kaz's close confidence. However, Kaz never reciprocates these feelings. Kaz comes to regard Jesper as a brother, even calling him by the name of his dead brother, Jordie.
   Jesper's recklessness and optimism remind Kaz of Jordie, and Kaz does not want to lose Jesper too.

  <p key="2a810732-731b-4fa4-a553-de2ca5f456d9">
   Jesper is often upset with Kaz's callous treatment of others, such as Wylan and Jesper's father, occasionally leading to physical altercations between the two. Jesper is usually unafraid to question Kaz's judgment and plans, though Kaz knows Jesper will defer to him in the end.
