When Mal was drafted to board the skiff to go through the Fold, Alina burned maps of West Rahman areas, so she could go with him through the Fold. After she was discovered as the Sun Summoner and taken to the Little Palace, she would frequently write to Mal, but never received a response. With her separation from Mal, not hearing a word from him, Alina started to suspect that her feelings towards him were unrequited and she soon gave up the idea of being reunited with him.

   However, after she escaped the Little Palace, Mal was able to track her, reuniting the two friends. Once they were able to find a safe place to rest, the two finally spoke, both confirming that neither of them was receiving their letters and the two made up. When Mal was injured, protecting Alina from the Darkling's forces, Alina accepted the Darkling's deal to lower her defenses, allowing the General to kill Morozova's Stag, in exchange for having Mal's injuries healed. Mal was still kept prisoner, forcing Alina's cooperation to the Darkling's plans. After the Darkling was defeated in the Fold, Alina and Mal boarded a ship, together, to cross the True Sea.

   Alina first met the Darkling when she was brought to his tent, following her display of summoning light in the Fold. She found him very intimidating and was unsettled after he used the Cut to kill her would-be assassin. He was constantly encouraging her, exclaiming her importance to Ravka and destroying the Fold. She started developing romantic feelings for him, as he began to show her his more vulnerable side, with his frustration in the war and his desire to protect all Grisha. Letting go of the idea of any reunion with Mal, Alina became closer to the general, and on the day of the Winter Fete, she kissed him, catching him off guard but he was not displeased. Later that night, the two shared a more passionate kiss but were interrupted.

   Upon learning from Baghra that the Darkling was the Black Heretic, who created the Fold, Alina felt betrayed, believing all his words of support and displays of vulnerability were lies and she fled the Little Palace. After Alina and Mal are taken prisoner, the general tries to reason with Alina that together they could do great things. However, he has David fuse the Morozova's Stag antlers to her bones, and a piece of the antler to the Darkling's hand, allowing him control of her light. Before they went into the Fold again, he tried to reason with her, but with all he had done, she no longer trusted his good intentions and was horrified when he used the Fold to consume Novokribirsk, as he claimed retribution for the attacks on Alina and other Grisha. She finally was able to break free of his control, cutting out the stag's bone from his hand, and believed him dead in the Fold after escaping it.

   The morning after Alina arrived at the Little Palace, she met the Tailor, Genya, who arrived with a few maids to help prepare Alina to be presented to the king. After a maid suggested that they make Alina look less Shu, Genya dismissed them and apologized to Alina for their comments. Alina asked her not to change her, and Genya assured Alina that she did not care that Alina was part Shu. Genya proceeded to tailor Alina, telling Alina that she had been a Tailor for years and was gifted to the queen by General Kirigan. During Alina's time at the Little Palace, Alina would frequently ask Genya if Mal had written to her, which Genya would always claim that he did not. During the day of the Winter Fete, Alina told Genya that she no longer needed to be informed if Mal wrote to her, and that she would begin wearing black

   instead of blue, like General Kirigan. Genya was happy that Alina was feeling much better than when she arrived at the Little Palace, but advised Alina to be careful of powerful men. Alina was introduced to the Durast, David, and Alina could see, immediately, that Genya had feelings for him, by the way the Tailor acted in front of him and complimenting his work to his face. Something Genya would usually never do. The two snuck out to the palace grounds to watch the performances, though Genya was concerned Alina might be recognized as the Sun Summoner.

   , and remember that the Darkling gifted Genya to the queen, Alina realized Genya was conspiring with him. Alina was furious with Genya, now knowing it was her who stole her letters to Mal, and was the only one close enough to poison the king. Genya opened up to Alina, that for years she was a victim of the king and that her actions were retribution for his crimes against her. Alina was more sympathetic to Genya's plight, but told her that the Darkling did not deserve her loyalty as he was also responsible for her position, and told her that all Grisha are just his pawns. Genya stormed out of the tent. Genya left Alina, still the Darkling's prisoner.
