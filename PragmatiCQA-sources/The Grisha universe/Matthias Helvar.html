    Matthias Helvar was a soldier and a hero. He saved me from drowning. He kept us both alive on the ice. He endured a year in the worst prison in the world for a crime he didn't commit. He forgave me for betraying him. He fought beside me, and when he could have abandoned me, he turned his back on the only country he'd ever known instead. For that, he was branded a traitor. But he wasn't. He believed his country could be more than it had been. He lived with honor and died with it too. He wasn't always a good man, but he had a good heart. A great, strong heart that should have kept beating for years and years.

   A year in confinement at the inhumane penitentiary
   Hellgate
   made Matthias cold, brutal, hateful, and unforgiving, all needed for him to survive in the brutal atmosphere of the prison. Matthias spent his year in prison dreaming about the girl he had begun to love, imagining being with her lovingly and taking his revenge all the same. After escaping, Matthias was angry at being made to betray his country again and did not get along with the rest of the crew. Over the course of the Ice Court heist and the return trip to Ketterdam, Matthias becomes more at ease among the Crows, though still standoffish to new people.

   Matthias is quick to anger and prioritizes protecting the friends he'd made in the Crows over being nice. He shows a soft spot for Nina and worries extensively about her. Matthias has good intuition and is able to deduce truths about the emotions of Kaz, Nina, and Jesper that most people do not recognize.

   When a storm wrecks the ship, Nina uses the broken mug handle to get out of her cage, which saved her life.
