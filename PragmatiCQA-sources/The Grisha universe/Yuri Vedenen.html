   Yuri read as many books as he could borrow since he was a young boy, which worried his parents in that he would not gain money for them. Sometime later, they sent him to live with his uncle in
   <a href="Novokribirsk.html" key="23dfbfb4-4ca3-49d2-bbee-01faa38d3f8b" title="Novokribirsk">

   to work on the dry docks for
   sandskiffs
   . When not working, he often read in the nearby church and lost himself to the texts. Many of the men who worked on the ports mocked Yuri for his wheezing and his fogged-up glasses, and his uncle physically abused him and mocked him for not working as well as others. Tired of this, Yuri prayed to the gods to free him from his uncle and others' cruelty and devote his life to study.
  </p>
  <p key="0f16e609-6e90-4e4d-8723-43bd86a13e0d">
   One day, having drifted to sleep while reading in the church, he awoke to shadows moving around his feet. He ran back to his uncle's house, who beat him mercilessly for not putting dinner on the table on time. He was unable to rise from bed the next day from the pain, making his uncle promise to beat him if he did not come to work on the docks. Yuri forced himself to get up, eat breakfast, and leave for work. Making it to the town square, he laid by the fountain when a voice told him not to go to the docks. He tried to go still, knowing he was weak enough to where his uncle would kill him with a second beating, but the voice told him to not go.

They asked Nikolai to complete the ritual to excise the demon and destroy the last of the Darkling's power, the act of which will finally free them from the Fold and allow them to live out mortal lives.

   When Nikolai finally undergoes the ritual, Lizabeta betrays him, revealing that she had secretly saved the Darkling's body from its funeral pyre and intends not to destroy him, but to bring him back to life. Yuri had been secretly helping Lizabeta as she had saved the Darkling's body and was planning to bring him back to life. Yuri deliberately betrayed Nikolai. However, Zoya was able to destroy the Darkling's body, kill Lizabeta with her own thorns, and save Nikolai. Having lost all track of time, they head back to the capital with Yuri in bonds.

   Despite his resurrection, the Darkling did not manage to bring his powers with him, nor could he be rid of Yuri—the boy was still present, sharing body and mind with the Darkling. The Darkling, in Yuri's body, was kept captive at the old zoo at the palace, where Sun Summoners kept watch over him. After some time, Zoya and Nikolai went to see him in hopes of finding information on where to find thorn wood, a supposedly extinct key ingredient for them to attempt the

Yuri tried to warn them, in a rare moment in which he was able to take hold of his body again completely. However, he lost hold and the Darkling drove a piece of thorn wood he had kept hidden in his clothes through Mal and Alina's hands. He needed the blood of the person who had killed him and a person who was related to him by blood in order to gain his powers back. He then managed to escape Zoya and the Sun Summoners.

   could not stop the blight. The Shadow Fold was a tear in the fabric of the universe, also known as "the making at the heart of the world". Before the making, there was nothing, only void; that void was seeping into the world through the tear, known to them as the blight.
  </p>
  <p key="843d7d93-b828-4306-a7d7-b1d0585adf6b">
   There was no way to close the tear. Someone had to hold it closed standing at the doorway between the void and creation for eternity. The member of the Order explained that the person doing this would suffer so much that death would be kindness. With this information, Nikolai and Zoya debated who should sacrifice themselves until the Darkling volunteered himself, saying he was the only one who was truly immortal and more powerful than Zoya. The only thing he asked of them was that they built him an altar so that he could be remembered in the books as a saint, the Starless One.

   They agreed, and the Darkling's heart was pierced by the thorn, his screaming body was swallowed by the thorn wood tree. Yuri was still alive, but powerless inside his body, now trapped with the Darkling standing between the void and creation.
