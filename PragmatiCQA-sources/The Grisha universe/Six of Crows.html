From the rooftop terrace of an old tavern in the city, they can see the road to the Ice Court and watch prison wagons go to the castle complex. Kaz says their way in is as prisoners in one such wagon. They fell a tree to block the road ahead of a wagon. They quickly switch places with the prisoners in the wagon, assuming their shackles and hoods, while the drivers try to remove the tree from their path. Kaz faints, but they make it through the checkpoints and into the Ice Court. The male and female prisoners are sent to separate parts of the castle prison, dividing the group for a time. They will time their movements to the chimes of the Elderclock.

   The incinerator was used in the afternoon instead of in the morning as Matthias had remembered. It is still burning hot when Inej scales the inside of it, melting her shoes. She almost gives up, but rain begins to fall, cooling her and allowing her to make it to the top. She drops the rope down and everyone climbs up except Jesper, who is waiting for Kaz. Kaz is late reuniting with the group because was searching for Pekka Rollins. He believed Pekka was also in pursuit of Yul-Bayur, which was confirmed when they saw Pekka's men dead on pikes outside the Ice Court. Kaz wants to see if Pekka had captured, wondering if it is finally time for his long-awaited revenge; Kaz does find him in a cell. Just as Jesper begins to climb up the incinerator shaft, Kaz appears, covered in blood.

Nina hastily gives herself and Inej the peacock tattoo with which all Menagerie girls are marked.  Nina flirts her way through the checkpoint onto the White Island, but the guard thinks Inej's tattoo over the scar of her old one looks suspicious and sends her to another line for people who need a second check. Nina proceeds on her own.

They attack the guards, dress in their uniforms, and hurry to the gate. Their mission is to cut the rope on the winch controlling the gate, but instead of the expected strong rope, the winch holds a metal chain. Wylan saws at the chain with shears while Jesper uses his Fabrikator power to weaken the links.

   Nina reaches the palace and is relieved to see Kaz and Matthias have made it, too. She sidesteps the Fjerdan men who hit on her, trying to find a high ranking official who will know where Yul-Bayur is being held and who is tipsy enough to tell her.

Kaz thought they could save Nina and at the same time use Brum to get Yul-Bayur. Matthias drags Brum into a cell, takes the key from around his neck, and locks the door behind him.

   But Kaz has a trick up his sleeve, too. Kuwei is not on Vellgeluk with them; rather, it is Wylan
   tailored
   to look like Yul-Bayur's son. Van Eck insists they tell him where the real Kuwei Yul-Bo is, but Kaz says only if he lets them safely off the island with their money. Van Eck gives the order to kill everyone except Kaz. He then sees Kaz glance at Inej for just a second, and realizes she is Kaz's weakness. His flying Squallers capture Inej, Van Eck's men grab the money, and they escape the island with Inej in tow. He announces they have one week to bring him the real Kuwei or Inej will be tortured.

   Jesper is furious that Kaz did not tell him about Wylan's transformation and confused by Wylan's willingness to follow through with it. Kaz is furious that Jesper let Pekka Rollins learn about their heist plans before they left town. Jesper did not realize his mistake, and Kaz kept his plan for Wylan secret from Jesper as punishment. Stuck on Vellgeluk with no Inej and no money, Kaz begins to create a new scheme to target Van Eck.

Kaz says not yet, and Pekka can see the hatred in his eyes for just a second. Pekka watches the crew leave his casino, and once they are out the door he realizes that he is missing everything valuable that was on his person: his pocket watch, his wallet, his tie pin, his coin pendant, and the gold buckles on his shoes. Pekka hopes Van Eck kills Kaz.

   When Inej was fourteen, she was kidnapped by slavers and brought to Kerch, where she was sold to
   the Menagerie
   (also called The House of Exotics), a brothel owned by
   Tante Heleen

She unknowingly signed a contract written in Kerch for her service at the Menagerie, and at the time, Inej only spoke Suli. She was rescued from the contract by Kaz Brekker, who came to the Menagerie and paid off her "debts" to Tante Heleen. He trained her to kill, pick locks, and build a reputation for her new moniker, the "Wraith".
