He then gets attacked but the two are able to work together to kill the creature. Mal is badly wounded, however, and Alina is scared that he is going to die. As she closes her eyes and is ready to die in another attack, a sudden light appears and she falls to the ground, hitting her head and falling unconscious.

   When Alina wakes up, she is still on the deck, but she has a gun pointed at her. Everyone is looking at her warily, and no one seems to want to touch her even when she stumbles as the skiff moves. It turns out that they are docking back in Kribirsk and the soldiers march Alina off the boat and up the road. She is eventually led to the Grisha pavilion and taken to the Darkling. It turns out that the source of light had been Alina, and, after a test from the Darkling, Alina is revealed to be a Sun Summoner. The Darkling then orders that she be taken to his coach and seen to by a Healer.

   During the attack from the Fjerdan, Alina runs away into a forest but is pursued by an attacker. As he is about to harm her, the Darkling rides up with enforcement and uses his mysterious shadow powers to attack the assassins. As he blinds them, his soldiers cut down the blinded men. Alina is still being held down though, and her attacker threatens to kill her but, as his knife strikes down, the Darkling kills him quickly by slicing him in half with the darkness. A few days after the attack, the Darkling sits with Alina after they make camp to answer some questions. Alina learns that his great-great-great-grandfather was the Black Heretic who accidentally created the Shadow Fold, and every Darkling since his time has tried to fix the mistake. The Darkling believes that Alina could be the person to help him do so.

After some bickering among the Grisha about who Alina should walk in with, the Darkling interrupts and states that she will walk in with him.

   After getting introduced to the King, Alina is asked to demonstrate her power again which she does with some help from the Darkling, and the King is sufficiently pleased. As he walks away with the Darkling, Alina gets swarmed by members of the court until Genya comes by to bring her to the Queen who wants to meet her. After they leave the room, the Darkling comes by again to tell her that the King was pleased with the display. He then tells Genya to get Alina fitted for her

While the servant agrees, she also tells Alina to be careful because the other Grisha would not approve of Genya eating with her. After dinner, Genya leaves and Alina gets ready for bed, but the only thing she can think of when she falls asleep is Mal. When Alina wakes up, she gets dressed for the day and her new

   In the Infirmary, Alina later hears from Marie and Nadia that Zoya got in trouble with Botkin and with the Darkling, and someone claimed to have seen her come crying from the Darkling's rooms. Marie and Nadia explain to Alina that Zoya hates her because she is jealous that the Darkling favors her for being a Sun Summoner. While in the Infirmary, Alina is visited by

   The next day, Alina asks Genya to check on Mal's status on the casualty lists and then goes to Baghra's hut where the Darkling is arguing with the teacher. Apparently, he wants to get Alina an amplifier, but Baghra is against it. The Darkling's men have reported sightings of a stag from

   Later, Alina finds out from Genya that Mal has been stationed in Tsibeya and is alive, but this does not make her feel any better that he has not returned any of her letters. A fight with Baghra afterward makes her realize that Mal is the only person she has in the world ever since they both lost their parents and were sent to the orphanage. Ever since she suppressed her powers during the Grisha examination, she had dark bags under her eyes, and she cannot summon her powers because a part of her still wants to go home to Mal. After this realization, she decides to accept her powers and the light finally comes easily to her without Baghra's help.
  </p>
  <p key="a08ef7c9-494b-4fbb-a46f-e6b5abc9c274">
   Once she accepts her powers, Alina's life is much easier. She can summon the light, isn't as tired all the time, and finally has an appetite again. She is even able to finally keep up in all of Botkin's classes and can use the glasses that the Fabrikators gave to her so long ago. One day, Botkin gifts her with a knife encased in a steel and leather sheath and says that she earned the Grisha steel.

   After a night of practicing with Baghra, the Darkling appears again. He walks with Alina back to the Little Palace and asks that she trust that he can find the stag. When she asks why he would care what she thinks, he says he does not know and then kisses her, and they are both surprised but have no time to react when Ivan suddenly interrupts them.

   With the King and Queen's fete coming up, the Grisha Summoners are expected to put on a performance and everyone is practicing, but Alina can only think of the Darkling and how she has not seen him in a while. On the night of the fete, Genya is helping Alina to get ready when the latter's

   When Alina arrives at the ballroom with her friends, she coincidentally runs into Duke Keramsov who does not remember her at all, but the chance meeting, unfortunately, reminds her of Mal. When Genya finds her, she is sad, but she still has to perform with the rest of the Grisha. The Darkling appears right before their turn, and they combine powers to create a light and shadow show for the crowd. As soon as the show is over, the Darkling leads Alina to another room where he starts to kiss her. When a drunken group interrupts the moment, the two separate with the Darkling heading to Ivan and the others in the war room while Alina goes back to the ballroom, but on the way she happens to see Mal.

   It turns out that Mal's group was the one to find the stag from Morozova's herd. When it doesn't seem like he is very happy to see her, Alina mentions that she did not get any response from her letters to him and Mal replies that he never received any letters. As the conversation continues, the two start fighting with Mal accusing Alina of enjoying the Darkling's attention too much. The fight ends with Mal leaving and Alina crying.

   When Alina is back in her room, she suddenly receives a visit from Baghra who drags her away and tells her that she must leave. Baghra tells her that the Darkling is planning on using the Shadow Fold as a weapon by expanding it. Whoever does not bow to him will see the Fold take over the land and destroy everything that it touches. When Alina does not seem to believe her, Baghra reveals that the Darkling is the Black Heretic, the one who created the Shadow Fold, and she is his mother. He has faked his death many times and has been waiting for the Sun Summoner in order to take control of the Fold.

   The Darkling needs Alina because the volcra in the Fold are vulnerable to sunlight. Once they are subdued, he can enter the Fold and be even more powerful than he is now. After Baghra explains that he needs the stag's antlers to control Alina, she finally realizes that the old woman is telling the truth. When she asks what needs to be done, Baghra tells her that she needs to head to West Ravka, which means she needs to cross the Fold.

One night, she gets accosted by a drunk man and has to use her sunlight to protect herself, but it draws the attention of a soldier who is dressed in the charcoal uniform that the Darkling's guard wears. She runs away before he can grab her but is chased and falls into a stream.

   When she thinks that she is safe, she hears something and it turns out that Mal has tracked her down. Instead of giving her away to the other soldiers, he leads her to safety and she learns that they have not found the stag yet. After a night of rest, she explains to Mal why she ran away and why the Darkling wants the stag so badly. Later, Mal announces that he is taking her North to Tsibeya. If they can get to the stag before the Darkling, Alina can claim the antlers for herself and become powerful enough to fight him.

   After some more traveling, Mal and Alina finally reach a village on the northwest side of the Petrazoi and are unnerved by how empty the houses they passed are. It turns out that it is butter week. A week before the spring fast, every nobleman is expected to ride out in a cart filled with "sweets and cheeses and baked breads" to pass out to villagers, and it is a happy celebration for everyone. While in town during the festival, Mal and Alina are accosted by some muggers who rob them. When the thieves tell Mal to open his bag, they see his military-issued rifle and they are immediately suspicious. A fight soon breaks out and Alina has to use her powers so they can escape, but they luckily only lose Mal's rifle and wool blanket.

   In the end, the fight ends the tension that had existed between Alina and Mal and, while not everything is back to normal, the two are friends again. Now as they travel further north, they talk about Alina's life at the Little Palace. One night, Alina asks that Mal not let the Darkling's men take her if they get caught. Essentially, she is asking that Mal kill her before letting that happen. Met with his refusal, Alina pushes the subject until Mal ultimately promises to take her life if need be.

   When they think that they have finally found the stag, Mal and Alina set up camp for the night, and Mal reveals that Mikhael and Dubrov were both killed in Fjerda while tracking the stag. Mal had volunteered to go look and the two volunteered to go with him. Nine soldiers crossed the Fjerdan border for the stag, only two returned. The next day, Mal finally admits his feelings for Alina and they kiss. Not too long after, does and the stag from Morozova's herd enter the clearing.

   As Mal is ready to kill the stag, Alina tells him to wait and walks over to the stag that is staring at her. She knows she cannot kill it. The Darkling arrives in the clearing and does not hesitate as one of his soldiers fires an arrow at the stag. When he goes to kill the stag, Alina covers the stag's body with her own. Knowing that she won't give up without a fight, the Darkling uses his darkness to cover the area and they struggle with each other, but Alina is not as strong and is about to fall. She tells Mal to kill her but he cannot do it. The Darkling overpowers her and Mal easily.

When she begs for Mal's life, the Darkling seems to be merciful enough to let her see him, but then he reveals that he plans on bringing Mal into the fold with them and feeding him to the volcra. Ivan takes Alina to see Mal, and the two spend the night reminiscing about their childhood and their time together after the orphanage. When morning comes, Alina is taken away to get ready for crossing the Fold.

   It turns out that the Darkling had gathered ambassadors from Fjerda, Shu Han, and Kerch to see her powers. As they enter the Fold, the Darkling uses Alina's powers as soon as the volcra get close to their ship, and she easily drives the creatures away with the power from the stag's antlers. Minutes pass and they are already almost through the Fold, and Alina can see the other side of the Shadow Fold. As soon as the boat is about to dock, the Darkling uses his powers to combine with the Shadow Fold and makes the Fold spread, and the volcra quickly attack the innocent villagers.

While he killed it, she had spared its life. She feels back in control over her powers and immediately uses the light to save Mal, and the Darkling, angry, commands his soldiers to attack her. When the Grisha come towards her, Alina demonstrates her new strength by using the Cut, a powerful technique that only the Darkling uses, to split the skiff's mast in two.
