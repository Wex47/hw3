   In Os Alta, he and Alina begin to grow apart. He is concerned about her wanting too much power, as well as Nikolai's advances and intentions with Alina. Additionally, he is not happy in Os Alta, as he feels he has no true use other than being an amusement for the nobility, who use him for his tracking and are entertained by stories of his military days. He wants her to run away from this new life so that they can go back to their old lives, but Alina recognizes her responsibility to fight and protect her country - as well as her own lust for power - and declines. Due to their differences in priorities, they break up, and he later spends much of his time either drinking or joining a Grisha fight club in an attempt to reclaim his sense of self-agency. During one of these fights, Alina catches Zoya (Alina's then-rival) kissing Mal, which he reciprocates, which leads to Alina breaking down and crying and another fight between them.

   The Darkling attacks Os Alta, and corners Alina, Mal, and the surviving Grisha in the chapel. Alina tells them all to run and goes to the Darkling; tricking him into letting her get close enough to kiss him, Alina uses his powers to bring down the chapel, and ultimately the both of them. She tries to end the chaos with the Darkling once and for all, rather than submitting and letting him win. She almost succeeds, but Mal pulls her from the chapel before she is crushed by the falling roof.

   While Alina is recovering from her fight with the Darkling, he begins training her army and also himself. He apologizes and realizes that all he wants to do is make sure Alina has the support she needs and deserves, no matter who she is and what she decides to do. He is there for her. He even decides to step aside and allow her to marry Nikolai if she wants and if that's what's best for Ravka.

   While searching for the last amplifier, Mal and Alina find out the truth about Mal's heritage. He is descended from Baghra's sister, making him a great-nephew of the Darkling. It also makes him an amplifier. He accepts this fate, understanding and willing to die for Alina. Later, Alina tells him they were always meant to be together, and asks him not to give his life for her - that they'll find another way.

  <p key="bba397a7-ee49-45be-b7df-b0a5b84e51dc">
   In the Fold, Mal sacrifices himself to Alina so that she can defeat the Darkling. However, after Mal dies and Alina uses the amplifier, her power is given to many of the soldiers nearby as well as scattered across the continent, and she is left powerless against the Darkling. Tolya and Tamar use their Heartrender skills to bring Mal back, an impossible feat made possible because being an amplifier, he had two lives. With one taken he was left with the life that he was meant to have. In doing so, however, he loses his ability to track.

   After the death of the Darkling, Mal and Alina are presumed dead by most of Ravka. They adopt Misha, take new names for themselves, and are married. They journey back to the ruins of Keramzin, their childhood orphanage, and rebuild it with a bit of help from King Nikolai. They go on to live under aliases and running the orphanage for the rest of their lives. They are visited during the first winter by Genya, David, and Zoya, some of the only people who know who they truly are.

   The Darkling having returned to life in the body of Yuri, demanded to see Alina again. A meeting is arranged between them at an abandoned sanatorium, and Mal is there to accompany Alina. During the meeting, the Darkling unexpectedly jumped between Mal and Alina who had been holding hands at that moment, and drove a piece of thorn wood he had kept hidden in his clothes through their hands. He needed the blood of the person who had killed him and a person who was related to him by blood in order to gain his powers back. He then managed to escape.

   Zoya then suggested they placed guards at the orphanage or moved them to a safer location because the Darkling might go after them. Alina and Mal refused and left to go back to Keramzin with Misha, and Oncat.

   Mal is confident, snarky, and at times cocky. Although Mal has his faults, he is loyal, willing to walk to great lengths just to get to Alina and remain by her side. Throughout the series, his personality develops; at first he could be whiny and sometimes selfish, but then he was willing to step aside as romantic interest so Alina, the girl he loved, could be with then-prince Nikolai to have the power and influence she needed, all the while staying by her side, helping, supporting and defending her no matter if it hurt him.

    I missed you every hour. And you know what the worst part was? It caught me completely by surprise. I'd catch myself walking around to find you, not for any reason, just out of habit, because I'd seen something that I wanted to tell you about or because I wanted to hear your voice. And then I'd realize that you weren't there anymore, and every time, every single time, it was like having the wind knocked out of me. I've risked my life for you. I've walked half the length of Ravka for you, and I'd do it again and again and again just to be with you, just to starve with you and freeze with you and hear you complain about hard cheese every day. So don't tell me we don't belong together. I’m sorry it took me so long to see you, Alina. But I see you now.

   Mal and Alina were raised together in the orphanage at Keramzin, and ended up serving in the Ravkan army together. Although they were best friends, Alina had always loved Mal but he was oblivious of this fact, constantly flirting with other girls and boasting about his conquests to Alina. After it was discovered Alina was Grisha and had to leave to go to the Little Palace, Mal became cold toward her.

   Alina not getting any of Mal's letters begins to develop feelings for the Darkling as they both share a bond due to being one of a kind Grisha. Later on, Alina realizes the Darkling had ulterior motives and her feelings dissolve. After finding a way to each other again, Alina and Mal's relationship further deteriorates, and another contender to Alina's heart enters the scene: Nikolai Lantsov, the then Prince of Ravka, who offers Alina his hand in marriage after they meet in the search for one of Morozova's three amplifiers.

   Ultimately, though, Mal and Alina end up together. The pair were thought to be dead by most of Ravka, this allows them to find a semblance of peace and privacy. They get married and run the old orphanage where they grew up in.
