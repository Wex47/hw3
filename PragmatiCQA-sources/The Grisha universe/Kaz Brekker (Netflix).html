Some form of traumatic lapse is preventing Alexei from remembering the ordeal, which is where Milana comes in. She eases his heart rate and asks what happened in the Fold. Alexei claims that they were saved by a Sun Summoner named
   Alina Starkov
   . Once he has all that he needs from Alexei, Dreesen shoots him in the head. Dreesen tells the Crows he has a ship that sails for West Ravka at dawn. The Crows have until then to prove that they have a way through the Fold and back. Should they fail, Pekka Rollins will be given the deal.

   Inej tells Kaz that she is aware he has no way to cross the Fold, and that she does not expect him to figure it out by dawn. Although, Kaz is determined to accept the job. Inej reminds Kaz that she can't leave
   Ketterdam
   due to her contract with the Menagerie. Kaz insists that she will join them and that he has a plan, however, Inej can tell that he's scrambling and worries that he won't come up with a sufficient plan in time. As Inej continues to question Kaz, he frustratingly exclaims that maybe they leave Inej behind, which he immediately regrets and attempts to apologize but Inej has disappeared by the time he rounds the corner.

   Kaz is attacked by Pekka Rollins and the

Rollins makes Kaz a deal: Kaz will walk away from the job and Rollins will take over for him or he can simply kill Kaz — cave his head in with his own cane and dump him in the harbor. Kaz looks up to Rollins and asks if they've ever made a deal before. Rollins doesn't recognize him and says that if they had crossed paths before then Kaz would know better or he'd be dead.

   Kaz meets with Jesper at the bar, telling him he was threatened to leave the job, but assures Jesper that he has no intention of being frightened off. He then inspects the floor of the Crow Club and sees a woman counting her money. He brings the woman to his office that he suspects of cheating the club out of money. She's been at the club every night for a week. She keeps track of what's played, and so now he'll have to add an extra deck to her table to balance the game. He then hands her a stack of

   , but the manner in which she counts her money would suggest she's from the east. The lady admits that her daughter is Grisha and that they fled so as not to be forced to fight in the war. Kaz isn't interested in reporting her. He only desires to know how she and her daughter crossed the Fold unscathed. The man who helped them goes by the name "
   the Conductor
   ," and he took them across in some sort of special transport. Once they got to Ketterdam, he left them with a stage performer named
   Poppy
   who took them in for a few nights.

   He meets with Jesper, who suggests they bring a demo expert, which Kaz denies as breaking into the Little Palace will need more subtlety and stealth. Jesper tells him the need for Inej, which Kaz says that her moral code that prevents her from killing, makes her a liability. He also says he can't buy out Inej's contract, as Tante Heleen would charge for more than he could afford. The two arrive outside the Emerald Palace, where Kaz tells Jesper to distract the guards so he can sneak in. Jesper acts as a distraction outside the
   Emerald Palace
   while Kaz sneaks inside to speak with Poppy. He shoots the club sign, allowing for Kaz to sneak in behind the bouncers. Kaz questions Poppy about the Conductor. Poppy reveals that much like Kaz,
   Tante Heleen
   inquired about the Conductor as well. So, Poppy warned the Conductor to steer clear of Heleen. However, in doing so, Poppy inadvertently led her to the Conductor. Kaz then demands to know where to find the Conductor, certain that Tante Heleen means to harm him so that Kaz can't pay off Inej's contract.

   Kaz arrives at the Conductor's address just as Inej is about to take his life. Kaz tells her to stop, revealing that her target is actually the only person capable of helping them cross the Fold and that Heleen tricked Inej into sabotaging their mission. Should they manage to pull this job off, Kaz assures Inej that she will be free of the Menagerie and then instructs the Conductor to get them to the

Having lost their way to the Little Palace, Kaz is still intent on traveling across the Fold. Arken requires 20 pounds of alabaster coal, a peck of Majdaloun jurda, and a goat. They are to meet at nightfall at the wreckage of a skiff northeast of the edge of town.
  </p>
  <p key="55098b99-9151-435e-a68d-5f93deee994f">
   After having retrieved the goat, Kaz notices Arken meeting up with
   General Zlatan
   , who is determined to separate from Ravka and form his own country. On his way back, he spots Inej at the memorial wall checking for the names of her parents and brother. She thought that if she saw their names then she could let them go. Inej's Sankta Lizabeta necklace is all that she had when she was sold to the Menagerie, and if it was worth anything, Heleen would've taken it. For Inej, it's a simple token of faith that her mother stitched. Kaz warns Inej that hope is dangerous and clouds her judgment.
  </p>
  <p key="563c02d5-8bf4-4c8e-bc83-e4b23a596cab">
   Kaz and Inej convene with Arken on the edge of town near the skiff wreck but Jesper is nowhere to be found. Arken takes them through a minefield to his mode of transportation — a train hidden within the Fold. Jesper comes running in their direction with an angry mob chasing after him, but they come to a stop as Jesper runs into the field to meet up with the others. Admittedly, he gambled away the money and was forced to steal the coal, though he only made off with 16 pounds worth. Arken sits each of them down and tells them to remain still and not to shift their weight. On his arm, Inej notices at least ten scratch marks, each one indicating a successful cross through the Fold.
  </p>
  <p key="000fc71f-1647-4e2a-bb22-fcaeabfb9962">
   Arken reveals that the tracks are not complete, though he's built slats on the car that rolled into place under the wheels and the turbines generate enough wind to push them to the eastern track as long as they don't shift their weight. Unfortunately, the noise from the train seemingly attracts nearby volcra. Generally, he would outrun the volcra, but with Jesper only acquiring 16 of the 20 pounds of required coal, that won't be possible. Jesper begins to panic and Arken instructs him to grab the goat — not to be used as bait rather to calm Jesper. Having gained a bit of composure, Jesper stands to his feet and begins firing at the volcra on the car with remarkable accuracy, buying them enough time to make it out the Fold.

   . Three days away from the Little Palace, the next play is finding a way inside. Fortunately, the Kribirsk archives house the Little Palace blueprints, but they're kept under lock and key, so they'll have to break in. Kaz leaves Arken at the bar and tasks him with finding them a ride to the Little Palace.

  <p key="bc06ec5f-d7d8-4ff8-b480-99de5b3b6b33">
   Kaz enters the Archives disguised as a renowned sculptor, claiming that he's working on a piece for the Winter Fete and that he needed the dimensions for the Little Palace entrances. The man at the front desk goes to pull the blueprints, during which time Kaz slides a pad coated in phosphorus under the man's shoe, leaving an invisible trail to the repository.

   That night, after Inej successfully retrieves the blueprints, the Crows return to the bar, where Arken manages to fulfill his end of the deal by finding them transportation to the Little Palace. He introduces them to Marko, the leader of the traveling troupe known as the Pomdrakon Players, who have been invited to perform at the Winter Fete.

Kaz walks the route Alina will take from the ballroom to the dinner event to look for an ambush point. He discovers a hidden door to a fitting room that only Grisha can enter and decides that is where they will grab her.

   Kaz tells Jesper, Inej, and Arken about the door-less fitting with a Grisha lock. Fortunately, the locking mechanisms are Fabrikator-designed and can be opened with a lodestone, which Arken just so happens to have in his possession. Given that Arken is the only one of them familiar with the lodestone, Kaz declares that Arken will grab Alina. The rest of them will be setting up a "lynx flush." Lynx are pack hunters who are very smart. They'll clear a path for the prey. In this case, Kaz, Jesper, and Inej are the lynx who will clear the path.

  <p key="59d2aa2f-8db1-46a6-a370-3f0fcc5206ad">
   Kaz and Inej enter the ballroom and witness as Alina invokes her sun summoning abilities, bringing light to the entire room, much to Inej's amazement. After Arken is captured by guards, Kaz reveals that the lynx flush was to smoke out Arken as punishment for conspiring with Zlatan in Novokribirsk to kill Alina rather than capture her. Kaz and Inej attempt to escort Alina out, but the Darkling intervenes and escorts her himself. Kaz and Inej then split up after noticing that they're being trailed by an
   Inferni

   Kaz is followed into the chapel by the Inferni soldier, who compares Kaz to a wounded spider. Kaz sneaks up behind the Inferni and crushes his hand with a stanchion to prevent him from summoning. When Kaz turns his back, the Inferni regains his footing and summons fire for which Kaz is defenseless against. Inej comes to his aid and kills the Inferni, lodging a single knife in the back of his head, her first ever kill, an act that takes a lot from her. And with more guards approaching, she is forced to leave her blade behind.

   The Crows arrive in Ryevost with Alina in the trunk. When she exits, they explain that they can provide safe passage through the Fold, but Alina would rather travel alone, refusing to be anyone else's captive. When they refuse to step aside, she blinds Kaz and Jesper, though Inej having a great deal of respect for the Sun Summoner, allows for her to flee.

  <p key="d5ae61ac-9bab-4116-afde-18f68bca4561">
   Kaz questions why Inej allowed for the target to get away. Inej explains that they were hired to pick up a fake, not abduct a living Saint who came to summon the sun instead. However, Kaz isn't convinced that she is an actual Sun Summoner. He warns Inej that they can't work effectively as a crew if she's making decisions based on religious zeal. Kaz then reveals that if they don't return with Alina then Heleen will get the Crow Club.

   Having wasted enough time searching for Alina, Kaz has decided to return to Ketterdam. Just then, the alarm in their wagon goes off and Kaz, Jesper, and Inej flee in different directions. Kaz comes face to face with the Darkling, who accuses him of kidnapping Alina. However, Kaz reveals that she fled on her own and that he doesn't know where she's at. In a fit of rage, the Darkling unleashes the Cut, but Kaz deploys a flash bomb and narrowly evades a killing blow, though his cane is cut in half in the process. The Crows reconvene and steal the Darkling's carriage.

  <p key="6128363c-7a48-4ba3-b091-152ae7f476de">
   Between their dwindling funds, lack of time, and conflicting interests, Kaz decides it's best to cut their losses and return to Ketterdam.
  </p>
  <p key="5c6bf7f3-ab5a-443a-ae09-d3ac9042f678">
   Inej joins Kaz by the fire with his cane and reveals that she's leaving. He admits that she was right about the Sun Summoner being real, though to him she's merely another Grisha who just so happens to summon the sun, not a Saint. If not Saints then what does Kaz believe in, Inej asks. He replies that he believes in himself and his crows, including her and Jesper. Crows don't just remember the face of the people who wronged them. They also remember those who are kind. No Saint has ever watched over Kaz, not like Inej has, he admits. When Inej says that she can't go back to the Menagerie, he assures her that she won't.
  </p>
  <p key="6c3c3a4f-f266-409c-b8c2-9b8f46e402d2">
   Kaz, Jesper, and Inej return to the site of Arken's train, but it has been discovered by a couple of soldiers. Arken's system was complicated and the ride was chaotic, but Kaz believes he can steer the train. Suddenly, the train explodes from an alarm Arken installed. So, the Crows devise a new plan to sneak onto the skiff which is scheduled to cross the Fold tomorrow. They ambush a Dignitary from the Winter Fete and his guards before stealing their clothes and their transport papers to board the skiff. "No mourners," Kaz says. "No funerals," Inej replies as they board the skiff.
  </p>
  <p key="40d2c1b6-8484-4374-acec-9d9c8f924f5c">
   The Crows retreat under a deck, where they assess their options. Kaz wants to wait for whatever it is that the General has planned, and though he may not have figured out the Darkling's plan, Kaz is certain he intends to attack Novokribirsk, as the look on the General's face is that of someone consumed with revenge. Inej then discovers
   Mal
   hidden below the deck as well. When Mal reveals that he's aboard to kill the General and save Alina, Kaz orders Inej to return Mal's gun, as he'll be joining them.
  </p>
  <p key="c731bd5c-ed8f-4c44-a122-1f88b5e1c095">
   When General Kirigan expands the Fold and consumes a small portion of Novokribirsk, Kaz insists they wait for the advantage before attacking, but Inej and Mal make their move and head up top to stop the Darkling. Kaz and Jesper stay below deck as Mal and Inej make their move against the Darkling, and Jesper chooses to go up to help. Kaz warns him that the Darkling and his forces are at the advantage, but Jesper insists it is because he is not in the game. Kaz follows Jesper up and he pushes Jesper out of the way as the Darkling tries to kill them with the Cut, knocking Jesper out in the process. When Inej's blade fails to kill the Darkling, he then proceeds to engulf their end of the ship in darkness, making them vulnerable to the volcra. Kaz uses his cane to save Inej from a volca. While Kaz and Inej fend off the volcra, Alina grabs Inej's knife and stabs General Kirigan, removing the Stag's bone embedded in his hand, granting Alina full control of her abilities and expanding the light to shield the entire skiff. As she calls on the light, and Mal tackles General Kirigan overboard, where he is ripped apart by the volcra. Alina then awakens and sends lights throughout the Fold, allowing for them to escape.

  <p key="cfbd8fef-378a-482b-ad93-ca523680e8ad">
   The Crows, Alina, Mal, and Zoya gather in a clearing after escaping the Fold. While Jesper and Inej are set on letting Alina go, Kaz is not entirely convinced. Alina then pays Kaz off with royal jewelry, which would at least make up for the payment they could've made from the job. Alina tells him that it is not a gift, but payment for his silence of her survival, and the two shake hands in agreement. Zoya decided to go to Novokribirsk, to find out the fate of her family who lived there, but Kaz cautioned her that knowing their fate could haunt her. She tells him that not knowing would haunt her even more.
  </p>
  <p key="390d1802-6d3d-4188-b705-40e3b94b52a7">
   Inej recalls Kaz berating her for letting Alina go, and now he's doing just that. She questions why. Kaz replies that he's keeping his promise to Inej. He swore that she wouldn't go back to the Menagerie, and one of the gemstones will cover her debt. Inej contemplates joining Alina, but Kaz says that he needs her. Inej agrees to return to Ketterdam only to see the look on Helen's face when they pay her debt in full. She's not sure what will follow after.
  </p>
  <p key="27fde4e8-9f29-4123-93c8-a9cccaa6a333">
   Kaz, Jesper, and Inej board a ship headed for Ketterdam. Kaz is plotting their next move as both Dreesen and Pekka Rollins will be after their heads when they return. Just like with how their previous plan started, they'll need a Heartrender. Overhearing the conversation, along with rumors of the Sun Summoner's death, Nina Zenik asks them if the rumors were true. Kaz says he does not know if the Sun Summoner died, but he agreed that she was a Saint.

   Kaz is cold-hearted and shows very little compassion or empathy. There's nothing more important to him than revenge and money. His willingness to take on any job no matter the task is what earned him the nickname "Dirtyhands."
