    Dreaming Plague
   </b>
   was a plague caused by the creature
   Annona
   that inhibited those infected from dreaming, and rendering them insane before they ultimately died. The plague was responsible for killing almost all the
   Iron Tribe
   members.

Starving for dreams, she eventually found the Iron Tribe and began to eat the dreams out of them. After the process the victim would be unable to dream, which would cause them to go insane and eventually die.

   Telluris
   encountered Annona on the surface world and, after a series of events, transported Annona to an unknown location and rid
