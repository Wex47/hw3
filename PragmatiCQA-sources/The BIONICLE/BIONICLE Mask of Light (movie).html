  <p key="ab2a2304-6646-4129-bf51-686aa743f0e8">
   The movie revolves around the island of Mata Nui. The spirit protecting the island, put into a deep sleep, has returned and only the Mask of Light, in the hands of two Matoran who are assisted by six heroes, can return it to the Toa of Light and return his mask before it is too late.
  </p>
  <p key="494235e7-d97e-4f46-b4d0-f098f4533060">
   The direct-to-video sales made Mask of Light one of the top selling DVDs of 2003 in the United States, and has helped in the development of two more movies in the franchise. It was praised for its visual effects and sound direction, but thought to be average in its storyline and character development.

The match carries on into the night, Takua tries a new move he has been developing but it fails spectacularly. The match concludes with Ga-Koro emerging victorious.

The Mask's beam of light originally fell on Takua, but the Chronicler - unwilling to accept the mantle of responsibility - had nudged the mask so that its beam of light fell on Jaller instead, leading all the others to think that

   Vorahk

As the Matoran are forced to flee from their village, Takua realizes this is his fault, as he is the real Herald, meaning the Rahkshi are looking for him. Tahu, Gali, and Lewa arrive, and Tahu's scar has gotten worse. When he is hit by Kurahk’s anger energy, the poison and the anger cause him to completely lose his control of rage and sanity, and he attacks Gali. He is stopped when Kopaka arrives, freezing the enraged Tahu in ice. Meanwhile, Pohatu and Onua cause a cave in, and the Toa are forced to flee the village. Gali, Kopaka, and Lewa later use their various healing powers to free Tahu from his madness and cure his wounds.

   Takua finds Jaller and the two head for the Kini Nui, which the mask says the Seventh Toa should be. Takua takes the mask and begins shaking it. At that moment, a blast then shoots from it and destroys a section of the Great Temple, revealing something underneath. At that moment, all six Rahkshi surround them. The Toa come to their aid, and destroy all the Rahkshi except

   Later, Takanuva is mourning at Jaller's grave, and he wonders aloud whether his death was worth it. Turaga Vakama, however, walks up and reassures him. Later, the Toa finish building the
   Ussanui
   out of Rahkshi parts, and Hahli adds the final touch to the front of the vehicle: Jaller's mask. As Takanuva mounts the vehicle and prepares to fly it into Makuta's lair, his fellow Toa ask why they can't come with him. Takanuva replies that it is his destiny to defeat Makuta, while theirs lies with the Matoran and the Turaga. He tells them to gather the latter and wait for him to come back. The Toa of Light flies down through the dark tunnels and jumps out of the Ussanui before it could hit a stone door. As he passes, Hahli emerges from the wreckage, picking up Jaller's mask, declaring "It's time someone was

   that powered the Ussanui) where the Master of Shadows taunts him, and tells him that he is no hero, just a big failure. He remarks that he should just leave but the Toa refuses and sends Hahlii to fetch the others. To decide the fate of Mata Nui (both the island and the Great Spirit), Makuta challenges Takanuva to a "simple game of Kolhii" (played with a ball of

   While the players compete, Hahli returns to the surface to tell everyone to come below and awaken Mata Nui. Turaga Vakama wants to go but Turaga Onewa warns him that they may never return should they go down. This makes the group begin to debate amongst themselves when Hahli calls their attention and cites what a wonderful home their island is and that in order to honour Jaller's memory, they must go down and awaken the Great Spirit, to which everyone cheers. As they arrive, Makuta destroys the cave entrance, preventing them from leaving. Takanuva uses his Kolhii move from the start of the movie to throw the ball at Makuta; this time executing it perfectly allowing the ball to hit it's target and win him the game. Makuta then rises, stating he will continue to protect Mata Nui, claiming that while his brother is sleeping he is spared pain. Takanuva retorts that he is not protecting Mata Nui and Makuta replies that his duty is to the Mask of Shadows. Takanuva remarks "then let's take a closer look behind that mask!". He then leaps onto the Master of Shadows, rips off his mask and the two fall into a pool of Energized Protodermis. For a few moments, nothing happens but then they emerge as a giant fused being:

   . The combined being lifts the gate to allow everyone through, then regenerates Jaller by sending some of his energies into Jaller's mask. However, this transfer leaves Takutanuva too weak to hold the door up, and it crushes him. As the dust clears, only the Mask of Light remains. Turaga Vakama picks up the mask, placing Jaller, Hahli and the mask in the symbols of Unity, Duty and Destiny respectively, reviving Takanuva. Using his light makes a hole in the cavern, revealing the long lost city of

   Miramax and Lego made a partnership in 2002 to develop and distribute three BIONICLE movies. When choosing a style for the movie to follow, directors Terry Shakespeare and David Molina noted that there were several already existing interpretations of the BIONICLE look, including the flash web comic, comic book, and CG commercials; they eventually decided upon the commercial look.
  </p>
  <p key="7f7d5d52-44e1-4d46-9925-1de47454ca34">
   After attending several days of "Bionicle school" in Denmark, they were given a grounding in how they were developed. Several features were redesigned for the movie, including the introduction of a movable mouth to allow for a more human character. Also, characters such as the Toa Nuva were redesigned, beginning with the creation of a skeleton and muscles. For the design, Shakespeare noted that "The first film had primary colors that were coded to the areas and a younger feel."
  </p>
  <p key="ecaf8760-f850-485d-91cc-758d71958621">
   Two scripts for the movie were created, one by writer Alastair Swinnerton (also one of the original BIONICLE creators) and one from the other, Henry Gilroy, to see who would write the better script. Due to time constraints, however, the Gilroy script was accepted with some of Alastair's ideas included. He reported that creator Bob Thompson, who had reportedly had some of the characters in mind for years. "I really made it my duty to stick close by his vision, while bringing my ideas of comical character and big screen action, all the while staying true to the LEGO ideals of construction and community." The Lego Company insists they would "never compromise their values for the bottom line." The movie was also an occasion for the expansion of the BIONICLE universe by the addition of the Rahkshi and its line of toys.
