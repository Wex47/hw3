   Pridak and the other Barraki were forced to be confined in the Pit, mutated into water-breathers that could never set foot on land again. Some time later, Pridak organized an army of
   Takea

   They stayed there for quite some time, until news of the Mask of Life came. The Barraki agreed to do everything they could to get that mask, because if they did, they could become air breathers again. Pridak immediately went to action, and destroyed
   Defilak
   's sub, with Defilak,
   Sarda
   ,
   Gar
   and
   Idris
   inside it, though they were not dead. He brought them to a cave to ask them about the Mask of Life, and what they knew about it. When Sarda refused to answer, Pridak showed his harshness by dragging him out of his water bubble and throwing him to his waiting army of Takea Shark. He then asked Defilak to show him. Gar and Idris swam away to Mahri Nui. However, Defilak delayed, and Pridak was becoming angry, when a
   300-foot Venom Eel
   arrived. Pridak knew that this beast was created from the Mask of Life, and followed its direction. He found Mantax, another Barraki, who told him where it came from. They both left to see the Mask of Life. When they got there,

   , as well as the other Barraki, were all there. When Pridak attempted to take Brutaka on, he was defeated. He later woke up and agreed with the others that Brutaka was a phony, and had him taken away by a
   Giant Squid
   . Then, all six of them went to confront
   Dekar
   , the Matoran with the mask. Pridak took it from him, and was cursed-he now was incredibly overreactional and prone to anger from the least bit of a nuisance. Takadox managed to calm him with his hypnotizing powers.

   . The Barraki captured the Toa Mahri and put them into confined cells, while attending a meeting about who should take the Mask of Life. They eventually came to an agreement-
   Nocturn
   , Ehlek's lieutenant, should take the mask because he was too stupid to do anything with it. However, Pridak soon found out that the Toa Mahri had escaped, and he commanded the Barraki to split up into groups and destroy them. He teamed up with Takadox, and they found

The Barraki eventually realized that they had been tricked by the Toa Mahri, and they started to gather up to attack them, when a meeting was called for from Mantax. Pridak attended the meeting, just like all the Barraki, and realized that Mantax had both the Mask of Life and the Betrayal Contract. Mantax had started to give a list of demands when an avalanche fell, causing chaos. Pridak battled the Toa Mahri but the six Toa escaped. However, the Barraki began to gather up their armies to destroy the Toa Mahri when Maxilos interfered, revealing that he was Teridax. Pridak was the most angry, stating that Teridax had ruined their lives enough, without interfering again. However, "Maxilos" simply stated that he was not interfering, and knocked out all six Barraki. However, Maxilos/Makuta had failed to realize one thing-the Barraki's armies were still at large. They had destroyed Maxilos and left

   Mantax found Pridak and gave him the original Hydraxon's Helmet. Pridak found out the current Hydraxon was not the original, and gathered his army of Takea sharks to find the jailer. While fighting Hydraxon, Pridak stated that a Matoran named Dekar had disappeared just when Hydraxon appeared, thinking he would fool Hydraxon. Not listening, Hydraxon defeated Pridak and took him to the Pit.

   After being released from the Pit, Pridak gathered an small army and ventured outwards. On the first island he attacked, Pridak discovered that an older fortress existed underneath the one he was attacking with his army. He explored the fortress, and discovered a pile of rubble with writing on it located in a sub-basement. Believing that it was destroyed by someone (Zaktan) who did not want the content known, he began to piece the wall back together.

   After reading the details of the Brotherhood's plot, he contacted the other Barraki to propose an alliance to the leader of the Dark Hunters, making an offer of information on the viruses the Shadowed One had found on Xia. The leader of the Dark Hunters agreed, on the condition that he and Pridak meet in the recently destroyed realm of Karzahni. They met, and made a deal to take Teridax out of power.

   With his legions ready for battle, Pridak decided to travel to Metru Nui anyway. Before Pridak and his army could reach Metru Nui, Teridax was killed by a fragment of Bota Magna. As a result, he marched his army out of the Matoran universe onto the newly formed Spherus Magna, where his mutations were undone by the Kanohi Ignika.

   Pridak was the unofficial leader of the Barraki and previously was the unofficial leader of the League. He was a fiery leader and would not hesitate to reward disobedience or insolence with pain. He once blinded Kalmah in one eye and bit off one of Nocturn's arms in a separate engagement. Pridak was a leader who ruled with his emotions, able to hold a grudge against someone indefinitely. His mutations were possibly the worst punishment he could receive, before his transformation he took great pride in his own appearance and believed creatures that carried monstrous faces such as the one he would later bear did not deserve to live.

   He, like the other Barraki, despised Teridax, and would not hesitate to defy him to his face. He was also almost as complex a thinker as the Makuta. His hate for Teridax was especially intense, as he alone once worked as little more than a slave of the Brotherhood of Makuta. Although hot-headed, he was very practical, since he saw no gain from killing the Matoran of
