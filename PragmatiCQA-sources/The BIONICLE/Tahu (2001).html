   Toa Canister
   was built in

   in combat. During this training, Tahu's early skills and cunningness in battle made him the first to complete Hydraxon's training by defeating him in personal combat, which sealed his destiny as the leader of the Toa Mata. To symbolize this,
   Artakha

   At some point in time, Tahu and Kopaka allowed themselves to be captured by the Order at the fortress so they could get inside. There, they met in person with Helryx, who agreed to tell them of their mission and future. After their training, the Toa Mata were sent to Karda Nui to protect the

   . After an immense battle, the Manas were defeated through the destruction of control towers and the removal of their infected Kanohi. The Toa then un-fused and headed into Makuta's lair.

   In the next chamber they heard Makuta speak, telling them that they would defeat themselves. Suddenly, a stranger that looked like Tahu attacked the Toa of Fire. Eventually, all of the Toa had shadow counterparts. They struggled against these, but Onua finally realized that they had to be destroyed by fighting a different Toa's counterpart, not your own. The Shadow Toa were quickly finished off, Tahu's double crushed by Pohatu, while Tahu used intense flame to melt Gali's.

   Now the Toa were ready to fight Teridax. However, all they found was a Matoran with a pitted mask and shadowy infected body. The Toa were surprised at his form, but after a philosophical debate Makuta changed himself into a swirling vortex of mechanical parts which sprouted dark tentacles and began attacking them. The Toa combined their powers and caught Teridax by surprise. Makuta left with the words: "You cannot destroy me, for I am Nothing." They were then teleported out of Makuta's lair to the surface, believing Makuta to have been defeated.

   Makuta was defeated, but there was a rumble from the ground and a Ta-Matoran came running to the Toa. The Matoran was saying one word over and over again:
   <a href="Bohrok.html" key="69d6d59b-7d03-4be0-b4eb-37d214543b11" title="Bohrok">
    Bohrok
   </a>
   . The Toa took him to Ta-Koro, only to find it was being destroyed by strange insectoid creatures with elemental power, known as Bohrok. Upon defeating the Bohrok, Vakama then told the Toa of the swarms, as well as that they were to collect all eight breeds of
   Krana
   from all six breeds of Bohrok.
  </p>
  <p key="b9f4d7fb-eb7b-446f-8a52-a703e1bcd107">
   The Toa split up, each going to their home village. As they battled Bohrok and collected Krana, they learned that the Bohrok were not really alive, but vehicles for the sentient Krana. They also learned that Krana had the ability to control the minds of others by taking the place of their mask. Tahu learned through Kopaka that there was a Bohrok nest in Mount Ihu. Tahu wanted to charge right in, but Kopaka advised against this, saying it would be wiser to wait for the other Toa. A short while later, the other Toa met up with them and they all descended into the nest. Tahu went into the heart of the Bohrok nest alone and was trapped. For a brief moment, his mask was replaced with a Krana, but not long enough for him to be controlled by it. He superheated the air, causing the central chamber to explode. He met up with the other Toa in a different chamber, only for the floor they were standing on to collapse as they fell to the bottom of the nest.
  </p>
  <p key="d1c76ef4-eecd-43e9-ae4c-1b5afd4e6865">
   They found niches where the Krana could fit, and, placing the krana in the niches, six chambers opened, each leading to an

   suit of armor. Each Toa donned the armor. Tahu encountered
   Cahdok
   , the blue
   Bahrag
   queen. He drove her out of a tunnel and into the main chamber, as Kopaka did with
   Gahdok
   , the red queen. The Bahrag backed up against each other, and the Toa began to fight. But they could not use their elemental powers, and the Bahrag seemed to have a force field around them. The queens both possessed all of the Bohroks' elemental powers, as well as powers of illusion, thus the Toa were losing quickly.
  </p>
  <p key="9fe5eb83-aed8-4a4d-9861-87a98662341a">
   Tahu realized that the Exo-Toa armor was hindering the use of their elemental powers, and commanded the Toa to shed it. He urged the others to surround the Bahrag and attack as a group. Combining their powers to form a Toa Seal, the Toa trapped the Bahrag in a cage of
   Protodermis
   before falling into tubes filled with
   Energized Protodermis
   , transforming them. With new armour, tools,
   Kanohi Nuva
   and enhanced powers, Tahu dubbed their new forms "

   With the Bohrok defeated, the Toa Nuva returned home and began to repair the damage done by the Bohrok. Each Toa had suddenly received a symbol at their respective Suva upon becoming Toa Nuva. Shortly after Tahu Nuva received his, Turaga Vakama gave Tahu the

   At their first meeting as Toa Nuva, the Toa all got into a fight while showing off their new powers. An argument began, once again resulting in the Toa going their separate ways, as Gali pleaded them not to, reminding them that they were six beings who shared one destiny. Tahu returned to Ta-Koro and encountered a strange new Bohrok, the
   Tahnok-Kal
   . When the Tahnok-Kal was escaping with Tahu Nuva's symbol, the Toa Nuva of Fire confronted him at the gates to Ta-Koro. When he attempted to use his fire powers to stop the Tahnok-Kal, he was momentarily stunned by his inability to do so. Tahnok-Kal took advantage of the delay to collapse the gateway above him, burying Tahu in a pile of rubble. By the time Tahu extricated himself, Tahnok-Kal had vanished. Tahu, Takua and

  </p>
  <p key="f3c502df-a79c-4bcf-9248-56673821ffff">
   When in Le-Wahi, Lewa Nuva literally fell in on the group. He explained that his powers had disappeared as well, and joined the three in their pursuit of the Bohrok-Kal. The search led them next to Po-Wahi, where the two Bohrok-Kal they were observing met with another. This revelation led to the discovery of Pohatu, also powerless, encased in magnetized
   Mahi
   . The two Toa Nuva freed their ally, and he joined with them in the search. Their path led them all over Mata Nui, where the rest of the Toa Nuva, their powers also stolen, joined with them.

  <p key="b079a691-d0b7-4899-bb25-81dbb5e515df">
   Eventually, they ran into six creatures who resembled Bohrok, but possessed the ability of speech, as well as different elemental powers than the Bohrok swarms. They called themselves the

   , and claimed to be searching for the Bahrag. The Toa Nuva attempted to fight them, but were essentially helpless without their own elemental powers. They were all rendered unconscious by a combined attack of Vacuum, Sonics, and Electricity from the Bohrok-Kal. When they awoke, the Toa Nuva learned that the Bohrok-Kal had
   Krana-Kal
   , as the Bohrok had Krana. They split up to retrieve the Krana-Kal from the Bohrok-Kal, sure that when they are removed, the Bohrok-Kal would be rendered helpless.          
Tahu tried to get
   Pahrak-Kal
   's Krana-Kal, but was failing horribly. So enraged was he that it appeared he would rather sacrifice himself than give in.

   then arrived and told him that he had no right to do so, and subsequently wrenched the Krana-Kal from Pahrak-Kal's body. Unfortunately, a
   Gahlok Va
   quickly replaced it with a new one. Faced with this, the two ran away in retreat.
  </p>
  <p key="5cc1ec4c-fc6e-412b-93f4-ec43b3cec2ac">
   Later, Tahu met up with Lewa in
   Le-Wahi
   while searching for Kanohi Nuva. Lewa decided to be his guide through the jungle, and Tahu agreed. The Toa came to a swamp where
   Nuhvok-Kal
   had been earlier, as Tahu had figured out by studying impossibly heavy trees blocking the path. Lewa formed a plan to get several
   Le-Matoran
   to jump out from all directions and surprise Nuhvok-Kal. They got the Le-Matoran ready, and Tahu lured Nuhvok-Kal over by taunting him and then swinging on vines back to the swamp. The plan worked, but Nuhvok-Kal escaped.

  <p key="8a5bf2e0-21af-4976-9679-c7f82e5a356e">
   Gali later summoned Kopaka and Tahu to meet up with her to get their last three Kanohi Nuva in the
   Place of Shadow
   . Tahu and Kopaka argued throughout the trip despite Gali's attempts to calm them. After getting through several challenges, they reached the masks, out in the open. They took the masks, only for the ground to crumble underneath them, leading to a chamber far below where they found the other Toa Nuva as well as Turaga Vakama. They encountered a huge beast known as the
   Rahi Nui
   . With Vakama's help, they were able to beat the beast and then combined the powers of the
   Miru Nuva
   and
   Kakama Nuva
   to fly out of the chamber.
  </p>
  <p key="a0a70e22-8956-4c42-bc82-cd1022650d4c">
   Eventually, Tahu met up with Pohatu and Onua in
   Le-Wahi
   , who had a disturbing discovery that they refused to tell until they met up with the others. Soon enough, Kopaka, Gali and Lewa arrived and told of how they had formed a
   Toa Kaita Nuva
   ,
   Wairuha Nuva
   , to try to defeat Kohrak-Kal, Lehvak-Kal, and Gahlok-Kal, but they formed their own
   Kaita
   and beat Wairuha Nuva easily. Pohatu and Onua told of their discovery: they had defeated Tahnok-Kal and removed its Krana-Kal, but the Krana-Kal said they were too late, that the Bahrag had already been found.
  </p>
  <p key="98d8a264-2c1f-4be3-94f1-4e5810783380">
   The Toa Nuva finally descended into the Bohrok nest and had Lewa levitate down first. He saw the Bohrok-Kal fighting the Exo-Toa, the Bahrag in their prison and a large floating cube with spaces to put in the Toa's symbols. The Toa went down into the Bahrag's chamber, hoping the Kanohi Nuva masks they had found would be enough. Once down there, Tahu revealed to the others how Vakama had given him the Vahi. Unfortunately, the Vahi didn't affect the Kal who were protected by a force field as they drew so close to the end of their mission.
  </p>
  <p key="65a42d1f-2782-4122-99a7-c8733fcd12aa">
   Then Gali had an idea--to channel their power through their symbols and into the Bohrok-Kal. The Bohrok-Kal became arrogant with their newfound power, beginning to think they would not need to awaken the Bahrag. But the power continued to flow, and eventually an overload of power destroyed each Bohrok-Kal. The Toa Nuva, their elemental powers returned to them, returned to their villages and hid their symbols in more secure locations, for a period of peace and prosperity.

   After the Bohrok-Kal were defeated, a new era of peace rose upon
   Mata Nui
   . The day of the first Kolhii game in the Ta-Koro stadium came. Just before the game, Tahu was in the Lava Falls of

   when he saw Takua about to be killed by a giant lava wave. Tahu saved him with his
   Hau Nuva

   fell from Jaller's bag and projected its light onto him. After learning that a seventh Toa was on his way, Tahu suggested that it was Jaller's duty to search for him. However, this revelation also caused Tahu unease; if Makuta's threats had been defeated, then why was a new Toa needed now?
  </p>

   Lerahk

  <p key="c09d0e70-f41c-4d4f-9458-c928b96a3b38">
   Tahu became more and more aggressive, due to the poison spreading through his system and the loss of Ta-Koro. In Onu-Koro his anger was increased by
   Kurahk
   to the point that he turned against his fellow Toa, and it took the combined effort of Lewa, Kopaka, and Gali to heal him. Once again realizing the Toa needed to be united to defeat the Rahkshi, Tahu and the other Toa journeyed to Kini-Nui. There Tahu combined his powers with Lewa and trapped
   Guurahk
   , Lerahk and
   Panrahk
   in glass, before helping the other Toa defeat Kurahk and

   After the first battle in the sky at Karda Nui, the Toa Nuva split up. Tahu led Gali and Onua into the so-called Swamp of Secrets that puddled at the bottom of Karda Nui. The three decided they would split up. Tahu soon came across the
   Codrex
   . However, he didn't know what it was. When he approached the Codrex, he was blasted backwards by the Codrex's energy shield and laid barely conscious in the mud.

   soon appeared, and began to feast on his energy. While feasting, Krika related to Tahu why the Brotherhood hated the Toa so much. As Tahu continued to lose his energy, he shot a ball of Fire into the sky, alerting the other Toa of his situation. Tahu then channeled heat into the mud around him, increasing the temperature until it was searing hot, and Krika turned intangible and escaped. He was then reunited with Gali and Onua, who had all encountered the other two

   Gorast
   and
   Bitil
   , and followed their trails to the Codrex. Before the Makuta attacked, the Toa were directed away by an
   Av-Matoran
   to a nearby cave. Inside the cave, the Toa witnessed several other Av-Matoran who were transforming into Bohrok. The Av-Matoran then explained that once their lifetime comes to an end, they transform into Bohrok and are transported into the Bohrok Nest below Mata Nui. The Av-Matoran then handed a
   Keystone
   to the Toa, and took on the shocking transformation as well. After witnessing the transformation, Tahu was saddened by the fact that he did not ask the Matoran his name, and that it took so much sacrifices for the life of one.

  <p key="4948547d-aecd-4503-b0a5-f44e2458cbf1">
   Departing the cave, the Toa walked carefully through the swamp. Tahu then suggested that they would use the Nuva-exclusive Elemental Power time-bomb trick to attack the Makuta at their field base. They succeeded, but their plans were quickly discovered by the Makuta. Gali formed a wall of mist, and the Toa escaped, with Onua carving a tunnel through the ground. However, Tahu soon realized that the Makuta were not following. He deduced from that that the Makuta believed they would journey to the Codrex, where they planned to go, and ambush them there. Tahu ordered Onua to turn back, and the three Toa emerged from the tunnel and approached the Codrex from the sky, protected by the mist above the swamp. They found out that the Makuta had indeed journeyed to the Codrex.       
In the swamp the Toa had found some small pieces of what looked like a small clay figure in the same shape as the hole on the Mask of Life. It fit perfectly in a keyhole on the Codrex. All of a sudden the Codrex slid open and a brightly lit tunnel was apparent. The Toa walked through and they saw vehicles of tremendous power. When they got on they underwent yet another transformation. They became extremely aerodynamic. But then they saw that the Makuta were on vehicles too.

   Tahu quickly formulated a plan, and the three Toa led a large scaled attack on the three Makuta. However, their plan was quickly met by the Makuta, and it was soon that the battle entered a stalemate, with neither sides winning. To the Toa's misfortune, the other

   . He later came up with a plan - even if Teridax had control over the entire Matoran Universe, his mind was not designed to control it. Therefore, he thought, if they split up and caused trouble at many places at once, maybe Teridax would lose his grip on the Universe.
