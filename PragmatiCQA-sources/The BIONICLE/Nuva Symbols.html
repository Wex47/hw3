   after leaving the lair.

   In the climax of their battle with the Bahrag, the Toa Mata combined their elemental powers to form a cage of Protodermis to immobilize the Bahrag. Since such a state of Protodermis is easily reversible by any input of external energy, the Toa Nuva devised a plan to house their elemental powers within a device to counteract any energy fluctuations bestowed on the Protodermis cage to break its state. Originally forming a sphere (the Nuva Lock), the Toa Nuva decided it would be the safest option to split this sphere apart into seven parts (the six Nuva Symbols and the central
   Nuva Cube
   ), with the six Nuva Symbols being teleported to the Toa's respective
   Suva
   immediately and the central Nuva Cube remaining in the Bahrag's lair. This way, only the Toa Nuva could free the swarms (under unanimous decision, as a further failsafe in case one or more of them fall under the influence of
   Krana
   ,

   , or other methods of mind control), and intruders to the Bahrag's lair would be unable to break the Protodermis cage without joining all pieces together first.

   Since this system was a desperate solution to stop the swarms immediately, the ad-hoc design had an unforeseen critical flaw. Since the Toa Nuva invested their elemental energy into the Nuva Symbols to provide their function, and maintain control over them from the island's surface through the Suvas, removal of the symbols from the Suvas would cause the Toa Nuva to lose their elemental powers entirely by disrupting this system. This flaw was exploited by the

   mysteriously allowed the Toa Nuva to regain full mental control of the power they stored in the symbols, thus allowing them to unleash their power upon the Bohrok-Kal. The Bohrok-Kal were utterly destroyed in the process, and the Bahrag seal was preserved.

    While the Nuva Symbols were stated to be "likely" made by

    , this point was not necessarily worded as definitive canon as is therefore not convincing. As originally stated in the comics, each one was created on
