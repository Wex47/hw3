   Since we have no
   Chronicler
   accompanying us on this, our most vital mission, I am taking time to record events for posterity.
   Tahu
   thinks this is a foolish waste of time, and I am sure
   Kopaka
   agrees with him (so rare to see those two agreeing!). But
   Onua

   The information we found in the Great Temple of Metru Nui was in the form of a

   We had approached from the north, intending to go over the mountains and attack the fortress by surprise. There were fewer guards in this region, since the natural barriers made it difficult to pass. A formidable blue and white Dark Hunter that Tahu recognized as

   Lewa

   Although my fellow Toa Nuva and I had chosen the least guarded approach to the fortress, we still had to deal with our share of sentries and wandering Dark Hunters. The trick was to knock them out before they could raise an alarm – something that is much easier to do when you have Lewa along. A
   Toa of Air
   can create a quick vacuum around an enemy, and with no air, the sound of his shouts can’t travel.

   After making our way as quickly as we dared to the fortress, we stood at the rear stone wall. Pohatu made a stone hand emerge from the blocks to grab the lone guard and squeeze him into unconsciousness. Then another use of his power opened a way for us to get inside.

   When we came to the realm of Karzahni in pursuit of Icarax, we found hundreds of Matoran, their spirits as crushed as their bodies were distorted. These victims of Karzahni had been inexplicably abandoned (for there was no sign of the realm’s ruler when we arrived, or the

   It turned out we had no need to search for Icarax – he struck at us from ambush. At first we thought he was the Makuta we had fought before, for he wore the Mask of Shadows. But he was, if anything, a more skilled and ferocious warrior, felling my teammates with swift, sure blows.

   Gali had a thought. “What about the island of Mata Nui? Will it repair what the Bohrok did there?”
  </p>
  <p key="0275f375-967b-4441-be48-ff134863a35c">
   The voice laughed. “No, the Bohrok did what they were meant to do, even as you have done. And now, Toa Nuva, you have one more task to perform ... the most dangerous of them all.”
  </p>

    Entry 10
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="5800d5b4-acb9-473f-b67a-8de27faad3d1">
   My fellow Toa and I stood in a small chamber, waiting for the one who would lead us to our next, and supposedly most dangerous, task. In the meantime, we checked our weapons and armor for any damage and got caught up on each others' adventures. It was a good way to hide any worries we might have.
  </p>
  <p key="46e7410e-6e2b-4f3b-a313-51891e5e1539">
   "It was a golden crystal," Onua was saying. "About as big as Pohatu's head, and suspended in mid-air - don't ask me how. We'd been told not to let it touch the ground, and it was a good thing we listened."
  </p>
  <p key="cb90aec2-5d38-4061-b91a-a3bba99a5bbf">
   "Why?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p key="f30c87e0-90c1-41d1-b824-36598f77fffe">
   "Heart of the Visorak, they call it," answered Pohatu. "Ever wonder how the Makuta get the horde assembled? Put this crystal in the ground and they all come, no matter how far away. I guess our hosts don't want the Brotherhood able to gather them quite so easily next time."
  </p>
  <p key="0b474d84-0ebf-4244-8b0b-02b739c1754c">
   "What about you, Lewa?" I said to the Toa of Air. "Where did Tahu send you?"
  </p>
  <p key="a0e1ac6c-0e3d-4695-96c4-509aed6b66be">
   "No place," shrugged Lewa Nuva. "Some weird voice sent me up to Mata Nui - I must have been and gone just before you arrived, Gali - to deep-dig up a
   sundial
   , of all things, and bring it to Metru Nui."
  </p>
  <p key="823ab9ee-54b5-4d6d-8d61-3dc73fc012fa">
   "And do what with it?" asked Tahu, never looking up from his scorched armor. Kopaka looked even worse after their struggle to cap erupting volcanoes.
  </p>
  <p key="84e2aa31-46ad-483d-88f7-906b637d8bca">
   "Got me," said Lewa. "I was told to leave it in the Archives, so that's what I did. By the way, after quick-seeing our old island, never hire the Bohrok as decorators."
  </p>
  <p key="af04e46e-1aa3-401c-8dd1-bd3e78a1efc9">
   "It's time to go." The words, spoken softly, came from a Matoran who stood in the doorway. "We have a journey to make and little time in which to make it."
  </p>
  <p key="5805935a-da19-4bce-b265-1b3a114cecb3">
   "A long journey where?" asked Kopaka. "I am getting a little tired of running around like a hungry
   Stone Rat
   with no idea why."
  </p>
  <p key="78d84de9-c91d-4a01-9d19-81646f3e51c5">
   The Matoran just smiled. "You are being given a great honor - to set foot on the
   island of Artakha
   . Once we are there,
   my master
   will speak to you ... or not ... depending on his whim. He may open his fortress for the first time in millenia and welcome you in - or he may banish you forever without a second thought."
  </p>
  <p key="34914db0-ece9-410d-a8bb-0357a01f1ed8">
   "Sounds like a party," said Pohatu. "When do we leave?"
  </p>
  <p key="b097b9a0-bcd0-42d8-94dc-beee9a4b082d">
   The world suddenly blurred around the Toa Nuva. When their vision cleared again, they were standing with the Matoran on a desolate beach. "Leave?" said the villager. "Why, you have already arrived. Good fortune to you, Toa ... may you live to leave Artakha once more."
