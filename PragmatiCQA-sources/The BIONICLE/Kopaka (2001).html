   Nui-Rama

  <p key="dbe5ce83-67f5-40c5-88b9-8a57dfa2801e">
   When they eventually reached Ko-Koro, Matoro introduced the Toa of Ice to Turaga

   Kane-Ra
   bull with an infected Kanohi, who had been guarding the mask. Luring the infected Rahi into a chasm, Pohatu sealed the hole with several large boulders. After the Rahi was defeated, Kopaka and Pohatu came across the temple of
   Kini-Nui

   Ta-Wahi
   , where one of his Kanohi, a
   Pakari
   , was located on a small island of rock in the center of a lake of lava. Freezing a hot spring and using the resulting slab of ice as a makeshift raft, Kopaka paddled across with his Ice Sword and retrieved the mask; however, on the way back to shore, he accidentally sliced a chunk off the raft with his sword, which struck him in the head and briefly rendered him unconscious.

During one incursion into Ko-Wahi, he found a beleaguered Takua and Matoro, under attack from a
   Muaka
   . Engaging the tiger Rahi, he initially used the
   Huna
   to land several unseen blows on its hide, drawing it to the edge of a cliff, then used a
   Mahiki
   to create two decoy replicas of himself. With the Rahi confused, Kopaka plunged his sword into the cliff, causing the hanging ledge on which the Muaka was perched to break away from the cliff, trapping the Rahi below.

Pohatu then sped them away with his Kakama and, Kopaka, trying to stop it the hard way, created a barrier of ice. Pohatu, however, sped around the cyclone opposite its direction of spin, cancelling out the cyclone's winds. They then thought about what had created the cyclone, but Kopaka thought that it was just a regular cyclone, for a Toa-created cyclone would have just jumped over the wall at the Toa's request.

They then discussed what they should do when Pohatu heard some noises in the trees. Pohatu wanted to take care of it, but Kopaka decided to freeze its wings, causing it to fall to the ground. The creature then told them that he did not know who killed Tren Krom. Kopaka and Pohatu learned that this creature's name was
   Gaardus
   ; he was once a Matoran, but experiments by the
   Nynrah Ghosts
   turned him into what he is now. The group then talked about their visions and how they could get to the Red Star and Gaardus told them that he could teleport to places he had been before.

Pohatu quickly disarmed the Kestora, and Kopaka eventually froze them. When Gaardus disappeared, they decided to look for another way out. They were then surrounded by more hostile inhabitants, before being saved by the Matoran Mavrah.

    Personality and Traits

  <p key="f190e9ee-e28b-42f8-97b8-16d61d54ce0f">
   Kopaka was serious, cold and analytical. He was a loner, preferring to go solo instead of teaming up. He would often be in rivalry with Tahu, their elements reflecting their different and conflicting natures.
  </p>
  <p key="577d252e-27b1-4733-ae40-375f821541b3">
   Kopaka often displayed his cold side, and to many it seemed like it was all there was in him. But if one would take the time to look a little deeper into his character, they would find a loyal guardian with a caring heart who was willing to risk everything to protect his home, Matoran, Turaga, and his brother and sister Toa. He was very protective of the Matoran, thinking that exposing them to danger was not the deed of a responsible Toa.
  </p>
  <p key="62f76b6a-828a-4d07-ab7e-25f245b2c4cc">
   Pohatu was possibly Kopaka's closest friend; he was the first of the Toa to encounter Kopaka, and when Pohatu was later thought dead, it was the only time Kopaka openly showed emotions. Kopaka also considers Lewa a good friend, as he worried about the Toa of Air when there was no sign of him on Bara Magna and swore to find his brother.
  </p>
  <p key="91cf440f-af19-40c6-8a07-e824c1d9b34c">
   Unlike some of the other Toa Nuva, Kopaka had changed very little. He still prefered to fight alone, given the opportunity, though he knew it was not a wise tactic against the Makuta. He and Tahu had settled many of their differences and Kopaka filled the role of deputy leader of the team.

   Akaku Nuva

   , normally doubled up as one long blade (unusual, as the other Toa Nuva held one weapon in each hand), and an enhanced version of the

   Kopaka was later given adaptive armor by Artakha. This armor allowed his body to shift into a state that suited the bearer's current environment. As a
   Phantoka
   , he was still technically a Toa Nuva. He was equipped with a
