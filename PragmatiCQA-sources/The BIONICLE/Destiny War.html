   The Botar look-alike spotted Axonn first, and tried to block him. A sweep of an armored fist sent him sprawling. Axonn was on top of the Toa in the flash of a heart light, axe blade at the intruder's throat.

  <p key="ca5d3f9c-765a-4f40-91a0-e81f08b518b5">
   "Who are you?" growled Axonn. "What do you want here? Talk!"

   "My name is

  </p>
  <p key="15d8e3c3-c780-4c59-9eaf-0c74cc037329">
   Krakua paid no attention to the remark. Instead, he said, "Come with us. Your presence is required on

   Before Axonn could object, the Botar type had come close and activated his teleportation power. The three of them vanished from Voya Nui, only to reappear in the Order of Mata Nui fortress on Daxia. Axonn had been there before, so its appearance was no surprise to him.

   "They let me out early for good behavior," Brutaka smiled. "But I'm the least of the shocking faces around here. This is it, my friend. The Order is about to come out of hiding after all these years. Helryx told me so herself."

   A cry made him look up. It came from a bat-winged Rahi wheeling through the sky, one not native to Odina. He recognized the creature as one bred for long distance flying. More than once the Dark Hunters had used them to send messages back and forth to agents on other islands. But the flying creature up above did not come from another Dark Hunter. As a half dozen more joined it, they began flying in a pattern recognizable to no one on the island but Ancient. It was a message intended for him, and one that was urgent. The time had come.

   One of the peculiar things about a Skakdi warlord's base is the lack of any kind of a dungeon, torture chamber, or prisoner of war camp. History has shown that there's very little point in torturing a Skakdi as they never talk except in trade, usually for their freedom, which few captors would agree to. And keeping prisoners means listening to them whine about trivial things like food, water, and a good-sized club to use on the Stone Rats who keep paying midnight visits.

   "Well, of course I did, but only to tell you that I won't!" said Vezon, exasperated. "How could this being hope to conquer the universe, and yet be so slow? It's all a trick, you see. They want me to pretend to betray them. They want you to concentrate your forces on an attack that won't come. But I decided: Why pretend to betray them when actually doing it would be so much more fun?"

   Axonn and Brutaka stood on a steep rise, overlooking a battlefield. Down below, the assembled might of the Skakdi of Zakaz were locked in combat with a small army of Rahkshi. The setting was an unnamed island in one of the southern chains, set up as a staging area by the Brotherhood of Makuta for an invasion of the mainland continent. The Rahkshi had been brought there in secret, and allowed to practice their skills on the scattered

   </a>
   residents. Needless to say, there were no longer any Matoran on this island. Initially, the Skakdi had suffered horrible losses, but they were capable of something the Rahkshi could only pretend to: rage. Hungry for victory, and filled with hatred for their enemy, the barbarians regrouped and tore through the Rahkshi ranks. It was overwhelming, thrilling, and sickening all at once.
  </p>
  <p key="b1f0236a-beff-4d8a-9496-57e92c674131">
   "Come on," said Brutaka, tearing himself away from the spectacle. "You know what we're here for." Together they walked down the hill and deep into a small canyon. In the center, buried beneath the soil and rock, was a square metal trapdoor with an iron ring. After Axonn split the rock with his axe, Brutaka grasped the ring and pulled open the door. A stench rose from within. The smell of age and neglect, decay and rot. The two Order of Mata Nui members climbed down into the hole.

  <p key="72eb7fc7-4552-407a-9334-59bdea81c6db">
   Axonn sent energy through his axe, illuminating the chamber. It was obvious that no one had walked here since perhaps the beginning of recorded time. The place was bare stone, with the only interesting feature a pool in the center. The waters were greenish-black and swirled angrily, despite there not being even the slightest breeze to stir them.

   The waters of the pool suddenly exploded up and outward. Foul, scalding liquid struck Axonn and Brutaka, seeping into the openings in their masks and armor. It hissed and writhed, like a thing alive, burning wherever it touched. Temporarily blinded and in pain, the two warriors staggered and then stumbled, plunging into the pool itself.

She could not be sure he would follow them, given their nature, or she would simply be trading the Brotherhood in the end for a worse evil. But it had to be done. Sometimes she hated being the one in charge.

   Now, as he surveyed his conquest, a few things captured his notice: the structure was not original, it had been rebuilt on the site of an earlier strong point. The lower levels were still incomplete, and it was while exploring them that he found a strange room. Deep below the basement was a room of rubble. The walls had been smashed, leaving only packed earth behind, and the remnants of those walls were littered around the floor. Intrigued, he picked one of the pieces up, only to find there was an inscription on it. The symbols made no sense to him and he was about to throw it away, when he noticed that another piece also had such an inscription. In fact, all the pieces did. There was some sort of message here, or there had been, he realized.

With the infinite patience of a born hunter, Pridak began to assemble the stones.

   Axonn was drowning. The greenish-black fluid filled his mouth and lungs before he could react. His mighty arms flailed about, trying to find something to grab on to, and failing. As he sank further toward the bottom, Axonn knew that here, in the birthplace of the Makuta species, he was going to die. Then he was suddenly rising rapidly up through the murky liquid. A strong hand had a hold of him and was yanking him away from his fate. A moment later he felt the hard stone of the floor beneath him. He choked and gasped. When the colors finally stopped swirling in front of his eyes, he looked up at his rescuer. Brutaka floated three feet off the floor. Green fire crackled from his eyes and the tips of his fingers. His armor had cracked in numerous places as the tissue it covered expanded. An aura of pure power surrounded him, so bright that Axonn had to raise a hand to protect his sight.

   Ancient
    climbed a low-rise, stepping carefully to avoid tripping over the rubble that was once a Xian factory. He had been searching for The Shadowed One for the better part of an hour. They were supposed to be discussing the defense of the city, but the Dark Hunter leader was nowhere to be found. He was concerned. Toa Helryx had asked Ancient, her spy within the Dark Hunters, for regular reports on the state of things at Xia and The Shadowed One's actions. She fully expected a Brotherhood of Makuta attack on the island, and he was already overdue with his latest dispatch. Ancient reached the top of the rise. The first thing he saw was The Shadowed One, standing amid a pile of debris. He was holding a small chest, which was open, and staring at the contents with a nasty smile on his face. As Ancient drew closer, he noticed two other things: a dead Vortixx on the ground, his face encased in Crystalline Protodermis; and just what was in the chest: three vials.
  </p>
  <p key="0a652600-b600-4b23-99d4-717cadb58087">
   "What have you found?" asked Ancient, "And why would a Vortixx be foolish enough to challenge you for it?"
  </p>
  <p key="ba653052-0ca9-4f71-b807-5848415a0e57">
   The Shadowed One looked up, surprised. Then seeing it was Ancient, he visibly relaxed.
  </p>

   "A most amazing thing," he said, "Have you ever heard of Makuta

  <p key="2a86a016-acd8-41be-9062-52265db7e996">
   Ancient nodded. He knew the story from the Order of Mata Nui: Kojol had been visiting Xia to discuss having a virus added into a weapon the Vortixx were building for the Makuta. During his visit, he was "accidentally" killed by a different virus. Except it was no accident, but an Order operation to remove him.
  </p>
  <p key="8daf1128-2f56-4741-a9a1-c138177e6ae0">
   "He brought a number of viruses with him when he came to Xia," The Shadowed One continued, "some were never found. The story was they were incinerated along with his armor. But they weren't, and I have found them."
  </p>
  <p key="0573c74b-5ba8-4b53-914f-7bae5e059569">
   Ancient tried not to look as worried as he felt. Weapons like this in the hands of the Dark Hunters was a disaster in the making.

   "Ransom them?" said The Shadowed One, "No, no, I intend to make use of them. I will learn what they are and what they do, and then Helryx and the Makuta will answer to me! But I will need time... a great deal of time and privacy to work. No one must know I have them. That is why the Vortixx here had to die. And it's why..."

   Vezon stalked through the halls of the fortress of Destral, following Makuta Tridax and doing his best to remain unseen. The walls of the ancient structure shook from a ferocious pounding: the Order of Mata Nui had launched its attack on the Makuta base at last. His mission was simple, purposely so that even his deranged mind could keep it straight: He was to follow Tridax, find the means the Makuta use to teleport their island from place to place, and then disable it. He would then be most likely killed by Tridax, but then no plan was perfect.
  </p>
  <p key="87226214-43f7-4018-88cc-492878666eed">
   At first it seemed as if all was proceeding as expected: Tridax made his way to a sub-basement, seemingly oblivious to being followed. At the bottom of the basement was a massive chamber. What waited within that chamber staggered even the deeply disturbed Vezon. The walls towered forty feet, all around. Lining them were
   stasis tubes
   , close to one-hundred. And each tube was occupied by an identical figure. A few had armor of jet-black, most white-and-gold, but it was obvious they were all the same being. They were in some kind of stasis. Tridax walked to the center of the room, where a small table sat. On the table was a Kanohi mask. Tridax reached for it, then suddenly whirled and hurled a blast of Shadow at Vezon. Before he could dodge, the shadow had pinned him to the wall.
  </p>
  <p key="67b6a82e-feb0-4eb6-b19a-60724587b938">
   "Did you think I could not hear your clumsy attempt to follow me?" said Tridax, "Very well, Skakdi trash. You want to learn the most powerful secret of Destral? You want the satisfaction of knowing what hides here before you die? Look around."

    Shadow Leech
    : a creature that could drain the Light of others and turn them into beings of Shadow. That was what sparked my idea. I knew the mask could not only reach other places of this dimension, but other realities as well. And so I have begun traveling to those realities and collecting the Toa Takanuva of each, bringing him back here, and feeding his Light to my pets. When I am done, I will have an army of Shadow Toa, all made from the most dangerous enemy of the Makuta."

  <p key="70aa1b8b-8a2b-40e5-ab61-efcfe52b0c8f">
   "No need," said Tridax. "I have only to release the Shadow Takanuva I have already made, and they will dispose of the attackers. And then I can go back to work in earnest. And then I can..."

   Tridax stopped at the sound of crystal shattering. Startled, he let his Shadow power lapse. Vezon slumped to the ground, but not before he saw the Makuta looking at his arm in horror. Something was dissolving his armored gauntlet before his eyes, and his Antidermis was leaking out into the air. Two beings stepped out of the shadows. One was a

   Toa Helryx, leader of the Order of Mata Nui, picked her way across the remains of a battlefield. She was on the beach of the island of Nynrah, site of a struggle between the Brotherhood of Makuta and the Order. After a long and furious battle, the Order had won. Driving the Brotherhood forces from the island or crushing them on the beach. Now she wandered the sands, occasionally picking up a piece of Rahkshi armor, studying it for a moment and then discarding it.
  </p>
  <p key="d16166d5-d44b-4b4d-b75d-41e04568b764">
   There was a method to her madness. Using her
   mask of power
   , Helryx could read the past of an object simply by touching it. Her goal here was simple: Rahkshi were created using a powerful substance called
   <a href="Energized Protodermis.html" key="5fa71a0c-d57b-417c-acbf-3dac95b1aee5" title="Energized Protodermis">
    Energized Protodermis
   </a>
   . The Order wanted to know every source of that substance used by the Makuta so they could capture or destroy those sources. Without them, no new Rahkshi could come into being.
  </p>
  <p key="75e8fa3d-e032-40ff-ab12-6bbe9c95aadd">
   So far, all the ones she had identified here were sources the Order already knew about. Still, it was worth the effort. It would be far easier to defeat the Brotherhood by cutting off their source of power, rather than beating them in battle.

  <p key="dfdbb882-5897-4c73-b44c-434d12c420a9">
   She picked up a piece of crimson Rahkshi armor and called on the power of her mask. This time, she saw a place she did not recognize. Makuta

   was there, and a silvery pool, but not just any pool, no, this one had a figure emerging from it. A being actually made of energized protodermis. She concentrated hard and the location came to her: an island just north of the one her newest ally came from.

   It was a short journey. Their destination had at first seemed uninhabited, but that illusion didn't last long. Helryx spotted... things skulking among the rocks. They weren't Matoran, or Rahi, but looked like something in between. The overall feeling was that something was very wrong here. The air, the ground, the inhabitants all felt off, somehow, in a way that obviously made Keetongu uneasy. There were no buildings on the island... none left standing, anyway. The most prominent feature was a large cave. Helryx and Keetongu entered cautiously. The passage narrowed considerably once they were a little ways in, forcing them to crawl to make any forward progress. Helryx couldn't help but think how easy it would be to get trapped in here.
  </p>
  <p key="40239083-5877-421e-863d-91742eaf9cce">
   As the passage widened again, Helryx saw more creatures. These obviously were Rahi beasts, but not like anything she'd seen before. They were short, pale bipeds, with large yellow eyes and spindly arms and legs. They backed away and moved to the side as she and her ally passed. But as soon as the two had moved on, they assembled into a group and followed close behind.

   Helryx and Keetongu came to a huge chamber. In the center of it was not a pool of energized protodermis, but an actual lake of the stuff. And rising from the center was the figure of a living being. A head, two arms, a torso ending in the lake itself. Its features were barely there, and its substance was the silver color of Energized Protodermis. The sight triggered a memory. An agent on Metru Nui had reported that

   There was no where to run. There was no where to hide. A tidal-wave of Energized Protodermis was headed right for Toa Helryx and Keetongu. When it struck them, it would do one of two things: transform them forever into who knew what, or destroy them both. Desperate, Helryx reached out with her Elemental power. Despite many thousands of years of honing her control over to perfection, it did no good. Energized Protodermis, though in liquid form, was not water and was immune to her abilities. Doom was coming in a great silver wave.

   Keetongu growled. Helryx glanced at him to see that his attention was directed behind them - specifically he was looking at a hole in space that had just opened. Thoughts raced through Helryx's mind. Had Brutaka come to save them? Where did this portal lead? But there wasn't time for answers, only escape. Grabbing Keetongu's wrist, she pulled him toward the hole. They dove in together with no idea of where they would emerge.

   At the same moment, a figure appeared in the portal. He stepped out into the chamber. If anyone had been present to see, they might have recognized him as the mad criminal Vezon, his face hidden behind a Kanohi Olmak, the mask of Dimensional Gates.

   Turaga Vakama walked slowly through the corridors of the Coliseum. It had been his work place since his return to the city of Metru Nui. Now it was his home as well, along with that of all the other Turaga. Much had changed in the city in recent days, not all of it good. Despite his confinement, he had been able to pick up snatches of information here and there. The fortunes of war had evidently turned against the Brotherhood of Makuta. Numerous Makuta-held islands had fallen including, rumor had it, Destral itself. It was almost too much to hope for - perhaps the Great Spirit would awaken to find his arch-enemies vanquished for good.

  <p key="446f4e09-cb27-44f8-8d13-e3f2385ea033">
   He passed his chamber and headed down a flight of stairs to a secure room. Here were kept weapons, memorials to the
    Toa Mangai
    , and one very important

   Mask. Although Vakama knew that it was one of the safest spots in the city, he still checked on it every day. If the contents of that room were to fall into the wrong hands... he didn't even want to think about it.
  </p>
  <p key="dc6fc078-6f46-41db-befb-58e1f9d7cd80">
   He was halfway down the stairs when he heard the crash. He raced down to find a half a dozen, heavily armed
    Ta-Matoran
    , scattered like leaves in a wind storm. The door to the chamber had crumpled with age, and stepping through it was a being Vakama had hoped to never see again. A little over a thousand years ago, when he was still a Toa, Vakama had battled a being called
   <a href="Voporak.html" key="8e86f5ff-422c-44ea-8f18-08095e380c55" title="Voporak">
    Voporak
   </a>
   . Surrounded by a field that aged anything it touched, Voporak seemed impossible to beat, and it took a Makuta to do it in the end. Voporak worked for the Dark Hunters and sought one thing in Metru Nui: the thing he now held in his great claw, the Kanohi Mask of Time.
  </p>
  <p key="f95c21cf-d994-44ca-8003-78bdb73319ea">
   Vakama froze. He wanted to attack, to avenge his fallen friends, but he knew that no attack of his would stop this creature. Voporak knew it too. He looked at Vakama with something like contempt. Then he shrugged and turned his back on the Turaga, walking away. Vakama followed. A few minutes later he watched Voporak walk out of a hole in the side of the Coliseum. A four-armed warrior wielding a multi-bladed axe bellowed at the sight of the thief and charged. Voporak reached out and grabbed his attacker. In a matter of seconds, the warrior aged tens of thousands of years before collapsing on the ground. Voporak kept going, and there was nothing, Vakama knew, that could hope to stop him.

   Kalmah moved warily through the main complex of Xia, flanked by Mantax and Ehlek. He did not want to be here. It would have been far more satisfying to be leading his new fleet against the Brotherhood of Makuta, but Pridak had contacted him and assured him that their old dream of overthrowing a Great Spirit might live again.
  </p>
  <p key="ea960e10-1738-4a99-9e1d-08ece3dec940">
   Up ahead, sitting on a makeshift throne was The Shadowed One, leader of the Dark Hunters. He eyed the three Barraki coldly. Perched on the rafters above was
    Darkness
    , who watched over The Shadowed One, though not out of any desire to guard him. No, Darkness waited for a sign of weakness in the leader, to kill him so another could take his place.
  </p>
  <p key="55441bd4-bf46-4da2-a6ca-6018d222a6e9">
   "Shadowed One, we bring you greetings from Pridak," said Kalmah. "And congratulate you on your seizure of this island."
  </p>
  <p key="cded6d35-cd6f-4213-8b48-1a8f3c610e4d">
   The Shadowed One simply nodded, his gaze never leaving Kalmah's hideous face.
  </p>
  <p key="7e1e48ff-b3b9-49ef-bcfe-20038a16f683">
   "It is Pridak's belief that the Barraki and the Dark Hunters would be well served by an alliance," Kalmah continued. "After this chaos is ended, someone will need to pick up the pieces of this universe. We see an opportunity."
  </p>
  <p key="013d8c4a-b0e5-46be-8927-c14b3dfaff2a">
   "And what do you have to bargain with, besides your fearsome reputations?" The Shadowed One said, mockery in his voice.
  </p>
  <p key="f879f2f4-d9ef-48d4-9db1-becb947fb387">
   Kalmah simply smiled. "Information. We know that Makuta Teridax struck the Great Spirit Mata Nui down, and we know how. We also know that a prototype of the virus used to do it was hidden on this island, and we believe you have it."
  </p>
  <p key="38507598-fa5f-4337-ab32-6aaf48d1cf01">
   "I?" Said the Shadowed One. "I am the humble administrator of Xia, a mere servant of the people. Nothing more."
  </p>
  <p key="6420b404-465c-4294-83c8-bd3271fb4f69">
   Kalmah laughed. "You, are a lying, treacherous sack of
    Doom Viper
    breath. But you are also very thorough. Oh yes, we've heard all about you and your organization since our release from captivity. If that virus is on Xia, you have it."
  </p>
  <p key="4e1a44ec-0712-4cb2-a631-1ebc958a7801">
   The Shadowed One's expression darkened. A lesser being would have quaked with fear at the sight. The Barraki, though, were not lesser beings.
  </p>
  <p key="3535cda4-dfd2-4cec-94d9-a64560d3af5d">
   "And if I do?"
  </p>
  <p key="c4fc1ab8-e938-4168-b0cd-6f324e167ac7">
   "You know where it is, we know how it can be used. And so, a bargain."
  </p>
  <p key="b2209b66-1b9f-473b-991d-fe1294968e84">
   The Shadowed One considered. He could just kill these three as he had Ancient, but if they really did know something about how the vials he had found could be turned against the Great Spirit, well, that was knowledge worth gaining. He could always kill them later, after all.
  </p>
  <p key="0c4af0d8-be38-4a4d-936d-211198bc348c">
   "On one condition," he said. "Pridak and I will meet on neutral ground, the land of Karzahni. If I am satisfied with what he has to offer, then, perhaps, Dark Hunter and Barraki will walk side-by-side into a new dawn."

   It took the Mahri a long time to make it back from Artidax back to Metru Nui. Jaller's first thought upon arriving is that it had been way too long. Metru Nui was under attack. At first he thought that was Metru Nui; it was surrounded by high walls with weapons mounted at the top of them, weapons belching fire and smoke at the attackers. The weapons were manned by warriors of all sorts, none of which Jaller recognized. Wait, Check that. The berserker battling three opponents at once looked a lot like Hewkii.
  </p>
  <p key="19acfc46-d970-45b1-b038-5908f2188de8">
   "What's going on?" said Nuparu. "Looks like we've we've walked into a full scale war."
  </p>
  <p key="fd1fc455-6ab6-4c23-8a9c-2793ee3996b1">
   "It's been going on for a while," said Hahli. "But I think it's come home."
  </p>
  <p key="0a7112ea-a31f-4e2d-af1e-eda16853f89c">
   It was an awesome sight. Ships flying the banner of the Brotherhood of Makuta ringed the island-city, flying Rahkshi were assaulting from every direction, firing bolts of energy from their staffs while others pounded on the walls. In one section, a portion of the wall had already crumbled, and warriors fought in the gap, trying to keep the invaders out.
  </p>
  <p key="6b8cd973-b179-475e-88a2-9b5c3f3e4cf8">
   "They're breaking through!" shouted Nuparu.
  </p>
  <p key="b0014124-b3ab-4cc0-a5b1-b188ca501203">
   "Let's go," said Jaller. "We stand or fall with our city."
  </p>
  <p key="ab83e048-2d74-4a8d-b7d5-bc2a1f9afdf0">
   The three Toa hit the gap from behind, using Fire, Water, and Earth to tear through the ranks of Rahkshi. They made it through the wall of the city. Beyond the ranks of Order of Mata Nui agents, they spotted a Turaga manning barricades.
  </p>
  <p key="2a43eeef-d51e-4ba0-bce0-7a6deaf7b9ef">
   Jaller rushed up to Vakama. "Turaga, what's happening, how did this battle begin?"
  </p>
  <p key="d6739d2f-2928-4f88-ab87-2ae2c0b615b4">
   "We can thank the Order for that," Vakama replied. "Now our problem is how to end it before the city is destroyed."
  </p>
  <p key="770c27d2-7989-4749-881e-b5fe9b17ad60">
   "The Mask of Time," said Hahli. "Can one of us use it to, I don't know, slow down the Rahkshi somehow?"
  </p>
  <p key="6210ba36-5810-4088-9325-2fdb359ee19b">
   "I wish you could," said Vakama. "But the mask is gone, stolen by a Dark Hunter. He made the gap in the wall you came through."
  </p>
  <p key="4c9b7641-04f5-4c23-a2e0-1f4803f34767">
   Jaller looked around. In his days as captain of the Ta-Koro Guard, he had learned a thing or two about battle strategy. A quick glance was enough to tell him that the Order had badly underestimated the ferocity of the Makuta attack. The Rahkshi had already gained the tops of the walls in three or four places, and in one southern section, had made it inside the walls as well. As he watched, the defenders of the gap fell back, and the invaders began pouring through.
  </p>
  <p key="b1430f96-160f-4ffb-b697-26bcb6b02922">
   "We need an edge," said Jaller. "Something the Rahkshi wouldn't expect."
  </p>
  <p key="42b7d477-e430-4804-8b5a-0451dbbf18d6">
   "There are more Toa coming, but they won't get here in time," said Vakama. "But there might be one Toa here now who could help us. Listen well..."
  </p>
  <p key="54f0ac38-38fe-44a1-bd11-68e677970cbb">
   It was Hahli who found the Toa in question, a Toa of Sonics named Krakua. When he heard Vakama's plan, he looked at her as if she had lost her mind.
  </p>
  <p key="c54ea2a0-01b5-4399-9da8-278b80a933ec">
   "Let me get this straight," he said, while blasting Rahkshi with sonic beams. "Vakama wants me to cycle through multiple frequencies until I find the one that will awaken something called the
   <a href="Bohrok.html" key="71212ae7-f7dd-4168-895e-f9f2b0945c1e" title="Bohrok">
    Bohrok
   </a>
   ?"
  </p>
  <p key="b5ccecde-46e0-4275-8713-406bcfacb50e">
   "Yes," said Hahli. "We know, well, we suspect, the signal that awakens them is sonic, but we don't know what it is or how to trigger it. If we can awaken the ones under Metru Nui, and if the Rahkshi try to get in their way, well, it might buy us some time for something else we're planning."
  </p>
  <p key="d96fd230-cb3f-41c5-b137-d1681d1886d9">
   "All right, I'll try," said Krakua. "No promises."
  </p>
  <p key="c93d4b65-65b7-4ee6-8267-005fec3c5146">
   Hahli left. Her next move was to be using her power to disturb the ocean to try to wreck the Makuta ships. But before she could do so, everything changed all around her. The stars brightened overhead, the breeze turned warm, the earth shook in a gentle tremor. She didn't know how, but somehow she was certain: the Great Spirit had awakened.
  </p>
  <p key="e3442d62-abe9-429b-af61-e0b0c729dc6b">
   Beyond the city walls, a storm rose, tossing the Makuta fleet about like toys. Yet that did nothing to deter the Rahkshi, who kept on coming. They had broken through the walls in four places and were rampaging through
   <a href="Ta-Metru.html" key="b52bc537-ab13-46e5-a1c3-33c14f54fa5c" title="Ta-Metru">

   . Nothing could stop them, it seemed. At least until the ground erupted in front of them and a horde of Bohrok emerged. It was not a large number, only those specimens that were asleep in the archives and the small nest below it, but it was enough. The Rahkshi attacked immediately, and the Bohrok responded. The two sides were locked in combat, and as they fought, the Mahri and the Order agents picked off Rahkshi at will. The battle seesawed back and forth, with the Rahkshi never realizing that all the Bohrok wanted was to get to the island of Mata Nui. Had the Rahkshi just gotten out of their way, the fight would have been over.
  </p>
  <p key="31eded8b-6854-4525-9921-16be30b66415">
   The city slowly shook from a series of explosions, an Order agent from atop the walls yelled, "Fliers! Incoming!" Hahli looked up to see three incredibly fast aircraft soar over the city, bank as one, and head back to where the ships waited. One slowed and dipped its wing to her, and she recognized Pohatu in the pilot's seat. The Toa Nuva had come home.
  </p>
  <p key="4582da71-6a25-464c-9051-ec31853e7951">
   Pohatu flew his vessel back out of the city to finish off the ships. Meanwhile,
    Lewa
    and

   dove, peppering the Rahkshi with blasts of light. The sight seemed to rally the city's defenders, who surged back toward the gaps in the walls, led by Jaller and Hewkii, they drove the Rahkshi back.
  </p>
  <p key="351d6ad5-314a-45a3-9d72-33ff3d6c5d7e">
   Finally, the storm was over. The Brotherhood ships had gone to the bottom of the Silver Sea, the walls around the city had been battered down, but the rubble was littered with dead Kraata and shattered Rahkshi armor. Those of the invaders that were intact had flown away, provided they could escape the blasters of the
   Jetrax
   ,
    Rockoh
    , and
    Axalara
    . Metru Nui was safe, and as the Toa Nuva confirmed, the Great Spirit had awakened. The power of the Brotherhood of Makuta was broken for all time. Turaga Dume and Turaga Vakama appeared side-by-side to announce that tomorrow would be a city-wide day of celebration in the Coliseum.
  </p>
  <p key="40f01036-3412-40fd-9aa9-a8db564d3173">
   But Hahli did not feel like celebrating, even now. She could not help but remember Matoro, who had given his life that Mata Nui might live. And despite all the wounded and the dying among the defenders, she could not help but feel it had all been a little too ... easy. True, there had been some unexpected help: the airships, the Bohrok, the storm. But they had faced an army of Rahkshi. Something told her they should not have won, at least not with so much of the city still intact. She smiled. Turaga Nokama would have chided her for worrying so much. No matter how things seemed, the Great Spirit was awake for the first time in over one thousand years. Light had triumphed over darkness, hadn't it? The Toa had achieved their destiny and saved the universe, hadn't they? And that meant all was well again. Nothing very bad could happen now, could it?
  </p>
  <p key="d5665ae5-1930-4ec2-b547-ec9220407dc7">
   Hahli turned to head toward
    Ga-Metru
    , humming a song Nokama had once taught her. One written long ago that spoke of hope for tomorrow. Perhaps, if not for the music, she might have heard the sound of dark laughter on the wind.
