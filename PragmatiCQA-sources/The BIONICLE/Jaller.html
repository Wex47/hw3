As Hahli went by, carrying Jaller's mask, Takutanuva stopped her and, taking the mask, gave up a fraction of his life force to bring Jaller back to life. Afterward, the weakened Takutanuva could no longer hold the gate open, and it fell on top of him, splitting him back into two separate beings. Makuta's armor was crushed, but Takanuva somehow survived. The Matoran then returned to the surface, and as the Turaga finally told their stories of Metru Nui, they prepared to sail back to the city.

   The first to find the two Piraka was Zaktan, and immediately a lengthy battle ensued. In the end, Brutaka's power was sent back to him, and the 777-step stairway leading to the
   Chamber of Life
   was revealed. When the Inika awoke, they realized that the Piraka had gone down the staircase, and followed them.

   As they walked down the staircase, the Inika encountered an incarnation of the Ignika in the form of Toa Lhikan, who warned them that they should turn back. The Inika refused, pointing out that the real Toa Lhikan would never abandon such a vital quest. Lhikan then disappeared, and the Inika continued.

The other Toa Inika all ended up similarly killing their opponents by accident, and after the battle were horrified to see the dead creatures transform into the corpses of none other than the

   who had created the stairway then told them that in order to go on, one of their number must die. Jaller felt that, as the team's leader, he should make the sacrifice, but the memory of his earlier death at the hands of a Rahkshi made him hesitate. Matoro volunteered, pointing out that he had never been a warrior or athlete like the others, and thus was the logical choice. He then was disintegrated in a beam of power, but was immediately restored to life afterward. The Toa were then allowed to continue, and hurried on.

   Umbra
   , who challenged the Toa alone. Possessing the ability to turn into an incredibly fast beam of light, the guardian quickly disarmed the Toa Inika, but Matoro came up with the idea of creating a mirror of

   They eventually arrived in a massive chamber with a river of lava flowing through it, where they saw the Piraka had set up an ambush on a bridge. The Toa stormed the bridge and drove off most of the Piraka, but were trapped when the bridge collapsed on them. They freed themselves, and went after the Piraka into the
   Chamber of Life

Jaller was hastily considering going into the lava to retrieve the Ignika attached to Vezon's head, a plan Hahli considered insane.

The Toa followed, pursued by the Piraka, until the mask plunged into the sea and disappeared. They then met up with Axonn and the rescued Toa Nuva, and, as the Nuva set off on a new mission, Axonn showed the Inika a passageway leading down through the
