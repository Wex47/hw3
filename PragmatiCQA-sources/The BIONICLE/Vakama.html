   and of six Matoran from each district who knew of their locations. The others did not trust Vakama's vision at first, but they ultimately decided that it was all they had to go on. Splitting up, each Toa went to their respective Metru in search of the Matoran Vakama saw.
  </p>
  <p key="99506507-bf63-4a5e-a2f6-4b7528d6c6c5">
   The Matoran Vakama saw from Ta-Metru happened to be

   , an acquaintance of his and rival mask-maker. Travelling to Nuhrii's home, he found the crafter to be absent, but noticed that one of the commemorative plaques Nuhrii made for each mask he made had been shattered. Reassembling the plaque, Vakama recognized the mask represented, as he had been there when Nuhrii made it.
  </p>
  <p key="636c587c-6966-471c-b120-753ebb9b2124">
   Wondering why Nuhrii had broken the plaque, Vakama travelled to the main forge in Ta-Metru, and asked Nuhrii's co-worker,
   Brander
   . However, Brander was skeptical of the Fire Toa's claim that he was Vakama, and gave him a test that only a mask maker of his caliber would pass. Detecting the flawless mask with ease, Brander decides to believe Vakama, and tells him that the mask depicted on the broken plaque had apparently turned out flawed, as Nuhrii had worked too fast in an attempt to outdo Vakama, and the frustrated crafter had sent it to the Great Furnace to be melted down.
  </p>
  <p key="9915d998-e359-45d4-9721-5450a0c09bc1">
   However, Brander then recalled Nuhrii later telling him that he had received a note from
   Ko-Metru
   saying that the mask had not been flawed after all, and Nuhrii had promptly rushed to the Great Furnace to save the mask.
  </p>
  <p key="8e305d12-5d09-43c3-afe4-e5e897247951">
   Following Brander's information, Vakama travelled to the Great Furnace, only to find the facility's protodermis vats being attacked by Morbuzakh vines. Vakama defeated them, but was intrigued by the fact that the vats were in that position to begin with, when they should have been out of the vines' reach. Examining the vat control room, the Toa of Fire found that the controls had been destroyed by an energy blast of unknown origin. The vat operator,
   <a href="Kapura.html" key="812164f9-eee0-4b14-8d4f-c40e8aa3bce1" title="Kapura">
    Kapura
   </a>
   , thanked Vakama for his help, and tells him that though Nuhrii had been to the Great Furnace, the mask he had been seeking had not yet arrived, and must have still been in the
   Protodermis Reclamation Yard
   . According to Kapura, Nuhrii had been acting odd, saying that even if he didn't find the mask he sought, he knew of a Kanoka disk that would make a far greater mask than any previously forged.
  </p>
  <p key="2451b279-a79b-4de1-a13a-4dee33acf349">
   Vakama's search for Nuhrii now moved to the Protodermis Reclamation Yard, which was filled with flawed masks ranging from slightly cracked to horribly mangled. Talking to
   Kalama
   , the eccentric caretaker of the place, Vakama learned that Nuhrii had indeed been here in search of the mask, but had found it flawed as originally believed. However, the mask-maker had then received a message telling him to meet the sender in an abandoned area of the district to receive the disk. Vakama ran to the abandoned district, and here he finally found Nuhrii buried under rubble. Vakama dug him out of the rubble and persuaded him to tell him where the Great Disk was located.
  </p>
  <p key="2786dcb4-b036-4ba1-9366-ebab653962f0">
   After meeting up back at the Great Temple, the Toa Metru decided to divide into three groups, each one consisting of two Toa and their respective Matoran. Vakama and Nuhrii teamed up with Onewa and
   <a href="Ahkmou.html" key="49b35df5-ea0e-4ad8-9ba4-65a383222f9d" title="Ahkmou">
    Ahkmou
   </a>
   , and first sought Vakama's Great Disk in Ta-Metru. According to Nuhrii, the disk was located in one of the
   Fire Pits
   of the district, and a shortcut through the Protodermis Reclamation Center would bring them directly to the Pits. However, the Toa of Fire and Stone were ambushed and rendered unconscious by Nidhiki, and fell onto a chute that led directly into a furnace. Before the two could be incinerated alive, however, Vakama awakened in time to become aware of their imminent peril, and absorbed the heat of the furnace into his body. Eventually reaching the fenced-off Pits, Vakama made an entrance by melting a hole in the fence just big enough for him and Nuhrii to pass through. Using handholds Vakama melted into the side of one pit, the two descended quickly so as to avoid the intermittent fire eruptions, and found the Great Disk wedged into a crack in the side. Vakama retrieved it, but as they tried to climb out of the fire pit, Morbuzakh vines reached out from the pit's bottom and ensnared them. Fortunately, Vakama had one last normal disk on hand, and told Nuhrii to reach his launcher and fire the Kanoka - a "regenerate at random" type - at the vines strangling them. The disk ended up randomly turning the vines into a thorn-covered monster, but the shock of the shift was enough for it to let go of Vakama and Nuhrii, and the two narrowly escaped with the Great Disk right before the fire pit erupted.
  </p>
  <p key="acb510ff-e7fe-48cc-a536-253f1083b31c">
   Afterward, the four travelled to Po-Metru, where Onewa's Great Disk was said to be found on a "mountain in balance".
  </p>
  <p key="8660a9d8-07a3-4143-94f0-d6dc82283042">
   With all the Disks found,
   Vhisola
   told Vakama and the others that, according to her research, the
   <a href="Morbuzakh.html" key="cd7488b7-f3f4-472a-9fa4-36c92e766002" title="Morbuzakh">
    Morbuzakh
   </a>
   could be stopped by destroying its King Root. Having noticed the plant's dislike of cold earlier, the Toa figured that the King Root must be in the Great Furnace. Knowing this, the group headed to Ta-Metru.
  </p>
  <p key="e9e00466-599b-4b71-b8d1-a31073b42e97">
   Inside the heart of the furnace, the Toa were shocked to find that the Morbuzakh could communicate telepathically; it explained its plan to take over the city. After using up nearly all their elemental power fighting, the Toa eventually lured the Morbuzakh into drawing them in closer, where they unleashed the powers of the Great Disks. The Disks' power created an energy sphere that cut the Morbuzakh off its vines and killed it. With the Morbuzakh defeated, all its vines throughout the city disintegrated. The Toa managed to escape the Great Furnace before it collapsed.

Unfortunately, Dume rejected their gifts of the Great Kanoka Disks and insisted that they pass a grueling physical test in which the Coliseum's floor was activated rising and falling like waves of the ocean before they would be recognized as heroes. With their elemental power drained and their mask powers still inaccessible, the Toa suffered a humiliating defeat. "Dume" ordered that the "impostor" Toa be arrested. Vakama, Nokama, and Matau were able to escape, but Nuju, Onewa and Whenua were captured and thrown into the
   Prison of the Dark Hunters
   . Meanwhile, Vakama saw the Dark Hunters with Dume and realized that the three were working together.

   Vakama, Nokama and Matau eventually met up with Onewa, Whenua, Nuju and a Turaga in the tunnels under Po-Metru. The Turaga revealed himself to be Lhikan, whose power was drained by the others' transformation into Toa. Lhikan asked if the "heart of Metru Nui" was safe. When Vakama was confused by the question, Lhikan explained that the "heart of Metru Nui" was the Matoran. Soon afterwards, the Toa found a silver sphere with the real Turaga Dume inside, unmasked and unconscious. With all realizing that someone else has taken control of the city while pretending to be Dume, they quickly headed to the Coliseum.

Unfortunately, Vakama wasn't able to control its power well enough, and he ended up slowing time to a crawl for both of them. Teridax had launched a deadly blast that Vakama would never be able to dodge when Turaga Lhikan appeared and jumped in the way, sacrificing himself for Vakama. While Makuta went after the Vahi (which had been knocked off Vakama's face from the impact), Lhikan told Vakama how proud he was to have called Vakama a "brother". Spurred on by Lhikan's last words, Vakama activated his
   mask

   Arriving at the planet's surface, the Toa found a lush tropical island and named it Mata Nui, after the Great Spirit. They each explored the island, looking for good sites to found villages for their respective Matoran. Vakama came across a volcanic region he would dub Ta-Wahi, and decided that one location in the shadow of its great volcano would be ideal for the Ta-Matoran to settle once they were awakened. At Vakama's suggestion, the Toa created new Toa Stones so that replacement Toa could come if they failed.

   on a raft of transport parts and dead Karzahni branches, the Toa Metru found a city very different from the one they left: the bioquake during the cataclysm had not only damaged several of the buildings, but also freed most Rahi from where they had been kept in the Archives. Even more unsettling were the numerous green spider webs covering the city from top to bottom. Nevertheless, Vakama (believing he had failed the Matoran by allowing their capture and Lhikan by not preventing his death) had become dead-set on rescuing the Matoran and, despite their uneasiness, none of the other Toa would object enough to dissuade him from marching them directly to the Coliseum.

  <p key="90ca7946-c1ea-459c-96ee-5c220be2f716">
   The bestial Toa, however, agreed that the Matoran came first, so they would deal with their mutations later. To that end, they formed a plan to build airships that would bring the Matoran to Mata Nui and began scouring the city for transport parts and other supplies they would need. However, they not only had to fight against the Visorak hunting them down, but each had their own problems with their new feral sides. Vakama took the mutations especially hard, as he saw them as the latest in a long string of failures. In the meantime, Roodaka placed information where the Toa would find it: information that stated how Nuhrii, Vhisola, Ahkmou and the other Matoran that knew the place of the Great Disks were the ones meant to be Toa, but that Teridax had influenced Lhikan to change his mind so that the destined heroes would never gain power.
  </p>
  <p key="b04d18db-82e0-4ba0-a0f2-711b4f3e3eff">
   Feeling like an impostor as well as a failure (and not being helped by the other Toa's complaining about their situation and his leadership), Vakama briefly considered abandoning them and trying to rescue the Matoran himself, but realized how futile it would be. At that point, Roodaka abducted him and offered him nothing less than command of the Visorak horde. Already starting to resent his fellow Toa due to their constant criticisms and their harshness with him, Vakama saw a chance to take a well-trained army and command them to release the Matoran, and Roodaka encouraged him with the idea that leadership meant blind obedience of the followers, as opposed to the stubborn opposition that the other Toa often gave. Giving in to his Rahi side, the Toa Hordika of Fire accepted the position, but Roodaka knew Sidorak would not be so easily sold on the idea. She had Vakama kidnap the Rahaga (save

   , who was left behind to "send a message") as proof of his intentions and, by sweetening the deal with acceptance of Sidorak's long-denied marriage proposals and promises of the other Toa Hordika becoming commanders, Roodaka got Sidorak to welcome Vakama into the army.
  </p>
  <p key="b8ab84cc-6d4a-4783-86bf-dbf46ff771bc">
   Meanwhile, the Rahaga and Toa Hordika decided it was time to pick up the search for Keetongu, as it might be the only way to save Vakama. Once the Rahaga were captured, Norik took the information they had found and led the Toa to a mountain of ice hidden deep within Ko-Metru, where they found the not-so-mythical Rahi. After Keetongu heard their tale and how they wanted to help their friend, he agreed to join them- but he would not cure them of their mutations yet. They would need them in the upcoming battle.

  <p key="05451045-0661-4ed9-85bb-3f7a570a24f7">
   Together, the Toa Hordika, Norik and Keetongu stormed the Coliseum. While Norik freed the other Rahaga and Keetongu went after Sidorak and Roodaka, the Toa fought off the Visorak in search of the Matoran- except for Matau, who went off on his own to face Vakama who was now acting more and more like an animal. At the top of the Coliseum's highest spire, Matau tried to talk down Vakama apologizing for doubting his capability as a leader, reminding him of the Toa's friendship and their strength in unity- even as Vakama tried to kill him. Only when the Toa Hordika of Air was close to falling to his death did his words got through, and as Matau lost his grip and started to plummet to the Coliseum floor below, Vakama leapt down and caught him, using Visorak webbing as a bungee cord to keep them from impacting.
  </p>
  <p key="bbb33de0-36ff-418d-b58b-59789c39eb0d">
   Meanwhile, the other Toa found the Matoran - only to be confronted by Roodaka, who had gotten rid of Sidorak and was now sole leader of the Visorak. Matau joined the face-off and led the other four Toa in blasting Roodaka with their Rhotuka spinners. Vakama also entered the fight, seemingly on the side of Roodaka, but he turned on her and threatened to fire his own Rhotuka. Roodaka warned that she would order the Visorak to kill them if she died, but her rule was not as complete as she thought; Vakama was still the horde's commander and he gave the order to disband. As Roodaka was a traitor who brought their King to his death and because the Visorak hated Roodaka, the Visorak complied and Roodaka was left alone. Vakama made good on his threat to fire his Rhotuka, but Norik realized too late that she carried a
   piece
   of Teridax's prison: since it had now absorbed all six elemental powers, the prison's seal was broken and Makuta was free again.

   But Teridax left the Toa alone for the time being and, with the Toa Hordika cured and becoming Toa Metru again, they, the Rahaga and Keetongu all worked together to finish the airships they were building and load them with the Matoran, preparing to bring them to their new home of Mata Nui.

   The Toa were cured and the Matoran saved, but there was still one thing to take care of: the Mask of Time was still out there somewhere and could be extremely dangerous if in the wrong hands. Vakama went off on his own to retrieve it, asking the others to stay behind in case Teridax went after the Matoran. He found it on the ocean floor, but was quickly knocked out when a waterspout launched him into the Great Barrier - though not before a strange being came and took the mask from him.

   Vakama woke up in a different world than what he remembered: Metru Nui had never fallen, but was still threatened by the Morbuzakh. Lhikan was still alive, but as a Turaga ruling alongside Dume. Moreover, Vakama was no longer a Toa; it was Nuhrii who had been empowered in his place. Vakama started to think that perhaps the Vahi had changed the past so that Lhikan had gone with his original choices for Toa Metru. But upon talking with Nuju and Nokama (who were also Matoran again), he found that this world wasn't necessarily better: the Toa Metru here were encouraging and enforcing stricter laws; plus Onewa had been traumatized by Toa Ahkmou and the Vahki, and Matau had been killed in a Morbuzakh attack. But every now and then, Vakama would briefly see the empty, ruined city that he remembered.

  <p key="3d7a759e-9ff5-4c07-b081-bc9c154520c8">
   Working with Nokama, Vakama searched for information on the Mask of Time. He first found a carving of the being who took the mask from him, identifying it as a Dark Hunter servant called

   , who warned him that in order to save the future, he must be willing to destroy it. Coming out of his vision - Turaga Lhikan had arrived and pried the hybrid off - Vakama acted on his suspicions and flung a Kanoka right at Nokama's head. When it passed through, it proved to Vakama that what he was seeing wasn't real and made the illusion disappear completely. Vakama was a Toa as he had always been, "Nokama" had been actually a

   Having failed to trick Vakama into handing over the Vahi, the Makuta resorted to threats, but was infuriated to find that Voporak had taken the mask. He decided to propose a truce: that he and Vakama would work together to get the mask from the Dark Hunters and then fight between themselves over it. Vakama reluctantly agreed. The two split up at the Great Temple; while Vakama faced the Hunter named

   , Makuta was challenged by Keetongu. He was badly beating the Rahi, until Vakama caused an explosion in desperation that not only knocked Sentrakh out, but blew Makuta away from the Temple, sparing Keetongu's life. Unfortunately, he was immediately faced with not only Voporak but also Sentrakh's boss,

   , who now held the Vahi and wanted to punish the Toa responsible for killing Nidhiki and Krekka. To make matters worse, Makuta returned and started bargaining with the Shadowed One over the mask. Vakama decided to play the two against each other, explaining that Teridax was the one who killed the two Hunters. The Shadowed One and Voporak immediately started fighting Makuta, and the winning side would claim the Mask of Time- if Vakama hadn't grabbed it out of the Shadowed One's hands.

   On the way out of the city, Vakama's jetpack was damaged and he was saved from certain death by the resprouted Karzahni plant. Though Karzahni had been helping Teridax, playing the part of the Morbuzakh in the illusion, it switched sides and helped Vakama by telling him the truth: Lhikan's original choices for Toa Metru were wrong. Makuta would never allow new Toa to arise that could threaten him, so Mata Nui and
   <a href="Order of Mata Nui.html" key="8d9cd7fa-b435-4f6e-bf7b-b478429fa050" title="Order of Mata Nui">

   </a>
   made false prophecies and evidence to deceive Teridax into thinking Lhikan's choices were correct; and Teridax responded by influencing Lhikan to choose six others. But Mata Nui himself had influenced Makuta's choices; ensuring that the true destined Toa Metru would indeed gain their power.
  </p>
  <p key="8d603e47-7eac-4297-bc98-d22e876a6eff">
   The conversation was cut short, however, by Makuta arriving and killing Karzahni again. Vakama escaped and, taking Krakua's and Karzahni's words to heart, prepared to stand his ground and face Teridax. When Makuta caught up with him, Vakama threatened to destroy the Mask of Time, warning that he had observed its power leaking out when it was slightly damaged earlier- meaning its complete destruction could have far graver consequences. Once Teridax was convinced that Vakama really would risk the mask's destruction, he reluctantly accepted Vakama's demands: safe passage out of the city for himself, safety for his allies in Metru Nui, and peace for the Matoran- though the Makuta only agreed to one year of peace before he would return.
  </p>
  <p key="1c4b2501-72df-465c-acd7-33732ec5dd28">
   With that, Vakama returned to the other Toa Metru and the Matoran on Mata Nui, telling them only that he got the Vahi and found they were the true destined Toa Metru; he said nothing of the rest as he feared the others would want to provoke a war with Teridax. On the shores of Mata Nui, the Toa Metru gave up their power to awaken the Matoran, becoming the Turaga who would lead them in starting their new lives.

After Takua collected all the Toa stones, Vakama joined the other five Turaga at Kini-Nui and thanked Takua. Afterward, Takua placed the six stones in a circle at the

The Turaga then told Tahu of his mission, and of the masks of power he had to recover in order to defeat Makuta. Shortly after the Toa left on his quest, an amnesiac Takua returned to Ta-Koro, and when he entered the Turaga's hut Vakama told him of Tahu's arrival. As the Toa were preparing to travel into the

   Vakama was known for his great courage and his kindness. Vakama as a Toa was not certain he was ready for the role of a hero. At times he missed his old life in the foundries, crafting masks for others to wear. Vakama was plagued by strange visions of the future; often their meaning was not clear, and it was a "talent" he hid from others. Later he discovered that the visions he had were the key to saving Metru Nui. Although he led the Toa Metru, he was unsure of himself, and didn't know if he wanted that role. During his time as a Hordika, because he was the most driven of the Toa Metru, succumbed to his Hordika side first. Nokama, however, felt strongly that Vakama was the best suited to lead the Toa Metru something that none of the other Toa shared. He had a close friendship with Nokama.

   He later, as a Turaga, had trouble trusting the Toa Mata, stemming from the betrayal of "Turaga Dume" (Makuta in disguise) and his own mistakes as a Toa Metru. Because of this, he usually divulged information only need-to-know basis to his fellow Matoran and Toa, which annoyed Nokama, who believed that the Toa Mata should know the truth. Though he also felt that it would be cruel to remind the Matoran of a home they might never see again, something that the other Turaga agreed with.
