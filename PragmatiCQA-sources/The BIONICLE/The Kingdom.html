  <p key="b12d5ee3-bef7-4ffe-abaf-ed84f4c90375">
   Somehow, though, this trip was not going as planned. Takanuva was being buffeted about, catching glimpses now and then of weird other worlds filled with beings both familiar and unfamiliar. He could guess that if he somehow wound up in one of those places, he might never find his way back to his own universe.
  </p>
  <p key="0d8fb49e-9dcc-449b-97f5-93b0bacd329d">
   Suddenly, there was a jolt worse than any before. He was spinning wildly, out of control. There was an instant of complete darkness, followed by a very bright light, and then Takanuva slammed onto a rocky shore. He lay there, stunned, for a long time. When he finally lifted his head, it was to view a sight he could never have imagined.

   Takanuva glanced up at the sky. No, it didn't look like the one over Metru Nui. It looked – oh, no, that couldn't be, he thought. It was the same shade of blue as the one over the island of

   It took some doing, but he finally convinced Macku to escort him into the city, which she called "the kingdom of the Great Spirit." The first person she brought him to was a

   Takanuva thought about telling Jaller the truth. He could share all sorts of things only the real Takanuva would know. But then he decided that, at best, he would scare his old friend ... and at worst, he would wind up arrested by the Hunters.

  <p key="ed08245c-1adc-4ee0-9fd6-85e177f8ff1f">
   The name startled Takanuva. Matoro was dead, killed when he sacrificed his life to save the Great Spirit Mata Nui and the universe. A theory was starting to form in the mind of the Toa of Light, and the Wall of History was where it could be proven or disproven. He thanked Jaller and hurried on.
  </p>
  <p key="4075d6be-e4d6-48af-b34b-96231f2f17da">
   Yes, it was all there all right. The first thing he noticed was the date – it was 10,000 years after he had left Metru Nui! But that wasn't half as surprising as the story the carvings told.
  </p>

   The Toa Mahri had journeyed to the underwater city of

    Mask of Life
   </a>
   , just as he recalled. But after that, the story had changed. Toa Matoro - referred to in the carvings as the "Disgraced One" – had hesitated a few moments too long in his pursuit of the mask. The core of the universe had been sealed off, making it impossible for him to revive the Great Spirit Mata Nui with the mask. And Mata Nui, ruler and protector of the entire Matoran Universe, had died.
  </p>
  <p key="de879257-8ac0-488f-ad94-e26850130003">
   But the tale didn't end there. The Turaga of Metru Nui had been planning for just such an eventuality. Mobilizing the Toa, the Vortixx, the Skakdi, and many of the universe's other species, they led a mass migration to the surface over the course of a few days. The
   <a href="Order of Mata Nui.html" key="771831df-b543-4604-9dc9-a60bd60f4444" title="Order of Mata Nui">
    Order of Mata Nui
   </a>
   revealed its existence and helped as well. Even as more and more beings poured from Metru Nui up to the Mata Nui, those who were already there worked to construct floating platforms to hold them all. Naturally, not everyone made it – it just wasn't physically possible to evacuate a universe in that short an amount of time – but many did. It was obvious that only by working together could they survive on the surface, and so the concept of the Kingdom was born.

   had refused to evacuate, choosing death over accepting assistance from Matoran. The Makuta attempted to migrate, only to find their way barred by Toa Takanuva and the Order. Together, they drove the Makuta back underground, and no sign had been seen of them since. His destiny achieved, Takanuva had sacrificed his power to bring a new generation of Toa into being.

   , and a
   Nynrah Matoran
   . Dark Hunters had become the primary law enforcers, while Toa were put to work using their powers to help the city in other ways. First, they prevented the collapse of the original island in the wake of Mata Nui's death. Then they created new and more stable land masses to support the city's expansion. After 10 millennia, the Kingdom was now a mega-city and home to all the survivors of the original universe.

   Turaga Takanuva and his Council ruled from the Coliseum. Toa Takanuva not only couldn't resist paying a visit to his other self, but he needed to find some way out of here. The Wall had shown him he had not simply traveled into his future somehow. This was not his universe at all.

  <p key="70db2a15-9a97-4c13-ac01-961581eacd78">
   As he walked, he had to admit that part of his wished he didn't have to leave. Who would have imagined that Matoro's failure would have resulted in a paradise like this? Everywhere he looked, he saw beings of different species working side by side. Only Toa and Hunters carried weapons, but they looked like they hadn't been used in ages.

   He expected to find the Coliseum heavily guarded, but the opposite was the case. The seat of government was open to all in the Kingdom. Instead of asking to see Turaga Takanuva, though, he sent a message to Helryx. It was short, reminding her of what her original plan had been to warn the Toa Nuva about conditions in Karda Nui and asking if she could get him in to see the Turaga.

   "Maybe it was an accident," Turaga Takanuva offered, sounding as if he didn't believe it himself. "Maybe one slipped through before the light barriers went up and has been hiding here all this time."

   Turaga Takanuva led Toa Takanuva out of the Coliseum and into the eastern portion of the vast city. Toa Tanma trailed along behind, not saying much. He wasn't sure whether to be grateful another Toa of Light had arrived to help him, or upset that the Turaga didn't think he could handle the job on his own.
  </p>
  <p key="09b7c815-4782-4b9e-96b2-fae065418e55">
   They arrived at a small, narrow building in an alleyway, not far from the shore. There was no knob or handle on the outside of the front door, nor any carving to indicate who lived there. Turaga Takanuva rapped twice with his staff.
  </p>
  <p key="534ba532-84cb-4fe3-91fd-84464f52c8d1">
   A small panel opened about halfway up the door. No eyes were visible through it, but a Matoran voice said, "What's the password?"
  </p>
  <p key="3eb27061-def3-4c5e-95e5-eaa91064a08f">
   Turaga Takanuva looked at the two Toa. "They've lived among us for ages, and still like to play at secrecy." Turning back to the door, he said, "This is Turaga Takanuva. Open up."

  <p key="e86c845f-27e1-4b21-8a5e-68fc6c02a377">
   There was a pause. Then the voice said, "Close enough," and the door swung open.

  <p key="71821299-e9f4-4d0d-9f49-cc6b678a0ae3">
   The three visitors entered a dark hallway, which twisted and turned far more than one would expect, given the size of the building. A door at the end led to a small workshop, cluttered with all sorts of armor, weapons, and other gadgets. A lone Fe-Matoran was tinkering with a nasty looking projectile launcher when they walked in. He looked up at Turaga Takanuva, surprised and annoyed.

   Once they were back on the street, Tanma wanted to head right for the nearest light barrier, but Toa Takanuva held him up. "There's something I want to do first," said Takanuva. "I want to see Matoro."
  </p>
  <p key="0e2ba230-b282-41d0-bf34-9b8d4ad8deef">
   "That coward?" spat Tanma. "If not for him, we would still have our homes, our universe. You can go see him if you like – I want nothing to do with him."
  </p>
  <p key="9b216225-76c7-4419-be20-5dbddf4259dd">
   Takanuva expected that Matoro would be living in the region inhabited by the

   Takanuva, overcome with emotion, had to stop talking. Here was Matoro, who was dead in his universe, having sacrificed himself to save Mata Nui and every other living thing. Here he was, alive, but dead inside, knowing he had failed his people when it mattered most.

  <p key="5942d081-9bc3-46fb-83ac-88efe08aad2a">
   They had walked perhaps a kio when the tunnel brightened. Tanma pointed ahead to a wall of light in their path. "That's the barrier. It's still intact. So the problem isn't here.

   , maybe? Or some other access point we don't know about?"
  </p>
  <p key="4367671f-5581-41fd-bb7f-42871a4e0cda">
   "Perhaps," said Takanuva. "But what if Matoro's right? What if the barrier simply isn't stopping them anymore?"
  </p>
  <p key="28b314f2-fe28-42eb-89c3-25e879071330">
   "I don't have time for Matoran myth," said Tanma. "We have to check other possibilities. Are you coming or not?"
  </p>
  <p key="695f52ab-5c74-491e-b9a8-3c9b88cc33a5">
   Takanuva glanced at the barrier, at Matoro, and then back at Tanma. "All right."
  </p>
  <p key="e34fac16-100d-46ab-9d2f-ff144fef1329">
   The two Toa of Light started back up the tunnel. Neither noticed Matoro wasn't following until they heard the sound of ice blasts coming from behind them. Takanuva turned and ran back down, followed closely by Tanma.
  </p>
  <p key="303e49c6-3b44-4436-be69-1cd821e4d853">
   There was Matoro, battling four Rahkshi on his own. Behind them, more were breaching the barrier, each clad in armor made of deep shadow. The armor couldn't survive the passage through the barrier, dissolving not long after making contact with the light. But it lasted just long enough to get the Rahkshi through to the other side.
  </p>
  <p key="ea941d00-1a06-47c1-aa45-956152b9cc12">
   Takanuva and Tanma both dropped to one knee and opened fire with their light powers. Takanuva's power lance took out two Rahkshi, while Tanma drove a third back into the barrier, where its kraata burned to ashes. Matoro froze the fourth in a block of ice up to its head, just long enough to reach in and yank out its kraata. He threw the squirming creature on the ground and stepped on it.
  </p>
  <p key="4304e86e-0a9d-4a2c-ae1e-649c60beb761">
   "Excellent," said a soft, sinister voice, which seemed to come from every shadow. Takanuva knew it well – it belonged to

   and their hordes."
  </p>
  <p key="ba4ddb53-594f-49f3-8e1d-29a73ba984f8">
   "You," said Matoro, his voice shaking. "Why aren't you dead? So many others died ... why not you?"
  </p>
  <p key="49ccd752-d2a4-49f5-a2b0-f60faea81d4d">
   "What is there left when the light dies, Toa? Darkness. Only darkness," Makuta replied. "And I thrive in the dark. Oh, my brothers perished, one by one ...

   was the first, driven from his body by my attack so I could possess it, his essence left to die in the cold of the void ... but my hatred will not let me die. Hatred of Mata Nui; hatred of all who escaped the end of this universe; most of all, Matoro, hatred of you ... you turned away from your destiny. Mata Nui was meant to cheat death ... instead, I was cheated of my revenge.”
  </p>
  <p key="ade70b8f-def7-469a-8191-50208713aee4">
   Now the Toa heard a clanking of armor, as if a colossus were coming toward them. The next moment, a 20-foot giant clad in shadow armor erupted from the barrier. As the shroud of shadow fell away, they could see their foe. He was a bizarre amalgam of the Makuta who had attacked Karda Nui and others who were unfamiliar. He was a monstrosity, now truly as ugly on the outside as his spirit was within.
  </p>
  <p key="1f8f4bd4-cd4b-49b9-a93c-6b09504d3233">
   "As my brothers were about to die, I absorbed them into my body," said Teridax. "I used their mass to grow. I used their knowledge to create armor to pierce this barrier. And now your Kingdom will surrender, or it will suffocate in a sea of shadow."
  </p>
  <p key="6bf09afb-5adb-495b-b6ec-5d5b203d1b32">
   Tanma, Matoro, and Takanuva attacked. Bolts of ice and spears of light rained on Teridax's armor, but the damage was negligible. "I have had 10,000 years to prepare for this battle," the Makuta hissed. "You cannot win."
  </p>
  <p key="2a2dfdb1-1e1c-471f-b1e6-02a6cf9e5866">
   "Excuse us if we try," said Takanuva, blasting with his power lance directly at the

   . The blow knocked the mask off. Makuta bent to retrieve it, but Tanma was too fast, hitting it with full power and melting it to slag.
  </p>
  <p key="1b319390-bf7a-447c-ba6d-1a1b37deff47">
   "Tanma, get back!" Takanuva shouted. It was too late. Makuta had scooped up the Toa of Light like a toy and triggered the shattering power of a Panrahk. Takanuva had to look away – it was simply too horrible to watch.
  </p>
  <p key="282b4832-af9e-4d44-9a00-bb440ff00c03">
   "Now do you see?" said Makuta. "You must --"
  </p>
  <p key="18dac2cf-3323-4285-999b-73982e16309f">
   Makuta stopped dead. Then he smiled at Takanuva. "Oh, I see ... oh, how intriguing. You are from ... somewhere else ... somewhere ... where Matoro died, and Mata Nui lived. The Plan proceeds there to its inevitable conclusion. Did you flee, then, Takanuva? Did you have the wisdom to escape before my reign begins?"
  </p>
  <p key="fa5dd8dd-ba50-48d8-8233-c8cd3b2f31b7">
   "I ... died?" said Matoro quietly.
  </p>
  <p key="5145cbe1-c001-43a1-9413-f3a47049cd65">
   "Yes," Takanuva replied. "You did. You gave your life so billions could live. In my universe, you are considered the greatest hero ever to bear the title of Toa."
  </p>
  <p key="0c1dd977-2681-422e-9847-6cb90b080452">
   "And here you are just one more insect to be crushed," said Makuta, advancing. "Or perhaps ... there is some other use for you. The Mask of Life still exists, and you were connected to it ... you have knowledge I can use, Toa of Ice."
  </p>
  <p key="00efbf4f-7faa-45f3-80d5-bae805e488e4">
   A hand made of shadow emerged from Makuta's chest, heading right for Matoro. Takanuva made a move to get between them, but the Toa of Ice hit him with a barrage of ice shards, driving him back.
  </p>
  <p key="863f7d53-a1e1-41ab-9ed5-61f269b029c8">
   "Matoro, what are you doing?" Takanuva cried out. "He's going to kill you!"
  </p>
  <p key="c43a2502-31c1-4979-9fd5-db4bd462a712">
   "I should have died 10,000 years ago," Matoro said. He stood erect, hands at his sides, waiting for the hand to seize him. "I should have saved everyone, but I didn't. If you think about it, Takanuva, neither of us is meant to be here."
  </p>
  <p key="4101567a-29df-468c-8f8f-9037957e15e8">
   The shadow hand took Matoro in its grasp and drew him, unprotesting, into the substance of Makuta. Takanuva got to his feet, blasting light from his power lance and shadow from his other hand, screaming, "Murderer!"
  </p>
  <p key="ca828099-41e8-4990-ba7c-0551f3a4058d">
   Strangely enough, Makuta did not counterattack. In fact, the colossus actually looked a bit unsteady on his feet. He took a step back, reached out an armored hand to support himself, then dropped to his knees. Both hands went to the side of his head, as he shouted, "No! My will must prevail! I am the stronger! I am --"
  </p>
  <p key="eca02ff7-f68a-440a-8ba5-795527c5888d">
   Then another voice came from Makuta's mouth. It was Matoro's! "No, Makuta. You once told the
   <a class="mw-redirect" href="Toa Mata.html" key="3bcbb70f-d29b-43ed-9f41-fbe1cd356f6d" title="Toa Mata">

   </a>
   that you could not be destroyed, because you were nothing. You were wrong – it is because you are nothing that I can destroy you. You have no heart, you have no spirit, you have no reason to exist – even your hate is a pale reflection of what once burned in you. You survive out of habit, monster, and habits ... and minds ... can be broken."
  </p>
  <p key="b43fbe9a-abbd-4787-9915-b11b1f155a97">
   The scream that came from Makuta then was a long, loud, and strangely hollow. An instant later, the giant collapsed to the ground and lay unmoving. Takanuva edged closer, and confirmed what he already knew: Makuta was dead. Just to be sure, he used his power to send searing light to every corner of the tunnel, but there was no sign of the master of shadows'

   . He had not escaped this final confrontation.
  </p>
  <p key="4e695989-ecc0-45a3-ab43-98935ff2b1ac">
   Takanuva pondered for a long time as he walked back up to the surface. Turaga

   had once told him that when a Makuta absorbs a body, he must crush the will of his victim immediately. Otherwise, he risks other minds intruding upon his own. Matoro had heard the same tales. He had known if Makuta absorbed him, he could fight back from within.
  </p>
  <p key="20c4c0a2-3775-40e2-9829-1c5772b96e3d">
   At one time, such an effort would have been impossible – Makuta's will would have been too strong. But Matoro had been right. Makuta truly had nothing to live for. He survived and plotted his vengeance, but it was a hollow pursuit. He had lusted for a control of a universe, only to see that universe destroyed ... and there was no place for him in the Kingdom.
  </p>
  <p key="f9092e15-1f67-4eed-9cc9-71d449ce05ab">
   Takanuva would tell the ruling council what had happened down below, and warn them to beware of any other Rahkshi who might still lurk below, clad in shadow armor. He would stay long enough to see a statue erected of Matoro, the Toa who had been granted that rarest of commodities: a second chance to make things right.
  </p>
  <p key="83c70abf-44fd-4820-be2f-557ee24bce70">
   Turaga Takanuva would ask his Toa counterpart to stay, even knowing what the answer would be. In the end, the Brutaka of this universe would use his

   to send Takanuva back into the space between dimensions, on his journey to Karda Nui. There was much to be done, and still a very long way to go.
