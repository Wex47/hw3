   . Within each of the six worlds are four levels, which follow four different types: a level in which the player faces a Rahkshi at the end, a level in which the player must reach a goal point, a level with a "titan" as the boss at the end, and a boss battle with the Piraka of that world. Defeating the Piraka allows the player to play as that Piraka for that world, and beating the game allows the player to play as Vezon in place of the Piraka.

   Scattered throughout the levels are the masks worn by the Toa Inika; collecting that mask allows the player to play as that Toa Inika. Players are allowed to switch between the Toa at will, though if the player loses all their health as one Toa they lose the ability to play as them and must collect that mask again before they can play as them again. Collecting a mask also restores health, even if it is one the character already has.

  <p key="d24f2a01-cc50-40f4-9fe5-926acee61d23">
   During gameplay, players collect LEGO pieces with different point values. Collecting these pieces fills a meter at the top of the screen, and filling it entirely activates "Hero Mode", turning the character golden and giving invincibility as well as an offensive boost; this mode is active indefinitely and is generally used to build and move various constractions to progress, at which point Hero Mode ends. Hero Mode also activates its own unique soundtrack, which fades after Hero Mode ends. After completing a level, the pieces can also be used to purchase items, upgrades, and extras from the in-game Matoran Enclave.

  <p key="6c9edb5a-6c3e-4835-89c5-f939790ed15f">
   Throughout each level are several LEGO "constractions" (a combination of the words "construction" and "action") that can be assembled. Three kinds that must be activated to proceed are normal constructions activated by Toa Hewkii, golden constractions that can be activated by anyone in Hero Mode, (Though doing so causes Hero Mode to end and more points must be collected before it can be entered again) and black constractions that can only be activated by Vezon.
  </p>
  <p key="a939cd28-a36d-4590-aa5f-094d674218cc">
   Also scattered throughout the levels are several canisters that give bonuses when collected: collecting all of the silver canisters in a level unlocks a common enemy for viewing between levels, while each gold canister found unlocks a collectible item for viewing such as a mask, a disk, a Kraata, etc., or even the Makuta stone. Each regular level includes five silver or four canisters which unlock new characters to read about and four gold canisters which unlock new masks to read about. Boss levels include four gold canisters only. Boss enemies are also unlocked for viewing after they have been defeated (except for Vezon and Fenrakk).

   It should be noted that the game is non-canon, as in the official storyline only the Toa, Piraka, Vezon, Fenrakk, Axonn, and Brutaka are present on the island (except for possibly a few Visorak, but certainly not the vast amount seen in the game), Axonn is a hero character, Roodaka, the Vahki, and Bohrok are nowhere near Voya Nui. In addition, Sidorak, the six Rahkshi (which were rebuilt into Ussanui), and Krekka and Nidhiki are in fact dead by the time the events on Voya Nui take place. In the introduction, it is stated that the Piraka have gotten the Mask of Life and used it to create the enemies seen in the game, though this never happens in the canon storyline. Also, Fenrakk was never destroyed, like he was in the game's final level, and Vezon didn't die after sinking in lava.

   </i>
   was perhaps too similar, and having two such games released within a couple months of each other was tiresome (

   had been released the previous September). Another common point in several reviews was that the game lacked a real story.
  </p>
  <p key="f336578d-9100-4445-9f8a-3293b90efa22">
   Nintendo Power gave the game a 5 out of 10, noting that the game "doesn't feel very LEGO-ish; block-building aspects seldom come into play, and the scenery is only rarely reminiscent of LEGO pieces." (However, this is entirely consistent with the BIONICLE universe as depicted in other media.) GameSpot gave the game a 5.2 out of 10; while they praised the game's visuals and cutscene humor, they criticized the gameplay as being repetitive due to Hero Mode: "By being even remotely selective with how you pick up Lego pieces, you'll be invincible a good two-thirds to three-fourths of the game, which means that nearly every situation before a boss battle is utterly trivialized."

  <p key="c75cb83d-0df7-40a3-96c7-958296589eec">
   The DS version received a fair amount of praise, however.

   ." Where as
   gave it a score of 7.7 out of 10, calling it "another solid first-person shooter for the DS." Criticism was aimed at the fact that it didn't try to break the normal FPS mold and the lack of online multiplayer, as well as requiring every player to have a cartridge for multiplayer.
  </p>
  <p key="dd9e846b-9333-401a-a1b5-c6e2b711d938">
   The Game Boy Advance version also received positive reviews. IGN gave the game a 8.0, praising the game's soundtrack and graphics. They also praised the gameplay, though noted that it is also repetitive. GameSpot gave the game a 7.7, also noting the repetitive gameplay but saying that "it's hard to be bothered by that when enemy robots are always appearing from multiple directions and the screen is constantly filling with bullets and Lego toy pieces." They also praised the game's graphical and musical quality as well.

    There are several rumors about random events in the game, such as facing a horde of flowers instead of normal enemies in the Mountain Path level. This can be achieved in the level Blizzard peaks by going through the first part of the level avoiding killing any enemies and reaching the first area where you need to gain hero mode. Killing all the enemies in that area should then make no more enemies spawn, instead flowers will continuously grow in thst area. This same can also be done in the boss fight by not shooting Nhidiki (as it will summon more enemies).
