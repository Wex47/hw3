   Ekimu was a legendary crafter of

   , alongside his brother Makuta, who along with him defended Ekimu alongside the
   Protectors
   of old. However, Makuta grew jealous, since the islanders of Okoto valued Ekimu's masks more than his, and broke a sacred law by creating masks that contained two Elemental forces instead of one. Ekimu would reprimand his brother for this action, which he learned of during a
   Festival of Masks
   , after which he witnessed a vision of the
   Elemental Creatures
   . This led Ekimu to travel to the
   Temple of Time
   , where he donned the
   Mask of Time
   and saw a vision of events to come. Realizing the danger Okoto was in, Ekimu used sacred
   Elemental Crystals
   provided by the Creatures to forge

   in preparation for the arrival of the Toa.

   When Makuta created and donned the heretical

   , Ekimu saw this, and knocked it from his brother's face. The resulting shock wave put both brothers into a deep slumber. With his last breath, he whispered the Prophecy of Heroes to the Protectors. The Protectors forged him a special golden mask and laid him to rest in a gold coffin decorated with an emblem of the Mask of Creation. The Mask itself eventually came to rest on the bridge leading into the
   City of the Mask Makers
   , which was eventually abandoned by the people of Okoto and became a den of evil.

  <p key="c1b57be4-9c52-476a-a71d-a37b5dc61cd7">
   After the Toa arrived on Okoto, Ekimu guided them to collecting their Golden Masks and bringing them together at the Ancient City. There, Ekimu once again guided the Toa to his resting place, where they combined their elemental powers in order to awaken him. After being freed, he explained to the Toa that his Mask of Creation had been taken by Makuta's minion

   to his forge to be destroyed. When they arrived at the forge, the Skull Grinder put on the Mask of Creation. Ekimu told the Toa to distract him, as he searched for pieces to create a new Hammer of Power. When he finished, Ekimu used his weapon to fire Elemental Gatling blasts, and to knock the Mask of Creation from the Skull Grinder's face. He took back the mask and repaired the Golden Masks of Power, which were damaged in the conflict. He told the Toa that he had never seen such bravery, and that they were worthy heroes.

   started returning to the city, Ekimu would leave on a mission with the Toa to rescue a pair of young villagers, and found them in the clutches of Ekimu's old enemies, the
   Skull Raiders
   . A battle between the heroes and their foes soon ensued, which was joined by the escaped Kulta, whom Ekimu succeeded in defeating for a final time. Some time thereafter, Ekimu forged new masks and armor for the Toa, which they tested against a small group of surviving
   Skull Warriors
   and
   Skull Spiders
   before setting out to find the Elemental Creatures. Upon their return, Ekimu learned that the Creatures had been responsible for hiding Makuta's

  <p key="5e13a2c1-2435-4f92-90c4-ee865fa411d9">
   When the Toa returned to report their failure to retrieve the mask, Ekimu was not surprised, having learned the full contents of the
   Prophecy of Heroes
   written on the walls of the Temple of Light. When the
   Shadow Horde
   attacked the Ancient City, he quickly deduced that it was a distraction to allow the mutated Umarak to find the pieces of Makuta's mask. After summoning
   Agil
   , Ekimu entered a chamber in the shrine and was infused with the power of
