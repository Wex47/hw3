   One hundred thousand years ago Teridax was "created" by the Great Spirit Mata Nui as a member of the Brotherhood of Makuta, whose job was to create and alter

   as needed; the Brotherhood soon also took on the job of protecting Mata Nui's chosen people, the

    Matoran
   </a>
   . Teridax was put specifically in charge of the city of Metru Nui and its surrounding region by the leader of the Brotherhood, Miserix. In this time, Mata Nui and Teridax were so close that they were considered "brothers".
  </p>
  <p key="ab3d74d2-ca1d-4abc-8363-83b1b782db43">
   At one point eighty thousand years ago, the Brotherhood had discovered through the traitor

    League of Six Kingdoms
   </a>
   was plotting no less than the overthrow of Mata Nui himself. The Brotherhood, allied with Mata Nui's champions, the Toa, and Teridax led a preemptive strike against the League and their leaders, six warlords titled "
   <a href="Barraki.html" key="24acc228-baad-4261-a789-e12ac2138cfd" title="Barraki">

   ." The operation was a complete success, and all six Barraki were captured, but as Teridax was about to execute them a stranger named

   appeared. He and Teridax argued over the fate of the Barraki until Botar finally teleported away, taking the Barraki to

   with him. Though Teridax would occasionally wonder about the stranger and what he had done with the Barraki, he would more often consider the League's ultimate goal, and concluded that a Barraki was ultimately unworthy to replace the Great Spirit. However, he then began thinking about taking over the Matoran Universe himself.

  <p key="a5ec4547-4d7c-4f6c-a9b7-fd044faeab23">
   Spurred on by this thought, Teridax (and eventually the rest of the Brotherhood) became jealous of the high regard that Mata Nui was given by the Matoran and began brooding on ways to overthrow Mata Nui, and with the information gleaned from

   . Eventually, Teridax revealed to the other Makuta his plan, which was to put Mata Nui to sleep, intending to take his place in the minds of the Matoran as their savior. Miserix alone went against this, but no other Makuta supported him. After a short brawl, Teridax claimed leadership of the Brotherhood and ordered Miserix executed, though the execution never took place and Miserix was instead imprisoned on

He offered Vakama a truce until they got the Vahi back, and he kept his word - until the Dark Hunter leader,

Enraged, the two Hunters attacked Teridax, breaching his armor; however, Makuta was able to knock Voporak out and make the Shadowed One age prematurely in Voporak's defensive field. Because of this incident, the Shadowed One declared war on the Brotherhood of Makuta. In the confusion, Vakama snatched the Vahi and began flying away.

While she was doing this, Makuta challenged Takanuva in the Matoran sport of kolhii, and the ensuing "game" damaged much of the lair. When the Matoran arrived, Makuta took out the lair's last remaining pillar, causing a cave-in and cutting off the Matoran's escape route. Takanuva then tried to rip Teridax's Mask of Shadows off of his face, causing the two to fall into a pool of energized protodermis and emerge as a single being,

   Despite the apparent victory, Takanuva had some suspicions that Teridax let the Matoran win to further some grander plan. According to series writer Greg Farshtey, "My feeling has always been that Makuta knew that the Toa and Matoran would make it back to Metru Nui eventually – so he intentionally lost the fight to Takanuva, allowing them to go back there thinking they had won. This way, they would be occupied with rebuilding for some time and convinced the danger from Makuta was largely over, and thus ignore what he was truly up to."

Makuta left, knowing Hydraxon was likely to destroy the Ignika, but not before promising Brutaka that their battle wasn't over.

   , Hydraxon, and Mantax. Wanting to get rid of Makuta/Maxilos, Matoro suggested to the Toa Mahri that Maxilos track Hydraxon down. Without a choice, Makuta headed off in search for the jailer. When he finally tracked down Hydraxon, the jailer - thinking that Maxilos was still an obedient robotic guardian - asked the robot to go with him in search of Mantax. When Teridax tried and failed to persuade Hydraxon to stop following Mantax and capture the Toa Mahri and the other Barraki, Makuta/Maxilos attacked the jailer. Hydraxon summoned Spinax to attack Maxilos, only for the Rahi to be swiped away by the powerful being. Hydraxon then attacked Teridax using daggers, which stuck directly in the leg armor of the Maxilos robot. Ripping the daggers out, Teridax roared at Hydraxon, and the sound blast knocked Hydraxon off his feet. Hydraxon managed to aim his Cordak Blaster at an undersea mountain, causing boulders to rain on Makuta.

   Teridax then turned to confront the Barraki, revealing that he was not Maxilos and was actually the Makuta who had led to the Barraki's defeat. Anguished, the Barraki attacked Teridax, only to have four of their members defeated. Takadox then attempted to get out of the attack by showing Teridax the Betrayal Contract. Makuta then cast Takadox into a vision, displaying the Barraki's destiny. Unknown to Teridax, however, the other Barraki were slowly gathering their armies. By the time Teridax stopped casting the vision, the Barraki had already assembled their armies and revealed to Makuta that they were merely feigning defeat. They then summoned their troops of over 100,000 underwater Rahi against one.

   Maxilos' body was greatly damaged after being attacked by the Barraki's armies. Pulling himself up from the fight, Teridax simply let the Barraki go, only wanting to delay them and not destroy them. He felt the abrupt change when Mata Nui died, and knowing that it could not be the end, he hoped that the Toa Mahri would continue their task to revive the Great Spirit so that his plans can succeed. Teridax later left the shattered remains of Maxilos.

Matoro then allowed himself to be absorbed into the Makuta's body. However, Matoro's will was too powerful for him to overcome; the 10,000 years of waiting coupled with the failure of his plans had rendered him weak willed with nothing truly left to live for, and both Teridax and Matoro died.

The Teridax of the main universe then created a maelstrom which blew the pair down to the village. Through the mouths of the dead Visorak scattered around the village, the Makuta spoke to them, saying that a weaker version of himself could never defeat him. The alternate Teridax stated that he was stronger because he resisted the temptations his counterpart could not. As a response, and to end the threat posed by another Makuta, the Teridax of the Matoran Universe teleported three Shadow Takanuva to the village. This version of Teridax carried a Warhammer and wore a golden Mask of Shadows.

   Makuta Teridax was portrayed as the ultimate personification of pure evil. He was arrogant and proud, desiring praise and devotion and becoming jealous when others got it instead of him.

   Like many of his fellow Makuta, Teridax displayed traits of extreme sadism, terrible temper, and cruelty, taking considerable pleasure in the suffering and the deaths of others. One of his more prominent demonstrations of this trait was when he taunted Toa Takanuva over the death of his friend Jaller, calling him a failure and blaming him for his friend’s death before proceeding to challenge him to a game of Kohli, calling it “his next great failure” and being willing to kill many of the Matoran in front of him, chuckling in amusement at the thought. Another Makuta trait Teridax possessed was a dry, sardonic sense of humour. A narcissist, Teridax envied the admiration that the Great Spirit received from the other races of the universe and identified himself as the living embodiment of destruction. He boasted that he had no true allies because he had no equals and demonstrated an unshakable belief that it was his right to take control of creation and remake it in his own image; his ego was such that he chose to refer to himself as

   put it, "just armor and energy - no organics, not anymore." Makuta needed his armor in order to hold his Antidermis energy together; if the armor was damaged, then the Antidermis would leak out and weaken him. Since his armor was completely destroyed, Teridax then existed merely as a mass of energy; but should too much time pass this energy would dissipate and he would die.
  </p>
  <p key="17520094-1768-4c3c-80cd-fc65887ea21a">
   One of Teridax's most commonly-used powers was his ability to shapeshift, allowing him to shape his armor to any form he desired. The only limitation on this power was that when changing into a bigger, stronger form, he couldn't do it quickly unless he absorbed power and mass from somewhere. If what he absorbed was a living being, then their body was incorporated into his and their mind and spirit utterly destroyed (though not always immediately - Teridax blamed his defeat in Metru Nui on having to suppress the minds of Nidhiki, Krekka, and Nivawk at the same time: "I disagreed with something I ate"). In his energy form, Makuta still had some limited shapeshifting power, capable of making his energy liquid, gaseous or even viral.

   He controlled the element of shadows, allowing him to manipulate shadow energy into different shapes such as spheres, beams, or hands. This power was strengthened by his Kanohi Kraahkan, the Mask of Shadows, which could fill others with fear and anger. However, due to the fact that his powers were based on shadow; light-based attacks against him proved to be especially effective.
