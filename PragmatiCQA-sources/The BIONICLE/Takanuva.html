   Wandering through the desert, Takua revisited Po-Koro, where he found that most of the villagers had fallen ill to a
   plague
   that was rampant. Eventually, Takua deduced that the virus had come from the new
   Koli
   balls that were being sold. He brought one of the infected balls to Turaga

While he wasn't looking, though, the Ta-Matoran noticed a strange peg-like object with an elemental symbol on its head lying next to Ahkmou's kiosk. Travelling into Po-Koro's quarry, Takua discovered that the item was actually a key to a secret passage. At the end of this passage, Takua found Ahkmou's "secret source": a Nui-Jaga nest filled with infected Koli balls. The giant scorpion was about to attack Takua when a brown-armored figure descended the steps into the nest - Pohatu, Toa of Stone... who promptly took a blow from the Jaga's stinger. Temporarily blinded, Pohatu needed Takua to act as his eyes so that he could destroy the pillars supporting the nest by knocking them down with Koli balls. Ultimately, Pohatu and Takua succeeded in kicking down the pillars, and the Toa used his

   Returning to Po-Koro, Takua found that Pohatu had already come and gone, and taken all infected Comets and thrown them into the sea; with their disposal, the plague had subsided and vanished. Impressed by Ta-Matoran's bravery, Onewa gave Takua a golden chisel to show to Nokama as a sign of Onewa's faith. Takua thus became the new Chronicler, and was given the Book of Chronicles by the Turaga of Water, so that he could record the events he witnessed.

Using his

   After the struggle in the Drifts, Matoro and Takua returned to the Sanctum, and Nuju told the Chronicler through Matoro that the Toa were preparing to travel into Makuta's lair, and that Takua must assemble a group of Matoran to aid them. Travelling around the island, Takua enlisted the help of various Matoran he had encountered on his travels: Kapura, Tamaru, Taipu, Hafu, Maku and Kopeke. Together, the
   seven Matoran
   travelled to Kini-Nui, where the Toa were preparing to enter Makuta's lair. Shortly before descending, Gali told Takua that she would send him visions of what happened to the Toa below.

   Onepu
   , the Commander of Onu-Koro's Ussalry, the Chronicler travelled on an Ussal named
   Puku
   to Onu-Koro, where Whenua told him that the gold mask that appeared below the Great Sundial had suddenly disappeared, and that Onu-Matoran had abandoned the site, believing it to be an entrance to Makuta's lair. Travelling back down into the chamber under the Sundial, Takua discovered firsthand that was exactly what it was, and descended into darkness.

   Venturing through the Mangaia's shadowy depths, Takua eventually found the Toa about to face Makuta. Hiding behind a doorway, the Chronicler witnessed them struggle against the Master of Shadows, be pushed to the brink of defeat before joining together to defeat Makuta. After the battle, the Toa were teleported up, and Takua found himself seemingly alone in Mangaia. 
At this point, however, a new passageway opened up seemingly by itself, and Takua entered it to find a dim, green-lit room with walls comprised of several large, round hemispheres.

Coming across a gold sphere with a slot in it, Takua realized that the hole's shape matched the golden chisel Onewa had given him, and managed to pull it from his pack and insert it into the slot before the pursuing creatures could reach him. Immediately, a bubble formed around him, and spirited him out of the lair, away from the swarms and onto the beach of Ta-Wahi, where he had begun his journey.

Little did they know, though, that this would not be the last they saw of Makuta Teridax.

   Takanuva was then approached by a
   mysterious being taking the form of a Hau
   , who began to inform him that a nearby village faced great danger. Hearing this, Takua rushed off to save the village before the Mask could clarify the nature of the danger.
  </p>
  <p key="94584f56-e597-4ead-a293-5c1d29b99d1a">
   The "village" turned out to be a vast city of silver towers, and upon entering it Takanuva found a
   large beast
   locked in combat with a race of purple-black beings known as
   Kestora
   . Assuming the creature to be the threat the mask-like entity spoke of, Takanuva successfully drove the creature out of the City of Silver. However, he soon discovered that the creature he had believed to be the threat was actually benevolent and peaceful, and one of the true builders and residents of the City before the Kestora attacked it. Moreover, the Kestora were responsible for wiping out the rest of the creature's kind, leaving it the sole surviving member of his species. Determined to correct his mistake, Takanuva sought out the city-building creature, gained his trust, and joined forces to retake the city; using his powers of light, Takanuva drew the Kestora out of the city by creating a fireworks display, while the creature burrowed back into his city home and locked the Kestora out.

   After the whole ordeal, the Spectral Mask congratulated him for learning to not assume good or evil based on appearances, and opened a new dimensional gateway for the Toa. However, instead of ending up in Karda Nui, Takanuva now found himself in what appeared to be a cross between the island of Mata Nui and Metru Nui.

   Takanuva was surprised to find that he was once again on the island of Mata Nui, but it was different from how he remembered it: The island had become a massive megalopolis, a fusion of old and new architecture, and Matoran now worked and lived in harmony alongside creatures that were hostile in his dimension, such as Visorak, Skakdi, Bohrok and even Dark Hunters. Approached by this dimension's version of Macku, Takanuva tried to explain who he was, but the Ga-Matoran wasn't convinced, as he was much taller than the "real" Takanuva, who was now a Turaga in this timeline. A very confused Takanuva asked to be led to Jaller, and a suspicious Macku led him into the city despite her better judgment, but not before consulting

   Takanuva was then brought to Toa Jaller, who informed him that the island was now known as the Kingdom of the Great Spirit. The Toa of Light briefly considered proving his identity to Jaller by telling him things only he would know, but discarded it as such revelations would be more likely to raise suspicions rather than quell them; instead, he simply said that he was a friend of this world's Turaga Takanuva, and that he had been told to go to Jaller if he was in trouble. The Fire Toa offhandedly commented that he and the other five Toa Mahri were not well-liked in the Kingdom; his mention of Matoro being alive got Takanuva's attention, and he rushed to this world's Wall of History, where he found out what had caused this world's present to differ from that of his own: Where his universe's Matoro had succeeded in reviving Mata Nui at the cost of his own life, the Matoro of this universe had briefly hesitated, and thus was sealed off from the core of the universe and unable to use the

   However, the Turaga of Metru Nui had been planning for this possible outcome, and led the mass migration of as many of the MU species as possible out of the dying universe and onto the surface of Mata Nui. Agreeing that they needed to cooperate to survive, the various species decided to live in harmony, and thus the Kingdom was born. The Brotherhood of Makuta also attempted to reach the surface, but the Toa Takanuva of this dimension and the Order of Mata Nui sealed them underground with barriers of pure light. His destiny fulfilled, the Toa of Light gave his

   Paying a visit, Takanuva found his alternate self in deep discussion with Tanma and Roodaka, concerned about the recent appearance of a

He then concluded the meeting, and spoke to Takanuva in private. He immediately recognized his prime universe self, and asked for his help in protecting the island from the Makuta.

Travelling into the long-abandoned Bohrok tunnels in Po-Wahi, Takanuva, Tanma and Matoro encountered and defeated four Rahkshi clad in shadow armor that allowed them to get through the light barriers unscathed. Afterward, however, Makuta himself stepped through the barrier; all of the other Makuta had died, one by one, and Makuta had feasted upon them to survive; he had now become a monstrous amalgamation of his own followers' bodies. Tanma attacked, destroying his Kraahkan, but Makuta promptly killed him by shattering his body. It was at this point he recognized Takanuva as being from a universe where Makuta's

Upon discovering the sacrifice his alternate self had made, Matoro resolved to do the same, and allowed himself to be drawn into Makuta's body. His willpower proved far greater than that of this world's Makuta, and he killed him from the inside, sacrificing himself in the process.

   After passing through the dimensional gate, Takanuva found himself back in Metru Nui, seemingly where he had started his journey.

   Mask of Intangibility
   . Noticing Kapura walking nearby, the Toa of Light approached the Ta-Matoran. However, Takanuva was confused to see that his friend not only did not recognize him, but was also terrified by his presence. The Toa tried to ask of the whereabouts of the Turaga and

   Dragging him into the prisons below the Coliseum, the Toa Mata of Fire and Ice incarcerated Takanuva in one of the cells. There, he was shocked to find that his cellmate was none other than his parallel self; still a Matoran in this dystopian universe, Takua had never become a Toa, and when the Vahki failed to discourage his tendency of wandering, he was incarcerated. After he was freed by his parallel Toa counterpart, Takua explained that 3,500 years prior, a Toa named

   In the Karda Nui swamps, Takanuva emerged from a pocket dimension. After three attempts to get to Karda Nui, he had finally arrived. There he found Toa Mistika Gali Nuva, in battle with Makuta Krika. He attacked Krika, who saw him and quickly disappeared. Takanuva helped Gali to her feet and they began looking for the other Toa Nuva.

  <p key="ddae0f23-46b2-4033-b8b7-55b1921cbc5b">
   Eventually, Takanuva spotted an orange Toa-shaped being in the distance and prepared to battle it... looking more closely at the figure, however, he realized it was none other than Toa Pohatu. It was around this point that he realized that he had once been an Av-Matoran himself, and that the Makuta were enslaving his compatriots by draining their inner Light. He swore that he would save the Matoran, even if he must die.
  </p>
  <p key="77ea9ce7-cfc1-41de-b773-297f6788be24">
   Later on, the trio of Toa encountered some violent insectoid Rahi called
   Niazesk
   . Noticing the Toa, they attacked. Gali and Pohatu soon started fighting. Takanuva lowered his lance to blast the Niazesk with light, but changed his mind in favor of his Shadow powers to take down all of the flying Rahi. Raising his right hand, he called upon the power of shadow, blasting the oncoming Niazesk directly. The Toa of Twilight turned towards his teammates, expecting them to congratulate him on winning the fight. Instead he saw fear in their eyes, and Pohatu pointing his weapon at him.

   The stone Toa remarked that he had always wondered where Makuta Teridax had gone, and now he knew. When Takanuva protested, Pohatu said that he had ten seconds to prove that he really was the Toa of Light. Remembering that he had formed a bond with Gali on Mata Nui, Takanuva quickly suggests she read his mind. She did, citing his trips during the process. His identity confirmed, Takanuva had the two Toa Nuva brief him on the current situation in the Swamp. Afterwards he tipped the balance of the battle and drove the Makuta back. He met the Toa Ignika and learned about the countdown to the end of the universe, and revealed to the Toa Nuva that the

   entered the Codrex. Takanuva witnessed the discovery of the vehicles and the theft of
   Jetrax T6
   . Angered at the actions of Antroz, Takanuva realized that it was his destiny to destroy all the Makuta, and left the Codrex to do so. He followed Kopaka, who was pursuing the Jetrax T6, out of the Codrex, but Kopaka was stopped by Radiak. Takanuva offered to deal with the Shadow Matoran, and was jeered as a "Toa of Twilight". Wanting to unleash his light powers, Takanuva realized that he had to find a cure for the Shadow Matoran. Later, he was joined by the three Av-Matoran, Photok, Solek, and Tanma, and helped him drag Radiak through the sky. Takanuva was thinking of a way to help the Matoran when Photok alerted him to the arrival of Vican, who claimed to know a way to save the victims of the Shadow Leeches, having been cured himself. Takanuva went with the Le-Matoran, and the two located a winged Rahi known as a
   Klakk
   . Radiak then fired a bolt of Shadow at the Rahi, and the Klakk turned around and hit Radiak with a high-pitched sonic scream.

Having defeated the sons of Makuta, Takanuva retrieved the Armor piece from their bodies. After the other pieces were retrieved, Takanuva gave his to Tahu, who donned them and triggered a wave of intense energy that struck each of the Rahkshi and incinerating their Kraata within. This distracted Makuta long enough for Mata Nui to defeat his former brother, ending the Master of Shadows once and for all. After the battle, Takanuva was also present when Mata Nui went dormant on the newly-formed

    Strangely, "nuva" is part of Takanuva's name, rather than the name of his form. A possible real world explanation is that it was a part of LEGO's marketing campaign to keep the identity of the Toa of Light secret before the premiere of the movie (rather than revealing it early on, which would have happened had the set been called "Takua Nuva").
