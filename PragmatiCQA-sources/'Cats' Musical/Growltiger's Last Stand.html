   The sequence starts with Gus transforming into Growltiger centre-stage. This is done by removing his large blanket coat to reveal the pirate costume underneath and adding an eye patch. His shoulders and belly also expand comically thus turning the frail Gus into the bulky, muscular Growltiger. This effect is achieved by having a stage technician release Freon gas by remote control into a hidden tank in the stomach of the Growltiger costume, which is in turn linked to inflatable rubber shoulder pads. Meanwhile, Growltiger's barge and his Raffish Crew appear on-stage.
  </p>
  <p key="9a64eacb-bdc6-48d2-90e2-8c0760c612d3">
   His transformation complete, the members of the Raffish Crew begin to sing about Growltiger while he struts around and postures for the audience.
  </p>
  <p key="ffdab7bb-5f64-460a-ae3e-b9caac82996d">
   The musical mood changes to a lush Puccini-esque romantic melody as Griddlebone arrives, and is brought onstage by the crew. Griddlebone flirts with everybody, but Growltiger demands her attention, scares off his crew, and they sing their Lover's Duet. Growltiger and Griddlebone compete for the limelight to comedic effect, far more interested in showing off than in each other. Unbeknownst to Growltiger and his crew, a rival gang of Siamese are slowly sneaking up on them.
  </p>
  <p key="07c164f3-f6c2-48eb-8269-2c6af60971c5">
   The staging differs between "Billy M'Caw" and the Aria. In "Billy M'Caw", the crew and even the Siamese, creeping onstage, join in the rousing chorus of the drinking song. The Aria on the other hand, focuses entirely on the duet and their operatic antics.
  </p>
  <p key="3b95e99e-2051-490c-b933-70ee5cfc8099">
   As the audience applause dies down, the Siamese board Growltiger's barge and launch their attack. Griddlebone escapes in the chaos, but Growltiger finds himself in a duel for his life against Genghis while surrounded by his enemies. Growltiger is soon disarmed and forced to walk the plank to his death. The Siamese sing of their victory, and as the last notes echo, Gus re-appears in the present.
  </p>
  <p key="89a3b0b7-cb98-47a0-ac72-27613e94f68b">
   He takes a final bow to Genghis, and sings a short reprise of "These modern productions are all very well/ But there's nothing to equal from what, I hear tell,/ That moment of mystery as I made history...."

   The opening section was completely re-written as a smoky jazz number mostly sung by Growltiger in the first person. It has many lyric alterations and re-writes. Growltiger no longer has a pirate cutlass, but rather a
   as a weapon. The Raffish Crew are busy raising a sail from the side of the set, which covers the upper stage, and they wheel on a barrel-shaped couch.
  </p>
  <p key="bcc85274-59f9-41e3-b2fc-6b4a185f62a0">
   The slow jazz sound is dramatically contrasted by the arrival of Griddlebone, with the unchanged Puccini-esque romantic melody. There are some minor lyric changes in Griddlebone's introduction, "The tender moon was shining bright" is replaced by "A lover's moon...", and Griddlebone sings her own introduction in first person in the same manner as Growltiger did.
  </p>
  <p key="7dc0f63c-e530-4d02-9180-5fe53797ff45">
   The Lovers' Duet was cut altogether in the first Palladium run, as Growltiger and Griddlebone seemed about to settle down together, the Siamese attacked. However for the second Palladium run, a new version of the Aria was introduced. Whereas the original version of "In Una Tepida Notte" is clearly a Puccini pastiche, and staged as a very over-the-top operatic performance of two big egos trying to out-shine each other, the new version sounds like a Venetian ballad, and is played straight without any comedy.
  </p>
  <p key="ad8e943f-2120-484f-bff7-6153a51be128">
   The Siamese attack was also re-written: rather than having an eastern pentatonic influence the new composition is a strident atonal and arrhythmic piece. Growltiger no longer duels for his life.

   also retained it, but redesigned the Siamese costumes: removing the armour and reducing the effect of caricature, and changing the colour palette to shades of blue and grey more in keeping with the visual tone of the revised number. These changes were retained for the 2020
   Asia tour

   "Growltiger's Last Stand" is primarily composed in the key of C major and set in the 4/4 time signature - occasionally flitting to 2/4. The opening section sees Growltiger and his Raffish Crew singing; their refrains set to a tempo of 116 beats per minute (bpm). As Griddlebone's Introduction begins, the key changes to Db major and the tempo slows down to 88 bpm, the brash opening giving way to a lush romantic melody. The key signature is transposed four times in just this section alone, first from Db major to A major, then to E major, then to D major, and lastly back to the song's home key of C major.
  </p>
  <p key="177c2ec8-04a6-4bc8-aa8d-09be2dd95641">
   Growltiger and Griddlebone then begin their Lover Duet's and the music slows down even more. The original version of the duet is "The Ballad of Billy M'Caw", which is composed in the style of a boisterous British drinking song. It is written in the E major key and set to a 6/8 meter, with a tempo of 56 bpm.
  </p>
  <p key="52bb8dc6-0fbf-4f51-801f-e2851967cd4d">
   Alternatively, the Italian aria "In una tepida notte" may be performed. This parody of Puccini-style operatic love duets remains in the common time and is composed in the Eb major key, shifting to E major in the last verse.
  </p>
  <p key="e4d00e49-d9af-4bf5-bd2f-69f657dd6b1a">
   As the duet comes to an end, the Siamese launch their attack and the music speeds up to 140 bpm without warning ("presto"). This section is fast-paced and sees a return to the original 4/4 time signature and C major key, though it switches to C minor midway through.
   It ends grandly and triumphantly as the Siamese celebrate their victory. Gus finally reemerges and sings a short reprise of his quiet song, a sharp contrast to the dramatics of the preceding sections.

   In "The Ballad of Billy M'Caw", both Growltiger and Griddlebone's vocals span from B3 to G#5.
   In the aria "In Una Tepida Notte", Growltiger's vocals span from B3 to Bb5, while Griddlebone's span from B3 to B5.

    Growltiger was a bravo cat who travelled on a barge
    In fact he was the roughest cat that ever roamed at large
    From Gravesend up to Oxford he pursued his evil aims
    Rejoicing in his title of "The Terror of the Thames"
    His manners and appearance did not calculate to please
    His coat was torn and seedy, he was baggy at the knees
    One ear was somewhat missing, no need to tell you why
    And he scowled upon a hostile world from one forbidding eye
    The cottagers of Rotherhithe knew something of his fame
    At Hammersmith and Putney, people shuddered at his name
    They would fortify the hen house, lock up the silly goose
    When the rumor ran along the shore: Growltiger's on the loose!
    Woe to the weak canary, that fluttered from its cage
    Woe to the pampered Pekinese, that faced Growltiger's rage
    Woe the bristly Bandicoot, that lurks on foreign ships
    And woe to any cat with whom Growltiger came to grips
    But most to cats of foreign race his hatred had been vowed
    To cats of foreign name and race, no quarter was allowed
    The Persian and the Siamese regarded him with fear
    Because it was a Siamese that mauled his missing ear

    In the forepeak of the vessel, Growltiger stood alone
    Concentrating my attention on the lady Griddlebone
    And my raffish crew were sleeping in their barrels and their bunks
    As the Siamese came creeping in their sampans and their junks
    Growltiger had no eye or ear for aught but Griddlebone
    And the lady seemed enraptured by my manly baritone
    Disposed to relaxation and awaiting no surprise
    But the moonlight shone reflected from a thousand bright blue eyes
    And closer still and closer the sampans circled 'round
    And yet from all the enemy there was not heard a sound
    The foe was armed with toasting forks and cruel carving knives
    And the lovers sang their last duet in danger of their lives

    Oh, how well I remember "The Old Bull and Bush",
    Where we used to go down of a Saturday night,
    Where, when anythink happened, it come with a rush,
    For the boss, Mr Clark, He was very polite;
    A very nice House, from basement to garret
    A very nice House. Ah, but it was the parrot
    The parrot, the parrot named Billy M'Caw
    That brought all those folk to the bar.
    Ah! he was the life of the bar!
    Of a Saturday night, we was all feeling bright.
    And Lily La Rose, the barmaid that was,
    She'd sing "Billy, Billy M'Caw!
    Come give us, come give us a dance at the bar!"
    And Billy would dance on the bar
    And Billy would dance on the bar
    And then we'd feel balmy, in each eye a tear,
    And emotion would make us all order more beer.
    Lily, she was a girl what had brains in her head;
    She wouldn't have nothink, no, not that much said.
    If it come to an argument, or a dispute,
    She’d settle it off-hand with the toe of her boot
    Or as likely as not put her fist through your eye.
    But when we was happy, and just a bit dry,
    Or when we was thirsty, and just a bit sad,
    She would rap on the bar with that corkscrew she had -

    In una tepida notte d'estate, allorche la natura
    Era nel pieno fulgore, e la fresca rugiada
    Splendiva al chiar di luna sopra la verzura,
    Si poteva vedere il galeone ancorato
    Oscillare in silenzio nel vento profumato,
    Dalla marea del naviglio serenemente cullato
    In quella tepida notte che c'e dunque di male
    Se in tanto poesia il pirata divento sentimentale?

    Then Genghis gave the signal to his fierce Mongolian horde
    With a frightful burst of fireworks, the Siamese swarmed aboard
    Abandoning their sampans, their pullaways, and junks
    They battened down the hatches on the crew within their bunks
    Then Griddlebone she gave a screech for she was badly skeered
    I am sorry to admit it, but she quickly disappeared
    She probably escaped with ease I'm sure she was not drowned
    But a serried ring of flashing steel Growltiger did surround
    The ruthless foe pressed forward in stubborn rank on rank
    Growltiger to his vast surprise was forced to walk the plank
    He who a hundred victims had driven to that drop
    At the end of all his crimes was forced to go kerflip, kerflop
    Oh there was joy in Wapping when the news flew through the land
    At Maidenhead and Henley there was dancing on the Strand
    Rats were roasted whole in Brentford and Victoria Dock
    And a day of celebration was commanded in Bangkok!

   "Growltiger's Last Stand" has been met with criticism from both critics and theatre fans, condemning the portrayal of the Siamese for its dated and offensive racial stereotypes. The number has been phased out of all US and UK productions since 2016.
