   The Cats perform a play narrated and directed by Munkustrap, who has clearly been rehearsing with the other characters and expects them to remember their cues. The "
   Matinee Lines
   " include Munkustrap saying "Hurry! Make Ready! Remember what I told you to do!" as he checks that various characters are in the right place and that they have their "Dog" costumes ready.

   The performance does not go smoothly; the leader of the Pollicles steals a line from the leader of the Pekes, Tugger interrupts with bagpipes, the Rumpus Cat does not appear on cue, and so on. By the end of the performance, Old Deuteronomy reflects on Munkustrap's play, saying:

   The Invitation to the Jellicle Ball

   Jellicle theme

    Of the Awefull Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles
    Together with some account
    Of the participation of the Pugs and the Poms
    And the intervention of the Great Rumpus Cat
    The Pekes and the Pollicles, everyone knows,
    Are proud and implacable passionate foes;
    It is always the same, wherever one goes.
    And the Pugs and the Poms, although most people say
    That they do not like fighting, yet once in a way,
    They will now and again join in to the fray
    And they
    Bark, bark, bark, bark
    Bark, bark, bark, bark
    Until you can hear them all over the Park.
    And they
    Bark, bark, bark, bark
    Bark, bark, bark, bark
    Until you can hear them all over the Park.
    Now on the occasion of which I shall speak
    Almost nothing had happened for nearly a week
    (And that's a long time for a Pol or a Peke).
    The big Police Dog was away from his beat -
    I don't know the reason, but most people think
    He'd slipped into the Wellington Arms for a drink -
    And no one at all was about on the street
    When a Peke and a Pollicle happened to meet.
    They did not advance, or exactly retreat,
    But they glared at each other, and scraped their hind feet,
    And started to
    Bark, bark, bark, bark
    Bark, bark, bark, bark
    Until you could hear them all over the Park.
    And they
    Bark, bark, bark, bark
    Bark, bark, bark, bark
    Until you could hear them all over the Park.
    Now the Peke, although people may say what they please,
    Is no British Dog, but a Heathen Chinese.
    And so all the Pekes, when they heard the uproar,
    Some came to the window, some came to the door;
    There were surely a dozen, more likely a score.
    And together they started to grumble and wheeze
    In their huffery-snuffery Heathen Chinese.
    But a terrible din is what Pollicles like,
    For your Pollicle Dog is a dour Yorkshire tyke.

     There are dogs out of every nation,
     The Irish, the Welsh and the Dane;
     The Russian, the Dutch, the Dalmatian,
     And even from China and Spain;
     The Poodle, the Pom, the Alsatian
     And the Mastiff who walks on a chain.
     And to those that are frisky and frollical
     Let my meaning be perfectly plain:
     That my name it is Little Tom Pollicle -
     And you'd better not do it again.

    And his braw Scottish cousins are snappers and biters,
    And every dog-jack of them notable fighters;
    And so they stepped out, with their pipers in order,
    Playing "When the Blue Bonnets Come Over the Border".
    Then the Pugs and the Poms held no longer aloof,
    But some from the balcony, some from the roof,
    Joined in to the din with a
    Bark, bark, bark, bark
    Bark, bark, bark, bark
    Until you could hear them all over the Park.
    Huffery-snuffery, huffery-snuffery
    (bark, bark, bark, bark)
    Huffery-snuffery, huffery-snuff
    (bark, bark, bark, bark)
    Until you could hear them all over the Park.
    (Cacophony of barking)
    NOW!!! - when these bold heroes together assembled,
    The traffic all stopped, and the Underground trembled,
    And some of the neighbours were so much afraid
    That they started to ring up the Fire Brigade.
    When suddenly, up from a small basement flat,
    Why who should stalk out but the GREAT RUMPUS CAT.
    His eyes were like fireballs fearfully blazing,
    He gave a great yawn, and his jaws were amazing;
    And when he looked out through the bars of the area,
    You never saw anything fiercer or hairier.
    And what with the glare of his eyes and his yawning,
    The Pekes and the Pollicles quickly took warning.
    He looked at the sky and he gave a great leap -
    And they every last one of them scattered like sheep.
    And when the Police Dog returned to his beat,
    There wasn't a single one left in the street.
    All hail and all power to the Great Rumpus Cat!
