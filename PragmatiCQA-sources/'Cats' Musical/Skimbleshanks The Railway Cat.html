   calls for a change of pace and wakes up Skimbleshanks, who has been dozing on the car boot. Skimble's number is uptempo and fun. He recounts his life as "The Railway Cat", with all the cats collaborating to act out the crew and passengers on Skimble's train to illustrate his story. The cats collect bits and pieces of junk and assemble them into the shape of a locomotive engine, but just before Skimble can present his masterpiece to Old Deut, it falls apart as the cats lose coordination and concentration. But with a laugh and a shrug, Skimble moves on. The number ends on a joyous mood, only to be interrupted by the arrival of

   The lyrics have remained unchanged over the years, except for Broadway-based productions having the ensemble sing an additional line at the end (

   "Skimbleshanks: The Railway Cat" is an energetic number, matching Skimble's pace as he scurries around making sure the train is running smoothly. It features many verses consisting of fast-paced and wordy rhymes, interjected by a few brief refrains ("Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat / The Cat of the Railway Train") that are rooted in
   Skimble's leitmotif
   .
  </p>
  <p key="824e4eca-2260-4550-844c-e63f2975adf1">
   The opening refrain is set to a tricky 13/8 time signature with a tempo of 98 beats per minute ("lively"). As the patter verses begin, the meter shifts to 4/4 and the tempo speeds up to 144 beats per minute ("vivace"). The meter reverts back to 13/8 every time the refrain is revisited.
  </p>
  <p key="a0275a13-0959-4701-987d-9c991e1bafc1">
   The song is primarily composed in the key of E major, but is transposed to F major in the final third act as Skimble's train is assembled. There is a temporary change in the meter to 2/4 during this transition.
   The reprise at the end is interrupted by a crash and
   Macavity's leitmotif
   .

    Skimbleshanks, the railway cat
    The cat of the railway train!
    There's a whisper down the line at 11:39
    When the Night Mail's ready to depart
    Saying "Skimble! Where is Skimble?
    Has he gone to hunt the thimble?
    We must find him or the train can't start!"
    All the guards and all the porters and the station master's daughters
    Would be searching high and low
    Saying "Skimble! Where is Skimble?
    For unless he's very nimble
    Then the Night Mail just can't go!"
    At 11:42 with the signal overdue,
    And the passengers all frantic to a man
    That's when I would appear, and I'd saunter to the rear
    I'd been busy in the luggage van
    Then he gave one flash of his glass green eyes
    And the signal went all clear!
    They'd be off at last for the northern part
    Of the Northern Hemisphere!
    Skimbleshanks the railway cat!
    The cat of the railway train!
    You could say that by and large
    It was me who was in charge
    Of the sleeping car express
    From the driver and the guards
    To the bagmen playing cards
    I would supervise them all
    More or less
    Down the corridor he paces
    And examines all the faces
    Of the travellers in the first and the third
    He establishes control by a regular patrol
    And he'd know at once if anything occurred
    He would watch you without winking
    And he saw what you were thinking
    And it's certain that he didn't approve
    Of hilarity and riot, so the folk were very quiet
    When Skimble was about and on the move
    You could play no pranks with Skimbleshanks
    He's a cat that cannot be ignored
    So nothing went wrong on the Northern Mail
    When Skimbleshanks was aboard!
    It was very pleasant when they found their little den
    With their name written up on the door (Woo! Woo!)
    And the berth was very neat, with a newly folded sheet
    And not a speck of dust on floor
    There was every sort of light
    You could make it dark or bright
    And a button you could turn to make a breeze (Woo! Woo!)
    And a funny little basin you're supposed to wash your face in
    And a crank to shut the window should you sneeze
    Then the guard looked in politely
    And would ask you very brightly
    "Do you like your morning tea weak or strong?"
    But I was just behind him and was ready to remind him
    For Skimble won't let anything go wrong!
    When they crept into their cosy berths and pulled up the counterpane
    They all could reflect it was very nice
    To know that they wouldn't be bothered by mice
    They could leave all that to the railway cat
    The cat of the railway train!
    Skimbleshanks, the railway cat!
    The cat of the railway train!
    Skimbleshanks, the railway cat!
    The cat of the railway train!
    In the watches of the night I was always fresh and bright
    Every now and then I'd have a cup of tea
    With perhaps a drop of scotch
    While I was keeping on the watch
    Only stopping here and there to catch a flea
    They were fast asleep at Crewe and so they never knew
    That I was walking up and down the station
    They were sleeping all the while
    I was busy at Carlisle
    Where I met the station master with elation
    They might see me at Dumfries if I summon the police
    If there was anything they ought to know about!
    When they got to Gallowgate, there they did not have to wait
    For Skimbleshanks would help them to get out!
    And he gives you a wave of his long brown tail
    Which says "I'll see you again"
    You will meet without fail on the Midnight Mail,
    The cat of the railway train!
