   to music late in 1977, partly because it is a book I remember with affection from my childhood and partly because I wanted to set existing verse to music. When I have written with lyricists in the past we have agreed together the dramatic structure, but for the most part the lyrics have been written to the music. So I was intrigued to see whether I could write a complete piece the other way round.

   contains verses that are extremely musical; they have rhythms that are very much their own, like "
   Rum Tum Tugger
   ' or '
   Old Deuteronomy
   ' and although clearly they dictate to some degree the music that will accompany them they are frequently of irregular and exciting metre and are very challenging to a composing.

   I wrote some settings in late 1977, which I began performing at the piano for friends, but I never progressed the idea seriously until after I had composed

   as a possible concert anthology that could also be performed on television. With this in mind, some of my settings were performed in the summer of 1980 at the Sydmonton Festival. Valerie Eliot fortunately came to the concert and brought with her various unpublished pieces of verse by her husband. One of these was '
   Grizabella the Glamour Cat
   '. The musical and dramatic images that this created for me made me feel that there was very much more to the project than I had realised. I immediately decided that I needed the support of another to encourage me to re-work my settings and to see if a dramatic whole could be woven from the delightful verse that I was now to be allowed to develop.

   . We have been able to include lines from the end of Eliot's draft poem which now introduce '
   The Naming of Cats
   '. But what was most thrilling was to find a reference in one of Eliot's letters to a coherent, albeit incomplete, structure for an evening: he proposed that eventually the cats were to go 'Up up up past the Russell Hotel, up up up to the

   Trevor Nunn, who I discovered has a taste for tackling theatrical problems that most people consider insoluble, set to work immediately with me combing Eliot's work, and we were reminded of the many references to cats in the main body of his writing. We worked on the incomplete structure and were able to incorporate some of these feline references into
