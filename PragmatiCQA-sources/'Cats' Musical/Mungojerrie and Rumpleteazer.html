   After Bustopher Jones' introduction, a loud crashing sound rings throughout the Junkyard, sending the cats into a panic. Macavity is suspected to abound and so members of the tribe run offstage to hide. Suddenly, both Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer spring up, giggling, and begin singing about their lives, profession, and exploits as 'knockabout clowns, quick-change comedians,' etc. They describe their lavish residence and travels causing trouble throughout London, as well as within their own owner's family. They are eventually caught and confronted by the other cats, their bags of stolen goods discarded.
  </p>
  <p key="d53facb2-6962-4c67-a1b7-640f65a43dff">
   Throughout their song, Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer dance and perform acrobatic feats. Their signature piece of choreography is a series of (usually seven) consecutive tandem cartwheels. In the original London production, they were chased around the theatre by the other cats at the end of their song.

    . It is a reworking of the upbeat Broadway tune, but sung and danced by Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer themselves. This version was eventually incorporated into both the Broadway (1987) and London (1996) productions.

   The score for "Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer" has been rewritten over the years. In the original Broadway score, the number opens with
   <a href="Rum Tum Tugger.html" key="fb394e91-eb45-410e-8e0a-aa1c80b5706f" title="Rum Tum Tugger">

   introducing the Magical Mr. Mistoffelees. The song itself alternates between circus/vaudeville-style verses set to 4/4 time, and a wordy patter section set to a frantic asymmetrical 7/8 meter.
   The wildly different passages provide sharp contrast, with a very brief meter change to 2/4 during each transition. This version of the song has a tempo of 96 beats per minute ("easy ragtime") and is primarily composed in the D major key, switching to Eb major for the final verse and patter section (flitting to F major and Db major for four bars each).
  </p>
  <p key="f57e883d-25cc-42fa-8aa4-d48f9c910beb">
   In the modern score, a loud crash followed by
   Macavity's leitmotif
   precedes the number. The verses are similarly set to 4/4 time with a moderate tempo ("moderato"). However, rather than a meter change in the patter section, the song remains in common time but with the tempo sped up to 142 beats per minute. The transitional meter changes to 2/4 remain, with another very brief meter change to 6/4 at the end of the final patter section. This modern version follows the same key changes as the original Broadway score. The scene ends with a short reprise of the song.

    Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer, we're a notorious couple of cats
    As knock-about clowns, quick-change comedians, tight-rope walkers and acrobats
    We have an extensive reputation. We make our home in Victoria Grove -
    This is merely our centre of operation, for we are incurably given to rove.
    If the area window is found ajar,
    And the basement looks like a field of war,
    If a tile or two comes loose on the roof,
    Which presently ceased to be waterproof,
    If the drawers are pulled out from the bedroom chests,
    And you can't find one of your winter vests,
    Or after supper one of the girls
    Suddenly misses her Woolworth pearls:
    Then the family will say: 'It's that horrible cat!
    Was it Mungojerrie - or Rumpleteazer?' - and most of the time they leave it at that.
    Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer have an unusual gift of the gab.
    We are highly efficient cat-burglars as well, and remarkably smart at the smash-and-grab.
    We make our home in Victoria Grove. We have no regular occupation.
    We are plausible fellows, who like to engage a friendly policeman in conversation.
    When the family assembles for Sunday dinner,
    With their minds made up that they won't get thinner
    On Argentine joint, potatoes and greens,
    Then the cook would appear from behind the scenes
    And say in a voice that is broken with sorrow:
    'I'm afraid you must wait and have dinner tomorrow!
    The joint has gone from the oven - like that!'
    Then the family will say: 'It's that horrible cat!
    Was it Mungojerrie - or Rumpleteazer?' - and most of the time they leave it at that.
    Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer have a wonderful way of working together.
    And some of the time you would say it was luck, and some of the time you would say it was weather.
    We go through the house like a hurricane, and no sober person could take his oath
    Was it Mungojerrie - or Rumpleteazer? or could you have sworn that it mightn't be both?
    And when you hear a dining-room smash
    Or up from the pantry there comes a loud crash
    Or down from the library came a loud ping
    From a vase which was commonly said to be Ming -
    Then the family will say: 'Now which was which cat?
    It was Mungojerrie AND Rumpleteazer!' - and there's nothing at all to be done about that!
    And there's nothing at all to be done about that!
