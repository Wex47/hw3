   Eliot was a poet, essayist, publisher, playwright, and literary and social critic. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, to a prominent Boston Brahmin family, he moved to England in 1914 at the age of 25 and would settle, work and marry there. He became a British subject in 1927 at the age of 39, subsequently renouncing his American passport.

   Considered one of the twentieth century's major poets, Eliot attracted widespread attention for his poem "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" (1915), which was seen as a masterpiece of the Modernist movement. It was followed by some of the best-known poems in the English language, including The Waste Land (1922), "The Hollow Men" (1925), "Ash Wednesday" (1930), and Four Quartets (1943). He was also known for his seven plays, particularly Murder in the Cathedral (1935) and The Cocktail Party (1949). He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948, "for his outstanding, pioneer contribution to present-day poetry".

    Although Faber &amp; Faber announced 'Mr Eliot's book of Pollicle Dogs and Jellicle Cats As Recited to Him by the Man in White Spats' in their 1936 Spring catalogue, TSE had run into difficulties over his general approach. "The idea of the volume was to have different poems on appropriate subjects…recited by the Man in White Spats …At the end they all go up in a balloon,
    <span class="mw-poem-indented" key="51572a5d-5480-4457-95e4-8235deae3e95" style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 1em;">

     Up up up to the Heaviside Layer."
    </span>
    Three more years, as his publisher put it, brought "a growing perception that it would be impolite to wrap cats up with dogs” and the realisation that the book would be exclusively feline. Ralph Hodgson, the poet who bred bull-terriers, had hope to illustrate it but at the crucial period he was house-hunting in America. He felt that “the fun of doing it – or attempting it – is the thing, and that is only possible with my feet up on the mantlepiece, as the saying is."
    Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats was published on 5 October 1939 in an edition of 3005 copies at 3/6d (17½p) with TSE's drawings on the front cover and the dustwrapper. He was nervous about its reception. His verse play The Family Reunion has appeared in March and The Idea of a Christian Society was due in three weeks. "It is intended for a NEW public" he informed Geoffrey Faber, "but I am afraid cannot dispense with the old one." He need not have worried. "Cats are giving general satisfaction" the Sales Manager reported shortly afterwards. Today they have become a minor classic and are to be found in Danish, German, Italian, Japanese, Swedish, Hungarian and Polish.
    The Marching Song of the Pollicle Dogs' and 'Billy M'Caw: The Remarkable Parrot' appeared in The Queen's Book of the Red Cross in 1939; 'Grizabella: the Glamour Cat' is an unpublished fragment of which only the last eight lines were written as TSE thought her history too sad for children.
