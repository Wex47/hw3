   The concept of a Jellicle Cat was first introduced by
   <a href="T S Eliot.html" key="4abbe35c-182d-45e2-9394-70285d835a72" title="T S Eliot">

   . There are two claims for the origins of the terms "Jellicle Cat" and "Pollicle Dog". The popular explanation is that "Jellicle Cat" is a corruption of "dear little cat" and "Pollicle Dog" of "poor little dog".
   However, Eliot's secretary wrote in a 1959 letter that "Jellicle" is a diminutive of "
   <a href="Jellylorum.html" key="d51b45ba-68a6-495c-a54b-3b7c60d58ca3" title="Jellylorum">

   " being based on said cat.
   In the same vein, "Pollicle" is then presumably a diminutive of "Polly" (the name of Eliot's first wife's dog).

     "Pollicle Dogs and Jellicle Cats"
    </b>
    I was lunching on day at The Princess Louise,
    When I passed some remark to a man in white spats
    Who had ordered a plate of fried gammon and peas,
    So we soon fell to talking of thisses and thats -
    Such as Pollicle Dogs and Jellicle Cats.
    I have been, he confided, a jack of all trades,
    A true rolling stone that has gathered no moss,
    I have seen much of life, in its various shades,
    And the fat and the lean, and the profit and loss;
    I have done everything and I've been everywhere,
    (I'm at present an agent for small furnished flats) -
    But the one thing that's made life worth while, I declare,
    Is Pollicle Dogs and Jellicle Cats.
    I have been, he continued, involved with the Turf
    In the work of Accountant, in quite a small way,
    I invented an excellent specific for scurf,
    I bought second-hand goods, and I once wrote a play;
    I have acted as guide, on a Levantine Tour,
    And at one time I travelled (from Luton) in hats:
    And for all my misfortunes I've found but one cure -
    And that's Pollicle Dogs and Jellicle Cats.
    Now my sister, for instance, who lives in the hills,
    That lie on the border of Shropshire and Wales,
    In a comfortable house where her husband fulfils
    His vocation of retail purveyor of ales,
    She says, and for me I've no reason to doubt
    Her opinion, repeated in dozens of chats -
    She says there is one thing she can't do without
    And that's Pollicle dogs and Jellicle Cats.
    And my brother, for instance, who lives in the plains
    That lie on the border of Surrey and Kent,
    In a house newly built and with adequate drains,
    You would be quite surprised to know how much he spent
    On that house - he has actually had to employ
    Two men snaring rabbits and two catching rats -
    He says, there is nothing that he can enjory
    Like Pollicle Dogs and Jellicle Cats.
    Now my sister, of whom I have told you before,
    Is musically gifted, can sing like a bird,
    She can learn any tune and read any score,
    She can sing any song that you ever have heard.
    I have never known anyone had such an ear,

    He only has time at the end of the week,
    But his portraits have made a considerable stir.
    He can sketch you, in no time, almost anybody,
    From Lady Godiva to Ingoldsby Oddie -
    He can draw like Italians, or Frenchmen, or Dutch,
    But prefers to draw people with whiskers and hates:

    As Pollicle Dogs and Jellicle Cats.
    Well, I said very quickly, that's quite understood,
    So now let me order a small glass or port -
    It will set your tongue wagging, and do your heart good,
    (Any port in a storm, as a final resort):
    Besides, there's a question I now wish to put,
    Though I know what is what, and I know that is that.
    What you've said is exceedingly curious. But
    What's a Pollicle Dog? and a Jellicle Cat?

    And a man who's not heard to a Pollicle Dog
    Can't know enough even to fall off a log -
    Well, he said, at the worst there is hope for you yet;
    It's exceedingly lucky for you that we met.
    If you do not object to my talking in verse -
    Not at all, I replied, I enjoy it of all things,
    It's a good way to put either large things or small things;
    There is nothing like poetry for real monologues -
    So with that he began
    ABOUT POLLICLE DOGS.

    Fair stood the wind for France
    When the Jellicle Cat jumped out;
    But O for the touch of a vanished hand,
    And sixpenny-worth of stout.
    The farmer gave his daughter the ring,
    And the Jellicle Cat stood by,
    The face that launched a thousand ships
    Had a knowing look in its eye.
    The toadstool on the mossy bank
    Muttered aloud in its sleep;
    Jellicle Cats are Jellicle Cats.
    They sow and they also reap.
    Once more unto the breach, dear friend
    The Jellicle hosts proclaim;
    Make wing at once to the rooky wood,
    It's all a part of the game.
    Ring out the old, ring in the new,
    Jellicle Cats have got the vote;
    Helen of Troy set out to sea
    In a beautiful pea-green boat.
    Jellicles all, come blow up your horn,
    The year's at the spring, too-wit too-woo;
    Cassia buds and Venetian blinds,
    And never a spray of rue.
    Let Jellicle joy be unconfined,
    And Jellicle love bring down the sky;
    For Cats may come since Cats must go
    For an annual holiday.
    Cetera desunt ......
