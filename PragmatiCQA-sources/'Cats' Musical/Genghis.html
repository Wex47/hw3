   Griddlebone

    But most to cats of foreign race his hatred had been vowed
    To cats of foreign name and race, no quarter was allowed
    The Persian and the Siamese regarded him with fear
    Because it was a Siamese had mauled his missing ear
    ...
    And his raffish crew were sleeping in their barrels and their bunks
    As the Siamese came creeping in their sampans and their junks
    Growltiger had no eye or ear for aught but Griddlebone
    And the lady seemed enraptured by my manly baritone
    Disposed to relaxation and awaiting no surprise
    But the moonlight shone reflected from a thousand bright blue eyes
    And closer still and closer the sampans circled 'round
    And yet from all the enemy there was not heard a sound
    The foe was armed with toasting forks and cruel carving knives
    And the lovers sang their last duet in danger of their lives
    (Duet)
    Then Genghis gave the signal to his fierce Mongolian horde
    With a frightful burst of fireworks, the siamese swarmed aboard
    Abandoning their sampans, their pullaways, and junks
    They battened down the hatches on the crew within their bunks
    Then Griddlebone she gave a screech for she was badly skeered
    I am sorry to admit it, but she quickly disappeared
    She probably escaped with ease I'm sure she was not drowned
    But a serried ring of flashing steel Growltiger did surround
    The ruthless foe pressed forward in stubborn rank on rank
    Growltiger to his vast surprise was forced to walk the plank
    He who a hundred victims had driven to that drop
    At the end of all his crimes was forced to go kerflip, kerflop
    Oh there was joy in Wapping when the news flew through the land
    At Maidenhead and Henley there was dancing on the Strand
    Rats were roasted whole in Brentford and Victoria Dock
    And a day of celebration was commanded in Bangkok!

   The original London production dressed the Siamese characters in simple, generic "Asian" style robes patterned with triangular blue-eyed Siamese cat faces. The choreography included large fans.
  </p>
  <p key="55ea82cf-96db-4ddc-b052-77eac2c0dc2d">
   The Broadway production, the following year, had a far larger budget for costumes and the Siamese upgraded to some of the most intricate and complex costumes in the show. Patterned after historic Thai Armour, they included complex headdress, a broad collar with pointed shoulders, and a tabard, worn over fawn to brown ombre satin. The collar and tabard included electrified light-up blue eyes that glowed. They also gained the prop carving knives and toasting forks as mentioned in the lyrics. These more elaborate designs became the standard world-wide and replaced the simple fan costumes in the UK by the mid-1990s.
  </p>
  <p key="957ca879-c81f-40b4-99b5-7a6e9cee70a2">
   Despite the reworking of the
   Crew costumes
   and
   in the
   London revival
   , these Siamese designs remained largely unchanged until 2019. At that point they were redesigned for the

    Vienna revival
   </a>
   (as was
   Macavity
   ). The
   Asia tour
   of the following year used these new designs. These costumes strongly reduce the stereotypical 'Oriental' elements such as the exaggerated facial features, yellow 'skin', and ornamented armour and helmets, giving them a more slim and elegant silhouette and changing the palette to black, white, and dark blue.
