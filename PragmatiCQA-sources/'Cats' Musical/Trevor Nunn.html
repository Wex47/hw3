The dump reaches out into the theater, circling completely around the mezzanine rail. Against this collage, strange forms skitter and crouch, clad in fur, satin and stripes, illuminated by shafts of moonlight and neon, piercing the air with snatches of songs and animal hissings.

       With all this to occupy him, Mr. Nunn remains calm. A rather Elizabethan-looking man of 42, with dark hair, mustache and beard, he seems self-effacing, even diffident. But he grows passionate when the subject is close to his heart, and a dry sense of humor is never absent for long.

The Winter Garden is, inescapably, a proscenium house resting on solid granite. These differences, plus the low, ornate ceiling here, posed problems for John Napier (

       A: Andrew Lloyd Webber told me about his plan to create a musical based on children’s poems. I was lucky to have studied Eliot’s poetry at university. In my view, Eliot was one of the best poets of the 20th century. And the brilliant children’s poems which he wrote for fun were intended for both children and adults. But I told Andrew that if we were going to make a show, there had to be a story.
      </p>
      <p key="79f1574e-325c-4c20-8ae5-4a5d3e568000">
       The first poem that caught my attention was a poem about Jellicle cats who meet once a year for a celebration. The saying goes that cats have nine lives. Then, a series of ideas hit me one by one. The cats belong to a tribe called “Jellicle.” They meet once a year to decide who will have a new life. In a tribe there must be a leader as well as a threat. So, I searched Eliot’s poems and found

       as the threat. At their annual meeting, all the other cats would be like the dancers in “

       ” displaying their talents and saying “Pick me! Pick me!” The initial idea for the musical was much like

      </p>
      <p key="9a302156-35ba-406d-9909-7be240b01230">
       Then, something amazing happened. Just before we started rehearsing, Eliot’s widow found an extra poem about a cat which was not included in the book. It is an eight-line poem titled “
       <a href="Grizabella the Glamour Cat (song).html" key="855b966c-e097-46c0-a0df-c846500fcac0" title="Grizabella the Glamour Cat (song)">
        Grizabella, the Glamor Cat
       </a>
       .” We found a remark by Eliot on it, saying that it was too sad for children. The poem tells of an old and sad cat in desperation. She used to be beautiful, yet had lost all her sparkle. I was thrilled after reading it, as I had found the leading characters and story for the musical.

       needed a big song of her own. Webber wrote a wonderful piece of music, and I searched all Eliot’s poems, picking out phrases and writing the song called “

       .” After listening to it, the estate finally agreed to it since it does sound like Eliot.
      </p>
      <p key="ce392bc2-b4e0-4835-bf26-ffd29ed5c31b">
       The other characters were mainly created from the performers’ improvisation and Eliot’s poems. In improvising, the performers gradually discovered how a cat thinks and moves, which then became dance steps. Based on that, I searched Eliot’s poems again and started to develop characters. I gave each of the performers
       <a href="Character Descriptions.html" key="998bc9dc-b606-469c-803f-86792bfe8c87" title="Character Descriptions">

       — three secret words defining their characteristics. Then, they were required to improvise about cats with characteristics such as nervousness, fear or being overexcited.

      <p key="7865a1f1-cdcd-4487-b611-4fa8319ff1ea">
       With ready characters, relationships also gradually formed in my mind, such as friends, enemies and couples. For example, Macavity broke into the Jellicle ball because he was crazy about
