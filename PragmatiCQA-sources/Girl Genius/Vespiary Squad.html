   Their uniform is blue, green, and gold, and their Wulfenbach badge, appropriately, sports a set of insectile wings.
The weasel handlers themselves also wear face-concealing masks, perhaps to make absolutely sure they don't get wasped, and helmets which appear to be shaped like a soldier wasp's head.
Other members of the Squad (such as
   Sergeant Scorp
   ) wear uniforms similar in style to that of Wulfenbach regulars.

   During the Wulfenbach forces' retreat from Mechanicsburg, the Vespiary squad used the opportunity, at Tarvek's recommendation, to secretly seed themselves in the retreating troops so they could disperse with the remaining Wasp eaters, to begin searching for sleeper revenants and set up labs to continue the late Dr. Bren's work.
   Whether any of these teams succeeded or even survived is currently unknown; one group planned to go to
