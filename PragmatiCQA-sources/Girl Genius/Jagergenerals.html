    between Zola and Tiktoffen. Until the Higgs revelation, it was always possible that the secret General might turn out to be a Jäger who hadn't yet appeared in the comic. (Higgs could be Zadipok, but the Foglios wouldn't do that, right?)

    : As the senior Jäger, or at least one who has been kept sharp by leading a party of "wild" ones, he has been assigned the duties of a general. Wears something similar to Koppelslav, albeit colored green with an added pair of goggles. Later wears a sailor captain's hat. How do you steampunk a Fez? Crossbreed the popular Fez with a more modern army world war 1 era aviator hat.

    : As a joke the generals gave him a pathetic hat, but still let him participate in the war council admitting as a sort of equal to them, if only symbolically. However, Krosp does not see himself as subject to Agatha, but rather the other way around as her king.

    : The side effects of being removed from the Mechanicsburg stasis bubble have biologically matured him into a general, and possibly made him mentally suitable as well. He used to wear a shako, but is between hats at this time.
