   In turn, it's also the place where the Jägers literally sniff out the fact that Agatha's a Heterodyne, with all that that implies. They don't immediately act on this information, and the Circus does its thing, with Agatha playing the role of fortune-teller Madame Olga for the first time. The evening culminates with a presentation the illustrious (notorious? ludicrous? frabjous?) Heterodyne-brothers play
