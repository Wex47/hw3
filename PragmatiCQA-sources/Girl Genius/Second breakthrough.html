   The first breakthrough happens entirely in the mind/brain.  The new Spark shows newfound skill, and often newfound hostile intentions, but they are physically unchanged.  The second breakthrough is different; most importantly, it makes the Spark immortal.  The God-Spark also displays a halo made of symbols of some kind, different for each of them.  Finally, the God-Spark has seemingly magic powers (levitation, teleportation, killing enemies with sheer energy, changing size) that Snacky deploys immediately after his second breakthrough, without having built any technology to enable them.

   , are unable to experience a second breakthrough. According to
   Lucrezia-in-Agatha
   , it takes an organic mind to "find the Spark, and build it into a flame - An Inferno." Whilst ascending, she exclaims "the neural pathways are already there, just waiting", possibly implying the groundwork to the second ascension is already within the brain of any Spark - although Agatha has previously "looked out at the infinite", which may be Albia's way of implying that an incident under Castle Heterodyne was involved.
