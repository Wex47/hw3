   &gt; Sigils with wings
  </div>
  <p key="72eedb6f-28f8-4fb5-a5c6-8e25c47a785f">
   It is my theory that the wings on a sigil indicate that the person is head of their house. Additionally the winged sigil on machinery or troops signifies that they belong to the leader of the house. My theory stems from Tarvek in Stormhalten. Before his father dies the sigil worn around his neck is wingless but the sigil around Aaronev's neck has wings. After Aaronev dies Tarvek's neck sigil has wings.

   Additionally, Klaus has worn the wings from his very first appearance. We only see Gil wearing the wings after Klaus becomes incapacitated and Gil theoretically is the current head of the house.

   Agatha is not yet head of the Heterodyne family. As I am writing this Der Kestle has just come back to life and Agatha's status is unknown. We do know that in the time windows she has wings on her trilobyte sigil.

   The problems with this theory is that Beetle does not wear the wings, nor do we ever see Bill or Barry wearing the wings.

   Right after I first saw the "winged rook" sigil, I was reminded of the old Army Air Corp insignia, which was a shield sporting two eagles wings. I think the symbol is the de facto insignia for Wulfenbach because their family seat is now a Flying Castle (get it?). I think that wings on a sigil are indicative of weapons/forces that fly or are at least in the air. Can anyone confirm winged sigil sightings on forces that are

    specifically stationed
   </u>
   on land? Keep in mind, any Wulfenbach troops are detached from aerial transports.

   I just assumed that the sigil of House Wulfenbach, the winged tower, and the sigil of House Heterodyne, the trilobite, were combined to form a winged trilobite following the union of the two houses, which I had further assumed resulted from the marriage of Agatha and Gil.

   I think everybody is way too worked up about the wings. Although I don't have any theory of my own to share, I suspect you're all at least half-wrong but we won't find out until Blueprints II is

   I don't think so. Wooster is wearing a winged Wolfenbach sigil
   here
   , and he's certainly not the head of the house. I think its just a general heraldic symbol. For the Wolfenbach's a winged castle has a fairly obvious meaning, given the nature of Castle Wolfenbach.

   Apologies if this duplicates a theory elsewhere -- in fact, I'm sure I've read it elsewhere, but I can't find it here. In any event, I think this is right: I reckon that attaching wings to one's sigil indicates that one forms a part of the Pax Wulfenbachia. It's not QUITE fealty to Wulfenbach, but it amounts to the same thing. Beetle was an exception: Beetleburg seems to have been an enclave in Wulfenbach lands (or, at least, was until the death of Dr Beetle). Likewise, Mechanicsburg's ancient liberties have been recognized with special treatment under Wulfenbach rule. Sigils without wings which (under this theory) ought to have them are, I reckon, just old. After all, Wulfenbach hasn't been in charge for

   long. Thus, I agree that in

   , House Heterodyne has signed up to the Wulfenbach alliance -- or maybe the symbolism has changed by then. But I reckon that's the answer. --

   Socks: there is not a Winged Trilobite on the
   gravestone
   . There is a Trilobite with a ribbon behind it above the text, and there is a picture surrounded by wings below it, but no Winged sigil. I admit that if you don't look too closely, the picture with wings on either side might appear to be a trilobite- and that is, in the context, an understandible mistake. BUT when you
   <i key="fe8132b7-ddb4-421d-81dc-65c1dffb4d13">
    actually look
   </i>
   at it, you'll see it's a picture of a small child with its head cut off. Also note that the surrounding gravestones also have "winged pictures"; one has a book, and the other
   <i key="bf51fbe9-45f0-4c67-8f15-7aac968da66f">
    does
   </i>
   appear to have a winged trilobite on it. My guess is that those pictures represent either cause of death, or something that was very significant to that person. If the latter is true, then Klaus Barry's picture still makes sense, seeing as he had a very short lifetime.

  <p key="7be000d2-7097-496e-8432-cdc7a9dd50c3">
   Now, my theory on the whole Winged Sigil matter is basically these points:
  </p>
  <ul key="a16ea763-bfe4-4d25-b78b-b5504682aa1b">
   <li key="91df98a0-dbea-47e2-814f-92e3f472fde5">
    Some sigils just have wings, period, and they mean nothing significant, politically.
   </li>
   <li key="a2b576e3-b6fb-4c8a-aeb4-0306bc2aa13b">
    Sometimes wings on sigils indicates a rise in power, meaning that either the house itself plays a significant role, or the wearer of the sigil is significant to the house.
   </li>
   <li key="baf2fd06-5533-428c-8594-6a1dc56142b9">
    Sometimes a winged sigil signifies a joining of two houses; if house A was a... winged sword or something, and house B was a unicorn, then you get a unicorn with wings.
   </li>
  </ul>

   Personally, I support the last theory in the case of Agatha's winged trilobite, because that would mean that there was a Heterodyne- Wulfenbach alliance. :)

   Just thought of something. Here Agatha had a winged sigil, but Von Zinzer didn't. Maybe that means that Agatha,

   , has a connection to Wulfenbach, but the House of Heterodyne as a whole remains seperate. In other words, Even though they might have an alliance or whatever, they're still two distinctly seperate houses.

   Okay this might sound a little crazy (even for this forum), but when I first saw Agatha's Flying Trilobite I'd assumed that wherever she was based now was a flying...something, just like Castle Wulfenbach. Now assuming it

   Castle Wulfenbach, could Castle Heterodyne fly? Or some part of it? I wouldn't doubt the Heterodyne family could have a big airship somewhere in mothballs, just in case...

   Would Lucrezia's sigil seen
   here
   have anything to do with the wings? Given that Agatha's wearing her winged trilobite while she's got at least one geisterdame in tow, along with Gil dressed similarly, did the wings get added to symbolize some sort of merging of purposes?
