   wearing their special uniform; thus, he was apparently not part of the Black Squad itself. Even so, and despite the fact that a member of the Wulfenbach forces is likely to see many strange things in his career, simply the fact of his easy familiarity with the members of the Black Squad seems to militate against the notion of them being ghosts.

   of them being ghosts; in that case, though, we would not expect Wooster to be fooled, as his ability and knowledge have been demonstrated on numerous occasions. This doesn't, however, eliminate the possibility that in Wooster's previous career, of which we have little knowlege, he might have had experiences with the supernatural of such a nature that even something that merely suggests the supernatural would make him uneasy.

   The black squad is co-ed, unusually for ground forces. All other
   Wulfenbach ground forces
   shown so far are all men,
   with one (possible) exception.
   . One of the members, possibly an officer, is a woman. She appears earlier in Vol 6
   [1]
   - recognizably the same person as appears apprehending the supposed Heterodyne, where in the next page
   Sergeant Scorp
   calls her "Ma'am", suggesting a superior officer.

   (or, more precisely,
   Herr Vikel
   ) had a device which seemed to warp the squadmembers painfully out of existence. Because the Black Squad has previously been shown appearing from, and disappearing into, nowhere as part of their normal operations, it is unknown if this is a permanent dematerialization, or simply a temporary banishment to their usual hiding place.
