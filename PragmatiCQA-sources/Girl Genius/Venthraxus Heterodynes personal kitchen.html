   they haven't found the main kitchen yet. The room is under the control of one of the Castle's fractured subsystems, which thinks of itself as simply Castle Heterodyne
   . It is thus able to have an a floating array of kitchen utensils menace anyone currently inside it.

   The greatest priorities for the kitchen would be the food preparations and cooking conducted within it--so much so it will abort attacks for the sake of preserving a souffle. It was also the very first part of

   Sanaa also theorizes that the kitchen, in addition to enjoying mentally torturing people rather than outright killing them, has also accepted that the prisoners are trying to repair it, and have to get food
