   The visible features of the device are a blue sphere about 20cm in diameter; a brass band that encircles the globe longitudinally; a ring at the top and the Heterodyne trilobite at the equator are attached to the band; and other brass knobs, buttons, or ports (it's unknown what they are) protrude from or adhere to the globe. Attached to the lower part of the globe is a bust (or waist up statue) of the Titan Atlas as he may sometimes be depicted holding the globe of the sky. The statuette has an inverted-saucer-shaped base with at least two holes, as if it were designed to bolt onto something.

    The unanswered questions about this device, especially its apparent "invisibility device" function suggests some foreshadowing.

   It should be noted that a Heliotrope is, according to some ancient poets, an object that can make one invisible. As the Heliotrope Family has probably been in the service of the Heterodyne family for a very long time, they may have some relation to this device.
