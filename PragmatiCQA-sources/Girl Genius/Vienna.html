Not unlike
   Milan
   , early Vienna was controlled by the Longobards at one point, although the Slavs and Magyars took over the city and the area in later decades.
Eventually, the city became not just a cultural hub, but the capitol of the Holy Roman Empire.

Many of the greatest architectural works in Vienna date from the city's Baroque period.
Opera as an artform collating all manners of performance (song, dance, acting, costuming, stage engineering) also originated during this time and found a home in Vienna, sponsoring some of the greatest musicians of the age.
