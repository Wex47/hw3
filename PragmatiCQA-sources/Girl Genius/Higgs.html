   slime monsters
   , and it was on fire in the bargain. Higgs managed to stabilize the situation and escape with the splattered Baron (reasonable enough, since it's his job) as well as the delirious (and subsequently very violent) Bangladesh DuPree (which has prompted many fans to wonder just what he was thinking), breaking Bang's jaw
   in the process but incurring a few injuries of his own (a broken arm and leg plus a nasty bite). He and his charges escaped the burning airship in a launch while he was taking further damage from (and administering further damage to) DuPree. He was able to get the launch on the ground more or less safely, but on arrival, took friendly fire
   and was assaulted by a nesting goose, both of which did yet more damage. The doughty fellow nevertheless managed to recount his tale of derring-do to

   Some fans, probably motivated by the

   Higgs requests permission to leave Castle Heterodyne to get Zeetha to Mamma Gkika's.
   Tarvek notes Higgs' concern for Zeetha as well as his Heterodyne connection.

   Then Zeetha sees the man of her dreams in action.
   Der Kestle tells Zeetha how Higgs feels, but says that if she learned who he really is, he'd have to kill her.
   As Wulfenbach forces are being routed in the streets of the town, Der Kestle sets up Higgs so Zeetha can watch him fight.
   Higgs refuses to show off his true abilities and so Zeetha saves him from being trampled.
   Higgs finally says what he feels.

    Higgs appears to have an uncanny knowledge base regarding Van Rijn's Muse of Protection (or rather her body as unwillingly occupied by the intellect of the Castle Heterodyne). She (the muse/Castle) recognizes Higgs who silences her before she can say who she identifies him as, proving Higgs is a cover name, not his original one.

   <li key="b09a8638-eec6-423e-bc0c-dfc32d913af1">
    The Castle Heterodyne intelligence appears to have more than a passing acquaintance with Higgs, and the two have exchanged comments on events that are more than one typical human lifespan in the past, thus making Higgs old (some 300 years at least).

    In his fights with the Muse and Zola, Higgs survives and quickly recovers from attacks that would kill, or at least grievously injure, any unaltered human -- including being thrown into a wall hard enough to break the stone, and being impaled through the guts on Zola's sword. He is also stronger than most humans in Europa, and fast enough to surprise Zola when she's boosted by Movit #11.

There is also talk of Heterodyne succession requiring the best bodyguard available to the Heterodynes to protect said Masters until they have reproduced, assuring continuation of the family line, and can be considered disposable.

    Higgs is first encountered in a bar, at least two cellars below Mechanicsburg, and exclusively for Jägers to spend time in until a Heterodyne capable of repairing them shows up. Until then Mamma Gkika will have to do. Wait a minute! Higgs is in the form of a human in the company of what are definitely Jägers, and the only casual human mingling with the Jägers (the entertainment doesn't count; those are girls, not human men). Gasp, could this mean Higgs is a... Jäger? However, other Jägers refer to him as Higgs including Mamma Gkika. His real identity must truly be worth keeping hidden if Jägers, well-known for being (or pretending to be) idiots, either will hide his identity, or are unaware of Higgs's true identity. It appears that Dimo, though not the other two Boyz, knows and respects him.
