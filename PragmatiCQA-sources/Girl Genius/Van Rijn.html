   Van Rijn was mysterious even in his own lifetime, with only the man's own word regarding his supposedly Dutch background. He also went out of his way to avoid having his picture painted, and so (in universe) no image of him exists.

   , after Van Rijn's death (or at least disappearance, see below), many people wished to study the Muses, but the work was extremely delicate. Since these are Sparks we're talking about, this didn't stop anyone and some of the Muses were said to be tragically destroyed.
   To date, we've learned that five of them at least escaped being completely disassembled, though some are now rather the worse for wear. One of them,

   . When finally released 200 years later by Agatha and Co, Andronicus considers this a betrayal, stating that Van Rijn witched him away from a battle at his moment of triumph, while Prende claims it was done to help him. Considering Andronicus's notable physical condition at the time, it was likely an attempt to preserve his life while a cure was sought for said condition.

   In any event, after sealing away the Storm King, Van Rijn then plotted to imprison The Enigma inside the Hermitorium, either to get help for Andronicus or to extend his own life, or both; the capture was successful, but did not result in an increased lifespan for anyone: Van Rijn in fact evidently

When she revives the nearly-dead/defunct Enigma, the latter individual labels her deceased captor a "presumptuous old lecher" and departs for parts or times unknown. (What a... productive... couple of days Agatha's been having!)
