She adopts "widow's weeds" when learning a former colleague,

    Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom
    celebrated the 60th anniversary of her accession to the British throne in 2012, while the
    ocean liner that shares her name
    was retired in 2008 after forty years of service. Elizabeth II is now the longest-reigning British monarch in history. In January of 2020 her reign surpassed that of
    Franz Joseph I of Austria
    , and in May 2024 it will surpass that of
    Louis XIV of France

    "Albion" (Greek: Ἀλβιών) is the oldest known name of the island of Great Britain. Today, it is still sometimes used poetically to refer to the island. It is the basis of the Scottish Gaelic name for Scotland,

    bears a similar resemblance to depictions of the Celtic queen
    Boudicca or Boadicea
    . Her red hair matches the description of the Roman historian Cassius Dio (although he pointed out she wore a golden great Torc), and her spear is similar to that of the famous sculpture

    However, taking in mind her great age, animal skin clothing, curly hair, and shape, she may be based on the statues such as the Venus of Willendorf
    Venus of Willendorf

    Given that Lady Astarte claims that Albia's memory of the Queens' Mirrors dates back to a time, "...before the [English] channel," we can deduce that Albia has been the Queen of England for at least 8,200 years and was part of a hunter gatherer culture that spanned northern Europe at the end of the last ice age. The
    English Channel
    only came into being with the submergence of
    Doggerland
    6,200 - 6,500 years BCE as sea levels rose after the end of the
    Pleistocene glaciations
    . This means that Albia would significantly predate Boudica -- although Boudica might have inherited her spear from Albia. The present day island of Great Britain has only been
    continuously occupied
    since the end of the
    Younger Dryas
    cold period 11,500 ybp, so if Albia predates then, she must have been among the first permanent settlers there, having been born elsewhere. Of course an English monarch born outside of England is
    par for the course
    .
