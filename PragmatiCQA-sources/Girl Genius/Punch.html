   , Punch as originally created is very strong
   , but flawed in that he shows obvious signs of being a construct, in his specific case including his huge size and being a mute, although the last is not generally known and the Punch featured in Heterodyne Boy stories speaks.
   It is perhaps those flaws that might have helped disguise him and Judy in later years, for while some might see that he was a construct, they also might not accept that this 'imperfect' work could be the product of the legendary Heterodyne Boys.
   Being active in the Heterodyne Boys' adventures, he has acquired some impressive fighting skills, including being able to 'flick' metal rivets at near bullet speeds with a high degree of accuracy and control.

   When Punch and Judy kept Agatha in hiding with them as their foster child, they went by the aliases Adam and Lilith Clay.
   Adam
   was the name given to the first man in the Bible, and some myths refer to
   Lilith
   as the wife of Adam prior to Eve. Given that some creation accounts refer to humans being fashioned from clay, and that the medieval story of the
   Golem
   also refers to its being made from clay, it appears that the aliases chosen for Punch and Judy were intended as an ironic reference to their status as constructs. We have no explanation for why the name Lilith was chosen, other than that it would have been less obvious than Eve, though it does raise another interesting point for fan discussion on

   Their actual names, of course, are references to
   Punch and Judy
   , characters from a traditional English puppet show dating back to the 16th century in the real world.  Similar shows actually exist in the Girl Genius universe
   , but whether the names are used in that context is unknown.
