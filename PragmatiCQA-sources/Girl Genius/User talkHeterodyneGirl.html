   Hi Welcome to the wikia. Thanks for your contributions.

   To keep with our policy on main pages and forum pages I have moved your discussion of Agatha's love life to the forum name space. That allows for the openest free form comments. The main pages are constricted to following canon and to being sort of formal. It would be appropriate to have a main page too. Its format would have to be a little different from how you started (Which was very good by the way.) If you want to restart one in the main space that's fine. Please check the

   Hi! It's always nice to see someone else who is enthusiastic enough about the Girl Genius saga to contribute to this wiki. (I only started actively participating in it a relatively short time ago myself.) I see that you have edited the
   Open Questions
   page, marking the question below as answered:
  </p>
  <ul key="c8bb1353-e870-4b86-8fba-a36ea44c8cfa">
   <li key="16dcad0c-e9cf-478f-aa73-e6a3ca95f4a4">
    Who was responsible for the near-destruction of Castle Heterodyne, how did it happen, and what were they trying to accomplish?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p key="3d303178-e7ed-4b9f-80db-8f609b6e3b41">
   And giving the answer as:
  </p>
  <ul key="15ff0fb1-cbcf-4fb4-bc84-a5f6077e30a1">
   <li key="30fedc98-3091-4ea8-a808-9457fbf2f4ec">
    The Other destroyed the Castle, and kidnapped Lucrezia
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p key="9e684fa2-3c97-4b10-af58-2a0829d6db9f">
   I think you might want to reconsider this, since what you are putting down as an answer really isn't one. The idea that the Other destroyed Castle Heterodyne and kidnapped Lucrezia is what most or all of the characters in the story believe happened, but we, as readers of the story, have reason to think there is more to it than this, and, therefore, to expect a better answer.
  </p>
  <p key="c087beeb-6f49-421e-a580-fba31821c46f">
   We know that Lucrezia is the Other now. It doesn't make much sense to say she kidnapped herself. Was someone else "the Other" when the Castle was destroyed? If so we don't know who that was, so saying it was the Other is the same as saying "Heterodyne Castle was destroyed by some party or parties unknown," that is, it's not an answer at all.
  </p>
  <p key="0927d354-32fa-43f2-8475-cab9eb576840">
   There is also the matter of Klaus Barry Heterodyne's death. Did Lucrezia kill her own son? And you don't address the matter of how the destruction of the Castle happened, or what that destruction was supposed to accomplish. Until we know much more about this incident, I don't think this question can be said to be answered. --
