Even if the queen is not involved, one would think the daughter of Klaus Wulfenbach would be at least a little sparky. Build a nice death ray or two, that sort of thing. However, it may just be a genetic fluke, and female sparks do seem to be significantly rarer. (Is that partially genetic or does that have to do with kidnappings {theory is that the Geisterdamen know of a female Heterodyne heair and are kidnapping girls searching for her} and pitch-forked mobs?) --13:33, September 14, 2009 (UTC)

   The Breakthrough for a Spark only happens young in rare cases. She might just not have had her breakthrough yet. Additionally the Spark seems like it can mean different things for different people. Examples show in the Sparks in the Circus (Magician, Baker, Perfumer) and her whole education seems to have been hurting people and breaking things. Another possibility is that the sickness she had when leaving home was the preliminary stages of a breakthrough and her breakthrough was the killing of the whole pirate fleet. Her gift might be inspiration in ways to kill people. She also might not know how to use it yet. The people of her homeland might not know as much about the spark.

   1. As seen in the prologue of “Agatha H and the Airship City”, the Other (Lucrezia) launched meteors at targets in Europa from orbit, followed closely by the hive engines that descended on parachutes; this means she had access to some form of space (or at least interplanetary) travel.

   2, Lucrezia ‘traps’ Klaus in Skifander after drugging him were he apparently fathers Gil and Zeetha. We have seen much weaker sparks drill through the earth, navigate the oceans, and fly in airships. If Skifander is on Mars, it makes sense that Klaus would be stuck there, and it is within Lucrezra’s power to do this (see 1).

   3. The city of Skifander never shows any outdoor shots (Domed city?), is always depicted in red, and is called “Guardian of the Red Mountain” (Olympus Mons?) – There are no red mountains on Earth.

   4. Agatha’s Uncle Barry remembers Skifander and tells the story of it to Agatha as child after being prompted by: “They had gazed at them (The stars at night) together, and Agatha had said something about the night revealing her hidden jewels.”

   7. When Olga describes Zeetha's illness after leaving Skifander in 'Agatha H. and the Clockwork Princess:' “On the journey here, she got really sick. Feverish. She doesn’t remember anything about the trip – except the hallucinations, and from her description, they were pretty awful. Floating around, furniture on the ceiling – wild stuff.”
   Zero gravity anyone?

   3 Yes there are [

   10. The Russian "skafandr" is actually a loanword from French scaphandre, which means "diving suit" - does this rather point at some kind of reference to Atlantis??
