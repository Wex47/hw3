   The war ended about a year later (which is to say for unknown reasons The Other stopped attacking), concurrent with the Heterodyne Boys' disappearance, but after nearly two decades the aftershocks still haven't died away.

   The Other seeded attacking swarms of slaver wasps by dropping them via parachutes from someplace Way Up High, followed by a bombardment of boulders upon the targeted Spark's lair and the surrounding countryside. Bill and Barry learned this by predicting and observing the attack on one Lord Womak, the so-called "Lightning Eater". They were able to kill the wasps, but the boulder bombardment went off as scheduled. Assisting in the clean up and recovery was the last time the duo was seen in public.
