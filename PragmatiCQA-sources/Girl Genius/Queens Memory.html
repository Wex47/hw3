   The Queen's Memory contains not only the modern memories of Queen Albia, but also her oldest memories, reaching back before the creation of the well itself. These memories are reasonably vivid, perhaps implying that they always remain as "fresh" as the day they were originally placed into the well.

   The user interface of the well takes the form of a giant, slightly transparent projection of Albia herself. This projection takes the form and personality traits of Albia as she was at about the time that the retrieved memory was placed; for instance, when she abruptly shifts from older to more recent memories, she also

   consciously in control of everything that the well is doing, since otherwise she would be able to directly choose what memories should or should not be shared without a failsafe. This implies that the interface of the Queen's Memory is more like a construct, or perhaps a copy of the Queen's mind. However, this copy seems very current, since it appeared to be aware of Agatha, Zeetha, and Gil's arrival in England, even when Gil visited it only a few days later.
