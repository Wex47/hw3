   , Gil figures it out: the Dihoxulator simply isn't going to work, at least not according to the plans that Klaus gave the good professors.  This provides the opportunity for one of those father/son bonding moments that Klaus relishes so much (Gil less so), explained by Merlot: the whole thing is a test devised by Klaus to see whether the Spark burns as brightly in Gil as it does in himself.  Gil passes with honors: he's sufficiently sure of himself that he's willing to face his father's wrath and stand on his convictions that the Dihoxulator is a piece of junk, as Klaus knows that it is.  Klaus commends his son for his strength, and all is on the way to a sweetness-and-light ending ...
