   Phase 2, which equates to a stereotypical cackling mad scientist, appears to be the standard mode of operation for sparks. Hyperfocus tends to be triggered either by emotional upset or by concentration, and sparks quickly move into Phase 2 after a short ramp-up in Phase 1.
Sparks tend to drop out of Phase 2 to sanity (or what passes for it) once the stimulus is removed or if they are sufficiently distracted, but Sparks in Phase 3 usually need to be

   initially seemed to have locked him in a continuous madness place. However, once Gil arrived in England (and was therefore not continually managing the Wulfenbach empire directly), he began spending more time in a normal state. It is possible that this is due to a "retreat" of his father's overlay, since most of his actions at this time don't influence the health of the empire so directly.
