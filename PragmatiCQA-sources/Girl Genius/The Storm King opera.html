   The second act features the Storm King's legendary Muses, a "bawdy" Jägerchorus, and the "intricately choreographed Rescue Dance," where Andronicus attempts to take Euphrosynia away from Ogglespoon, as well as the "Lover's Duet," apparently inspired by the sound of the mating call of the Irish Elk. Ogglespoon recaptures Euphrosynia, however, and traps Andronicus in a "
   bonsai hedge maze
   ".
    The act closes with Andronicus vowing to search for Euphrosynia forever.

   In our world
    Salic Law
    , which we are likely safe in assuming is applicable here as well, forbids the inheritance of any powerful seat of authority by an heiress. It also only permits the inheritance to be passed down through the male legs of a dynasty. Otherwise suitable heirs need not apply. This latter fine point was established after a hundred years of warfare, known today as the Hundred Years War, between England and France.
    Edward III
    of England laid claim to the French throne through his mother's,
    Isabella
    's, side of the family. She had been
    Charles IV
    's sister. Lest you think of Edward III as being grasping, he was not by the standards of the day. King Charles IV had inherited the throne of Navarre through his mother. Salic Law was as applicable in Navarre as it had been in France.
