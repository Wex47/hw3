   In the modern day, the (nominal) border between Moldova and Ukraine roughly follows the
   Dniester
   ,
and historically, Moldavia was (often
   ) separated from Parts East
   by it.
Moldova/Moldavia

That is, the western part of historical Moldavia (sometimes called Moldova) is immediately east of Transylvania and is still part of Romania.

   modern border between Moldova and Ukraine
   is to a great extent occupied instead by the breakaway state of
   Transnistria
   .
Since the early 90s as the Soviet Union fell apart... anyway, Transnistria is a thing.
The point here is that in Transnistria there is a particularly lawless
   region near where Mechanicsburg is situated that sits on a river whose name begins with the same letters as "Dyne".
  </p>
  <p key="9ecd6754-279f-4990-a5b1-779a23504153">
   The actual headwaters of the Dniester are near
   Drohobych
   , which claims the world's oldest saltworks and was in the mid-19th Century Europe's largest oil extraction center.
It lies in far western Ukraine, hence near Poland, as well as Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania.

  <p key="e5b0fcd3-b576-46e4-b0df-d8f8b1653f39">
   However, according to the map of the
   Mongol invasion of Europe
   (1220s-1230s), the town of
   Halych
   , further down the Dniester, was the hub of the invasion.
Unlike Mechanicsburg and the Heterodynes, though, this started the decline of Halych and it seems the Mongol Empire itself not much later.

Mediaș is not near the headwaters of either of those major rivers —it sits on the Târnava— but the nearby area of
