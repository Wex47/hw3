    war stomper
   </b>
   is a large (up to very large) armored vehicle which uses ambulation instead of wheels or treads to move across terrain. This provides not just substantial intimidation factor, but the ability to have stomper personnel be out of range of smaller weapons or personal assaults.

   War stompers have a variety of assault options - the most obvious is actually stepping on opponents and their structures or gear. Larger units which can handle the recoil may be fitted with various sorts of artillery, and depending on insulation and heat sinks, energy weapons as well. As with most fine machinery, each unit is hand-made and therefore there are no two identical war stompers — but they do follow some general design similarities.

   at night. The legs attach through the lower hull to the engineworks. This hull also provides a main deck with a railing suitable for protecting deployed riflemen who are, in turn, protecting the stomper from artillery positions and possible leg assaults. There may be additional rifle positions at the first joint of the legs as well, to provide for more complete angles of fire. These are only assigned to the best and most adaptable sharpshooters who never suffer motion sickness.
