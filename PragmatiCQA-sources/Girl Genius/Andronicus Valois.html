    Hulk-like
    dimensions, with glowing yellow-green skin, and the ability to wither or age human appendages that he comes in physical contact with. From his point of view the enraged Valois went directly from the midst of a major battle (which he believed he was about to win) to the present-day Paris catacombs with no sense of the passage of time, and he believes van Rijn personally "witched [him] away." Upon being freed, he has a brief conversation with Agatha, wherein he sees no familiarity in her, and assumes she is a Heterodyne minion, instead of being the Woman Herself.  He then remotely reactivates the Lever and proceeds to use the Solid to smite his way upward towards it through solid rock, with Prende in tow after her begging to be taken along.

He was evidently at least partially successful, and the clash of the Lever and the Platonic Solid leads to an energy burst that knocks Valois off his feet (and sends Tweedle flying away). Some of Tweedle's troops attempt to take advantage of this and attack, but this perceived act of cowardice merely results in the angered Valois unleashing a blast from the Platonic Solid that turns them all into his loyal undead soldiers, an ability he has due to Bludtharst Heterodyne corrupting his weapon.

Upon hearing her voice (and despite their previous meeting), the now thoroughly mangled and skeletonized king mistakes her for Euphrosynia, leaving him open to a final punishing blow to the face from Tweedle. He collapses to dust, leaving behind his crown, which Tweedle promptly claims as part of a

   overlooking the opposing Heterodyne forces as he prepares to marry Euphrosynia and thus cement a peace treaty with Clemethious and his son (Euphrosynia's brother) Bludtharst Heterodyne, in theory ending years of bloody warfare.  Euphrosynia was evidently originally intended to marry an unnamed Heterodyne ally before catching Andronicus's eye and agreeing to marry him via an exchange of diplomatic missives.
    The Muses appear and inform him that his bride-to-be is a cats-paw for Clemethious, and will (at least attempt to) betray and destroy him. It is too late for him to change his plans, and he proceeds with the wedding. It should be noted that in this scene he bears little or no resemblance to the figure who emerges from the vault under Paris 200 years later.

   Andronicus seems to be an analogue to the real-world
    Louis XIV of France
    (1638–1715), who was known as the Sun King.  Among other things, Louis XIV was known for working toward a centralized state and propagating the belief of a monarch's divine right to rule, an ideology which seems to resonate with the Storm King's followers as well. However, Louis XIV was a Bourbon; the
    House of Valois
    ruled France from 1328 to 1589. Additionally,
    the five good emperors
    is likely a reference to the Roman era of the same, during the
    Nerva-Antonine dynasty
    .
