   After his arrival, his presence causes Tarvek and Higgs to start making short, random hops forward and backward in time between frames of the comic, Tarvek more than Higgs because, we soon learn, Higgs' extremely long life anchors him somewhat in time.  Kjarl borrows some time-stability from Higgs to give to Tarvek. He also comments that Tarvek is scheduled to go mad at some point. This all deals a fatal blow to the whole "thwarting" plan, and the other Being finally snags Tarvek with a flailing tentacle, cutting the conversation short.

   shaped like a watering can over something looking like a patch of plants when he was shifted out of his own and mostly into our plane of existence. Perhaps these "plants" are the smeerps. Or maybe he was simply watering whatever substitutes for plants in his native dimension.

   Following the shift, he evidently spent thousands of years (of our time) in the temple over which the Queen's Society Dome was built.

   And so, he's also been lurking about the dome before we and Our Heroes get to meet him; he was able to communicate with the now late
   Professor Homlomium
   , and his out-of-dimensional-phase presence evidently provoked stories of "The Boilerghast" among the other dome inhabitants.

   On the other hand, it's not necessarily the case that all actions that might have been attributed to the Boilerghast are due to Kjarl.

   It seems likely that the name Kjarl Thotep is a play on words based on
   H. P. Lovecraft's
   fictional extra-dimensional horror
   Nyarlathotep

   The 'smeerps' he was a friend to are a reference to the Turkey City Lexicon and its description of a trope of bad writing,
   "Call a Rabbit a 'Smeerp'"
   - a term for having an ordinary animal/object/concept but calling it an exotically alien name. The Professors are not the first to play with this; Larry Niven did the same, literally naming a rabbit-like alien in
