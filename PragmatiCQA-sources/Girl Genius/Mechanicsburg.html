   On the other hand, the Dniester (see
   The Dyne#The Dniester
   ) also rises from the
   Eastern Carpathians
   , but on the northeast side (so the plains are to the east).
Hence the city of
   Drohobych
   , in the
   Ukrainian Carpathians
   near
   the source of the Dniester, which city also boasts ancient saltworks and fossil (fuel) extraction, may be alluded to as well.
Invasion from the east suggest the eastern side of the mountains as a stopping point, and indeed the map of
   Mongol invasion of Europe
   shows
   Halych
   , further down the Dniester, as a hub of that invasion.
