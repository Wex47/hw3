   Mnenyver and I were discussing Skif elsewhere, and I pointed out some curious similarities in Skif and Geistersprach (yes, I know, they aren't trying to be Tolkein here; play along with me, OK?).

   There's already a strong suggestion Gil is half-Skifandrian, whether closely related to Zeetha or not. What if, as some have already put forth, there

   some connexion between Skifander and the Geister-realm (perhaps the Geisters are the REALLY lost ones from some long time ago), and Gil is the fulfillment of an old legend from before the split in the populations about a male Princess who will be lost and found again?

   If he were shown as being consort to their reborn Goddess, that would cement his position in a feminine culture even further, especially if he was gracious enough to play into it.

   I was wondering about Gil's wardrobe choice in those portals myself. Then I remembered he'd lost his clothes as the JagerGaarden and had to find spares (and one whopper of a hat), so what if something similar happened while he, Agatha, and Lars had been visiting Geisterland? That would also explain where they found "portal" technology; we see the Other in a portal in the beginning of the strip, seemingly experimenting with the portal generator, and we know that "she/it" had an affiliation with the Geistermaidens.

   My impulse is to go with the most basic theory until I have more clues. What I infer from what Bang saw is: Agatha, pretending to be posessed by Lucrezia, infiltrated the Geisterdamen, bringing Gil with her disguised as a Geisterdame (and presumably Moloch as a prisoner); since then, something happened, and at least some of the Geisterdamen now acknowledge Agatha as their master, and now serve her and not the Other, which is why it was safe for Gil to partially remove his disguise among those Geisterdamen.

   Of course, none of the Geisterdamen seemed to recognize that Agatha wasn't the Other besides Vrin.  And now that Vrin's dead, it would be easy to convince the rest that she's the Other because of her voice, as the geisterdamen last the Other occupying Agatha's body.  And if Gil dressed up as a geisterdamen and was seen following Agatha, there would be little suspicion that she wasn't the real thing.
