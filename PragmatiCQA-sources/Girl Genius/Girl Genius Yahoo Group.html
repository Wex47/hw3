   The group was first formed in July, 2001, when
   <i key="60ed70a2-31af-4bb8-b092-7a23ce8eea62">
    Girl Genius
   </i>
   was still being published as a quarterly print comic.  When
   the Professors
   made the move to webpublishing almost three years later, the message count began doubling for each successive month for the next three, with a peak in February of 2006 of 2828 messages.  The increased traffic from the more regular release of new material caused handfuls of group members to complain that they could not keep up, their inboxes were being overloaded, et cetera and these former regular posters left the group permanently.  From that peak, the dull roar has decreased to an average of 800+ messages a month, with some noticeable dips during the holidays when non-canonical or other vacation material is run instead.
