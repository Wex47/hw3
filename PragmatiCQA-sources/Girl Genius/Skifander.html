   "Skif" is a Russian word for Scythian
   [1]
   — militaristic, semi-nomadic tribes that ruled the Eurasian steppes in antiquity. It can also refer (again, in Russian) to a supposed ancestor, Scythes, a son of Hercules in a legend reported by Herodotus or a son of Zeus in a legend reported by Diodorus Siculus. In passages 4.28.2-4 to 4.28.4 of Diodorus Siculus's (partially surviving) work of universal history,

   The Scythians occupied the

   between 8 and 4 BC. According to the

   Quite a bit more has been hinted at than actually spelled out in canon. For example, as noted above, it has been confirmed in an interview

   Baron Wulfenbach's statement that he "kept [Gil] alive" hints at the old story that Amazons (to whom the tribeswomen of Skifander bear more than a passing resemblance) kill all of their male children. Whether this is accurate, of course, would be known only to Zeetha, to whom the question has not yet been put. Klaus has been shown in flashback grimly crashing through a Mirror gateway with an infant in his arms, indicating that for whatever reason his departure from Skifander was not a peaceful one,

   Zeetha’s reported “hallucinations” in the novelization suggest that at least part of her “fever” was due to motion sickness in a low-gravity environment, implying that Skifander may be extraterrestrial, cf.

   In addition to Zeetha's "hallucinations," Skifander was (re-)discovered by one Professor
   Guylian Consolmagno
   , who is likely based on the Jesuit astronomer and physicist Guy Consolmagno. This may lend extra weight to the theory that Skifander is on another planet. Lucrezia and the Heterodyne Boys could have accessed it through the monolith/mirror under Mechanicsburg. We may never know how Prof. Consolmagno got there and back, though the
