   The term "canon" implies that the authors of an ongoing fictional work agree to the conceit that the world which is described in the work has an objective reality.

   In the vast majority of fiction (i.e., poetics, and not to mention writing in general), the world is assumed to be our own world.
   The world of the work, then, deviates from our world only as articulated within the work itself.  One example of limited deviation from our world is the
   <i key="1aa436cf-54f2-4aae-bc94-d19ea95f7b59">

   universe, which adopts the conceit that the fictional world is the future of our own world.  Other examples can be found in the Steampunk writings of authors such as Tim Powers.  Powers is reported to follow historical reality to the extent that it has been recorded (and thus accepted with little controversy), but then add details to allow a supernatural interpretation.

   There are, however, schools of philosophy (and, in particular, Continental philosophy) that propose that no objective reality in fact exists.  In a fictional work created according to such a school of thought, fictional characters would not inhabit a fictional objective reality.  Some of the uncommon features of

   , a relatively successful modern explanation of Catholic sexual moral teaching, takes a phenomenological approach. That is to say, rather than assuming an external reality from which truths can be deduced, it takes human experience to be primary.  Of course the pope himself was a theist, but he was able to work within a continental philosophical milieu.)

   By examining only the body of an oeuvre itself, one can draw negative/null conclusions, such as "these are inconsistent or unrelated".  However, there is a good argument that it is impossible to formally support positive conclusions on this subject within a set of works themselves.  Accordingly, it is useful to focus on statements by the authors about the work, which, in the case of

   is a work of serial fiction, where early parts of the work were distributed (and thus ceased to be revisable for consistency) before later parts of the work were created.  The distribution of serial fiction is becoming cheaper and cheaper as technology advances from multi-volume novels to magazine serials to daily web pages to RSS feeds.
