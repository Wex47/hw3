There is at  least one lake or pond on the island, which drains to the sea via a waterfall plummeting from the plateau's edge. The flat top of the plateau is heavily forested and dotted with ruins. There is also some sort of man-made structure at one spot at the base of the plateau amid the waves, but it's currently impossible to tell exactly what it is, both a dock and some sort of bridge have been hypothesized.
