   Lady Lucrezia Mongfish Heterodyne, ravaged Europa, destroyed forty-three major Sparky houses, and harried the normal citizens with slaver wasps and the resulting shambling revenants. During the attacks, accusations were thrown around at various candidates, only to see those on the list of candidates being targeted, until the moniker

   (which would create both warrior wasps as an initial strike force and slaver wasps to begin terrorizing and subjugating the population), followed by a direct strike on the target itself by high velocity kinetic weapons, and finishing with an attack using the revenants created by the Hive Engines.
   At the time, it was believed that all revenants were mindless "shamblers", easily detected zombie-like creatures. However, most revenants were actually normal humans in every respect, except that they had been mind-controlled to obey the Other's orders. This fact was never discovered during the war, and presumably became a major strategic advantage for the Other.

   According to reports, the Heterodyne Boys did everything they could to destroy wasp infestations and foil the Other. While some people assume that the Heterodyne Boys won the war, all that can be said for certain is that one day, the devastation stopped and the Heterodyne Boys disappeared. Afterwards, Baron Klaus Wulfenbach returned from exile, suppressed the ongoing fighting, and began collecting all devices produced by the Other for disposal and/or study.

   (it should also be noted that Sparks' immunity was a deliberately placed limitation of the technology, not inherent, and thus somewhat easier to improve).
   The other known improvement, the miniaturization of hive engines by
   Count Harken Maganox

   Gil considers these events perplexing; he does not believe that improved versions of the Other's devices could be produced without her input, but he has seen no new devices by the Other herself, which is unusual for sparks. It is notable, however, that none of Lucrezia's current copies are known to inhabit a spark, other than the version currently trapped in Agatha's mind. It is therefore possible that non-spark versions of Lucrezia (such as the one in Zola, or in the fake Anevka) are secretly running the current Other war. Such copies would presumably remember technical details about the construction of hive engines, but they would not have the spark necessary to invent new modifications to the same.
