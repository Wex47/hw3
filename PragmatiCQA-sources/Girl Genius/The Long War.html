    The Long War

   The Long War became inevitable as alchemy grew into science, and Sparks began to seize power from the prior feudal warlords. One might presume that a fear of "witchcraft" with the possible backing of a strong Church kept alchemic Sparks from gaining much power before. But as science and technology became the respected force, those who were able to wield it became the nuclei for new and sometimes fleeting series of empires.

   Eventually everybody was fighting everybody else; it made it easier on the historians, but not the peasants.
