   The total length of the Carpathians is over 1,500 kilometers, and the mountain chain's width varies between 12 and 500 kilometers.  The highest range within the Carpathians are the Tatras (between Poland and Slovakia) where the highest peaks exceed 2600 meters in elevation.  The
   mountains have been divided
   into several orographically and geologically distinctive groups for scientific purposes.

   No area of the Carpathian range (in our world) is covered in snow year-round and there are no glaciers.  With Sparky interference, this is easily likely to have been altered.
