   Beetleburg appears to be the Inner Eastern Carpathian Mountains. This city appears to be on the upper reaches of the river Olt, possibly in the location of our current-world
   Miercurea-Ciuc
   , which interestingly enough is home to the
   Sapienta
   Transylvanian Hungarian University.

   Another possible candidate could be
   Sibiu
   considering its size and status as a centre of culture and education.
  </p>
  <p key="d210483a-8517-42f8-9047-10991bb015a4">
   Both locations are fairly near the most likely locations of Mechanicsburg; indeed Sibiu itself has been proposed  as a possible location of the latter town.
