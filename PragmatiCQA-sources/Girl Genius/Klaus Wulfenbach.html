   style
   . Klaus's spark is more abstract than most:  He has the gift of analysis and synthesis, which allows him to identify Sparks simply from their creations, and on a more pragmatic level, allows him to match up personnel with their most appropriate and fulfilling job functions. His preferred application of his ability is the study of the Spark itself, which he does, in part, through

   indicate that he would prefer to simply provide a Spark with the tools they need and observe them over a long period of time. But Othar, being who he is, is far too dangerous to give resources and was moved straight to destructive testing.
    We have at least one example of his intention to

   His Spark allows him to study the technology of others, which he then adapts and improves for his own use. This often means the end result is "bigger and better" than the original concept. (Castle Wulfenbach is an excellent example.) His 'bigger and better' tendencies with other people's inventions tends to allow them to be weaponized as well, if that wasn't their purpose in the first place. (Fire-fighting equipment able to freeze objects solid and make materials brittle.)

   As a man of science and education, the Baron not only maintains his studies, but occasionally contributes to the body of literature in the areas of his specialties.  According to his son, the Baron wrote
   a monograph on how to communicate in the workplace
   .  It was received with a great amount of... excitement.

   Like all Sparks, Klaus has his "amusing quirks," such as a love of

   and a tendency to infect himself and his son with every disease and poison he can find as proof against assassination attempts. Seeing as they are still alive, this may actually be a good idea.
    He claims at one point that every woman with the Spark that he has ever known has tried to kill him; whether this is a result of his spark or a more fundamental personality issue is left to the reader

   Klaus makes a deal with his son Gilgamesh where the latter allows him to install a "personality overlay" which has the effect of preventing damage to the Empire or to Gil himself, with Agatha seen as the primary threat.
Everyone agrees that Klaus's personality overlay is "not really him", but it is distressingly similar to what Lucrezia does nonetheless.

   much about his background, beyond the fact that he came from a place called "Europa", and he ran away from the city when Zeetha was only a month old. One reason she came to Europa is that she was looking for him, although it is left ambiguous if this a personal quest, or part of her official mission.

   During an online interview, the Foglios revealed that Skifander has a bias against twins, strongly implying that saving Gil's life was the reason for Klaus's departure. (Even in the print novel, it's again not made clear if Zeetha's family has ever given her a reason for Chump's leaving, or if before meeting Gil she even knew she had a brother.)

    The Castle of Wolfenbach

    and published in 1793. The Wolfenbach in the story is a Count, not a lowly Baron.

  <p key="229f1c72-f583-4382-abfc-b0b30a51df8b">

   For those unfamiliar with
    nobility rankings in Europe
    , a
    baron
    is the lowest rank, and a baron's fief is typically about as much land as one can see from the top of their castle. It's possible that is what gave Klaus the idea to use a patrolling high-altitude airship as his "castle", as one can see just about all of Europa from the top of
   <a href="Castle Wulfenbach.html" key="d13d09a3-28b3-4494-a0e9-cc5a63a71f68" title="Castle Wulfenbach">
    Castle Wulfenbach
   </a>
   (if not all at once). However, given how Barons are supposed to answer to higher nobility like Counts, it's doubtful that Europan nobility is impressed. Intimidated, possibly, but not impressed. Not that Klaus cares.
