   It is mentioned upon their first appearance in the comic that the Knights are all wearing
   Dr. Eg's Nerve-Enhancing Armor.
   Initially, they were only shown as human when wearing said armor. And to date, whenever a Knight removes his armor, he immediately converts to his wolf-shape.

   Lacking any specific in-comic confirmation, this led to two alternate fan-theories:

   <li key="e8e0f4e1-4d6c-4cbc-9f42-ab6cb5b931d2">

   <li key="75558c05-7d84-406e-873b-0e1e6e790b56">
    The armor has nothing to with the transformation, and must be shed simply because it no longer fits the Knight's frame as he transforms.
