For one, the guy doing the telling is one of a collection of identical clank puppet-duplicates via which Beausoleil remotely interacts with the world; this first copy remains intact just long enough to distract Agatha's companions and allow another to kidnap her. She is taken to meet Beausoleil's nominal boss

   Before long, another layer of truth is peeled back: Drusus is in fact working for the Master in some official capacity, and dragged Agatha into contact with Du Quay in a covert effort to both thwart the man's plans and assess her abilities. This works quite spectacularly, but with the unfortunate side-effect that Agatha and a stolen piece of

   has learned of her father's death and who is responsible. She appears before the Master-killing body and with an enraged snap of her fingers, destroys all of his other incarnations within range of her power. In true Sparkish fashion, she employs every last method now at her vast command, and Beausoleil experiences every last bit of the attached agony. He nevertheless survives this, and declares that his actual physical body is not even in Paris. Colette comments that while he will survive for now, he will also have to deal with his presumably highly-displeased master(s), an assessment he nervously agrees with. She destroys the Master-killing body, banishing Beausoleil from the city.
