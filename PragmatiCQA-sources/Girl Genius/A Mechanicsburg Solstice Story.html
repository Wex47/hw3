   became the Heterodyne. The Professora hears enough that her academic curiosity is aroused, and she goes off on her own to investigate. She gets over-enthusiastic about this quest to the point that she volunteers to Revelsmeister
   Ignitheus Plumm
   to stand in for Agatha, who has left town on short notice to deal with a problem in
   Zagreb

   , except for a mysterious waif who offers up a glowing horned crown. Accepting this adornment means that the wearer is hunted through the streets of the city by bands of his/her own citizens, trying to avoid being caught until dawn. It's never made exactly clear what hunters do to The Heterodyne if they are successful; maybe nobody knows as supposedly it's never happened. Kaja probably wouldn't have lasted long, except it turns out that since she's not really The Heterodyne, the Castle is for the first time ever still active, and helps her evade capture. They discover that Plumm has been scheming to let Agatha/her stand-in get caught and then sell a whole warehouse's worth of tacky "I Helped Capture The Heterodyne" merchandise. They set the warehouse on fire, and Plumm immediately runs afoul of his numerous creditors. Agatha returns from Zagreb at dawn, the
