   From the tenor of certain comments made by the staff and judging from the decor of the interior rooms, it probably is also a Jägerbrothel.

  <p key="cdecd820-5e28-4000-b205-d7ff1bffd93c">
   Furthermore, Mamma Gkika's also functions as an underground (figuratively, as well as literally) medical facility. Since the Jägers won't let anyone but a Heterodyne operate on them (since a Jäger is considered to be proprietary information, even by the Jägers), Jägers who get too banged up to fight come to Mamma Gkika's to recuperate.
   (AN: given the extraordinary resilience and healing properties of a Jäger, it's rather terrifying to think of what has to happen to make a Jäger unable to fight). Mamma Gkika "patches them up," using some rather sparky medical devices
   and a hefty dose of
   Battle-Draught
   , so that they are stable enough to be properly repaired by the Heterodynes, when they return. Given how many Jägers seem to be in the bar at the current time,

   Being Jägers, they need more than just booze to keep them happy. As a result, Mamma Gkika has effectively scheduled an Evening Bar Fight to let them blow off some steam. The one time this is seen, she takes the stage, but tells them all to wait till she blows her whistle.
   Van says that they were lucky that it wasn't Thursday night, which would be Poetry Slam Night,
   . What that is, we don't know, and are not sure we want to; where Jägers are involved, the "slam" may be all too literal (to say nothing of the poetry). (Meanwhile, at the tourist trap upstairs, the patrons loudly sing well-known polkas.
