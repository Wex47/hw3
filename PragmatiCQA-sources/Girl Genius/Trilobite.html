    trilobite
   </b>
   is a (presumably) extinct
   arthropod
   living over 300 million years ago in prehistoric seas. Trilobites are prolific in the fossil record, with nine (or ten) orders having been identified and over 15,000 species in those orders. Like other arthropods, they had multiple body segments and jointed legs joined to at least one segment.

  <p key="d33f17d5-8ef3-49cd-8bbf-7db269c446e9">
   Trilobite fossils can be found in the rocks of all continents, and other than missing the finer, delicate structures such as antennae and legs, are frequently found in good condition. The smallest specimens can be only a millimeter long, whereas the largest found are over 70 centimeters. They are composed of a cephalon (head), made of various fused sections; a thorax composed of freely articulating segments; and a pygidium (tail). The

   as the trilobite is entirely open to speculation, as word does not seem to have survived the centuries. Could it be that some Heterodyne ancestor saw how prolific and widespread the creatures had been, and declared that the Heterodynes would likewise blanket the world? Or could it be that he saw them as hardy survivors, and vowed his family would be likewise? Either way, the trilobite, stylised into a generic badge form, has proved to be an easily-identifiable and utterly distinctive symbol of a House equally distinctive.

   Peel and devein the trilobites. Place heads (if you still have them), and peels in a small saucepan and add water. Bring to a slow boil over medium-high heat and boil slowly for 15-20 minutes. Strain and discard the heads and peels. Retain the stock.

   Place the oil in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot and place over medium-high heat. Add the onions, peppers and celery and sauté, stirring often, until the vegetables are very soft, about 45 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, salt, peppers, herbs, sugar and trilobite stock and return to simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and let simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. This is your creole sauce and it can be prepared 1-2 days in advance and stored in the 'fridge. The flavors improve after sitting a couple of days.

  <p key="b40da869-3df5-4e66-afb7-19fef3ae1114">
   When you are ready to serve, return the sauce to a simmer and add the trilobites. Cook until they turn pink, about 7 minutes. Stir in the green onions and parsley and let cook for 1 minute more. Serve on rice.
