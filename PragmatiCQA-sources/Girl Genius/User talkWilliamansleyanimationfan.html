   Hi thanks for your corrections to the recent page edits. If you are interested there are a few tasks I am hoping to see someone adopt. First I would love if someone wanted to take over the current page summaries that I am currently doing. I can go into details if you are interested. It mainly consists of doing 3 edits a week as each page comes out and then a fourth edit to adjust page breaks and prepare for the next week. I originally took it on to see what needed to be streamlined. Of course by doing it I got it added to my regular plate of chores. I enjoy it and it adds zest to reading the pages. My problem is at some point in the next three months to a year my ability to edit the site will be gone as a result of some oncoming life changes. So I would love to find someone willing to enjoy this task.
  </p>
  <p key="84fa21c3-5000-44ca-b647-e83b408b863a">
   Alternately, Volume X and Volume XI have many sections where the entries are incomplete. So it would be good if someone would volunteer to tackle backlog. Usually it is pretty easy to complete one section in one editing session. If either of these tasks interest you let me know and I will provide further details if needed.
  </p>
  <p key="ee3ac828-3047-4e60-8604-696be7ed6c32">
   The better task to get ones feet wet is helping to get Chrono X and XI up to date. That consists mostly of picking an uncommented section. Calling up the pages. Noting the details in the character, text, quotes and extra's field then summarizing story on that page in the action field. Per section the characters tend to repeat so cut and paste works well. For a summary you can either roll your own which you may find more satisfying or refer to my weekly notes
   .

   Keeping the pages current simply means doing the same thing for current pages. While Argadi is right that no one needs make a commitment, this task does means everytime the Foglio's put out a new page then an update will be needed. Experimenting I found out it is easiest to do it as I first encounter the page. Not too much work at once and of course if I do it on time everyone can enjoy it soonest. The Foglios can be

   You (unless there is a highly unusual coincidence) commented on Girl Genius Labs recently that you wanted to read the books because you didn't want to wait 13 years to get to the end. I have some bad news—the professors have said that Mechanicsburg scenes would be the end of the first third of the story, so the expectation would be 26 more years to get to the end of the comic.

   Templates can be tricky to deal with. And development can be complicated by Wikia's caching of pages (at it's whim). It is sometimes useful to add ?action=purge to the end of URLs to tell Wikia to throw away the cached version for the page and read all of the templates again.

   I'm trying an experiment. I have created a Google group to serve as a central clearinghouse for reporting and tracking errors in Girl Genius.
  </p>
  <p key="d8d58e22-4f26-45de-93ad-14326b782521">
   The idea is to reduce the number of duplicate error reports sent to the Foglios and to give those Girl Genius readers who are interested a way to see if an error has already been reported. If enough people participate in this group, then—ideally—the number of error reports the Foglios see for any given mistake that readers spot in the comic will be reduced to one.
  </p>
  <p key="acff12fa-646c-40c0-9957-01f9e8e5bb71">
   The types of error I am talking about are:

   <li key="1f8b86dd-b524-41de-8f37-3a2eb7fc959d">
    Update errors, such as missing updates from any of the regular places the comic is too be found: the main website, LiveJournal, Facebook, Deviant Art, etc.
   </li>
   <li key="28390054-080d-4deb-8cc5-7909cc04f7ec">
    Website errors such as broken links, missing files, website down, etc.
   </li>
   <li key="de8240a8-0452-4e4e-a881-a0569b5f0ad7">
    Text content errors such as typos, misspellings, or punctuation errors in dialog balloons or in the text in the drawings

    Art errors, such as Martellus von Blitzengaard being draw with a flesh-and-blood had in place of his mechanical one. More minor art inconsistencies, such as the change of a character's eye color should not be reported.

   A moderator, initially me, will send an email to the Foglios for each error, crediting the first person to report the error, unless they prefer not to be so credited. If the Foglios or their agent desire to subscribe to this group, they will, of course, be allowed to.

   I'm not very wiki-literate.  About the picture, it's so big that the Lars text was in a really narrow column and the only way I could find to fix that was to make it not be next to text, but on a line by itself.  You seem to have solved the problem with a less drastic method.

   Do we get to program things like the "recent activity" widget and the recent comic page discussion links?  It seems like someone, likely you, updates the latter by hand, because it doesn't always change quickly.  And for the former, I wish it didn't include things marked as minor edits.  How is the page programmed?  Can we write Javascript for it?

   I agree with everything above (as another non-lawyer) but I think it is important to note the the Professors won't ready the wiki for legal reasons (they don't want to be accused of stealing ideas) so they haven't reviewed it in detail to see if it matches their idea of fair use.

   Sorry about jumping the gun on the edits and not realizing that there were punctuation conventions in place.  Just for background, I had to stop regularly reading GG about 4 years ago, and decided to get back into it by doing a big re-read.  I thought I'd help out along the way as I encountered errors.

   I have a question about the links on names in the chronology.  In some cases, each occurrence of a name has a link; in others, it's only the first occurrence on the page, or within an area of the page.  It seems extravagant to have every 'Agatha' as a link, but what then is the rule of thumb?  I ask this now because the section I'm reading has a few names that definitely need links, so I'm planning to edit them.

   I renamed the page "Lord Womble" to just "Womble" (leaving a redirect for the old name) because I recall you saying that leaving out personal titles was the new standard here.  That all worked fine.  But when I type "womb" into the search bar, I expect "womble" to appear in a popup below it.  But that doesn't happen until I type the entire name "womble."  What did I do wrong?  Thanks!

   I rolled back your changes to move (!) and (*) to the beginning when I noticed you did them after I wrote the explanation (sort of) why they are suffixes in the
   Chronology Sigils Key
   . They could go first... if you're going to do that, you might as well get rid of the parentheses? I'm assuming nothing actually makes use of them (it would just be me?) which would have to be updated. And should define a stacking order, like !&lt; for "sparking in flashback", which is why they were suffixed "&lt;Agatha(!)" ⚙

   I have my preferences set to dark mode, and this doesn't work well on the Chronology pages:
    This happens because the template sets the background color but not the foreground color.  See

   P.S.  I'm wrong; I don't need to know about dark mode.  I should just set the font color to black whenever you set the background to some light color.  Is it okay for me to go ahead with that plan?

   I noted that you removed the final period (".") in my location when you updated the stub entry I made to the chronology, so I went back and reviewed previous entries for this volume: Many end with a period and many don't. It's a minor point, but it would be nice to be consistent.

  <p key="244523b0-7260-4943-8c4e-d95a479a6347">
   My current thought is that without a period is a better approach. If you agree we should remove the period in the example in comments at the end of the page.

   I'm confused. When you edited my entry you removed the final period, but when you added the entry for a new week you included a period. Is there a pattern I don't see, or do you think it an issue not worth worrying about?
