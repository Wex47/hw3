Presumably, Barry didn't want Agatha to start acting "Sparky" until she was old enough to deal with whatever she made the first time out. (It's also been commented that female Sparks in Europa have a nasty habit of simply disappearing...) It's further noted in the novels that the device was probably intended to be a temporary fix, but then Barry went away on his mysterious trip, from which he never returned.

   In the print-novel version of this scene, Klaus correctly IDs the device as being Barry's work, and mentally describes it as being the most sophisticated thing his former friend has ever made.
