   In the game, two or more players try to fix a "machine" and pop out pieces until one player wins by accumulating enough points, as awarded by a number assigned to each card. There are 108 cards in the deck, and 12 are played on a "board" at one time. The game is designed for ages 10 and up.
   The rules are available online as a PDF file
   .

   launched to fund the project quickly met and surpassed the requested $30,000. Unlike the original, there are no "sneak preview" characters, instead having four different sets of cards, each covering a different segment of the existing plot up through
