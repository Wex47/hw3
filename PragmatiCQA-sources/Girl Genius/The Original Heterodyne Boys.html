   In the story, they were on the way to rescue the fair maiden Miss Becky from the clutches of arch fiend
   Dr. Mongfish

   Unbeknownst to him (but beknownst to us), the pair, and their sidecar motorcycle, were transported to a seedy bar in the interdimensial city of Cynosure. Encountering a variety of bizarre men and creatures, the two heroes found themselves being threatened by one who was upset by his spilled drink and wanted their blood as a repayment. As that this was ‘indubitably’ an evil doer, they executed ‘Plan 4’ striking down the assailant, killing him to their surprise.

   Talking to the barkeep, they revealed that were empowered to maintain the kharmic balance and were dutybound to defeat any evil doer, anybody who was not ‘good’, though normally the villain was simply defeated and imprisoned for a short time.

  <p key="69faeff9-0eca-4380-a100-ee4b89186112">
   The fight was prevented by the arrival of Phaeton, Lord Protector of Cynosure, who felt the presence of two 'Avatars' of good (as they were in their home dimension). He explained that they simply could not lose against evil. As that their world did not have the shades of grey present in Cynosure, they would certainly devastate the bar and probably successfully take on the entire city if allowed to continue. Using his powers as Lord Protector, he transported them home to their universe, but not before turning down their offers to 'assist him' in his duties.
