   "Troth" is an old word for "oath," and is sworn by all followers of the Heterodyne. Only after an extended period of service did the Heterodynes offer their subjects the Jägerbräu, demanding trustworthiness to the point that they considered

   One major significance of this concept is that it underlines the nature of the bond between the Jägerkin and the Heterodynes. The loyalty that Jägers feel for the Heterodynes is not the unthinking command we see with revenants — Jägers have been known to talk back to Heterodynes if they feel something is important, they’ve been able to make bargains with the Baron Wulfenbach without Heterodyne approval, the Generals have been pursuing their own agenda regarding
