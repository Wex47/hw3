   Witch is a tall, female android with a curvy figure. She has long green hair that is braided and wears a black dress along with a visor that covers her eyes and has "E4" etched on it. She usually walks barefoot and seems to have painted nails.
   Without her visor, Witch's face is described by Rebecca and Homura as beautiful.

   Witch's first main outfit is a black, half-cut, long-sleeved dress. The dress has yellow stripes with a deep cut in the back exposing her back, grey sleeves, and a heart-shaped cut in the chest exposing Witch's cleavage.

Sister then jokes it's possible the people who lost their lives will be seen in 1,200 years. Witch and Sister then express that they are happy to see each other again. As both droids watch the happy reunion between friends, Sister comments to Witch that she finds the New Demon King to be quite odd.

Homura confirms this and reveals that just like Sister and Witch, she has no idea where her master had gone and wishes to find her like the rest of the group.

Witch confirms this and explains that Mosco was programmed to help with chores on the ship before the Star Shines separated for Sister to add that the fake Sister took Mosco and reprogrammed him to follow her orders. Sister then angrily explains she found Mosco lying in that church filled with bullet holes and hotly expresses that whoever did that to Mosco deserves the same treatment. Mosco then expresses happily to please take good care of him before trying to push the "Don't Push" button on his stomach and watch along with everyone else as Sister hollers at Mosco to not press the button.

They talk about Witch staying on the ship, and how it was defended by Elsie, who Sister remembers as the little girl who attached herself to Ziggy.

   After Shiki, Rebecca, Happy, Pino, Sister, Weisz, and Mosco find Hermit, Sister notices something wrong and orders Mosco to bring her on board. Once Hermit is on the ship, Witch and Homura rush to the infirmary where Sister explains that Hermit isn't responding, but her vitals are normal. Sister further explains her healing won't fix this, and Weisz adds in his Ether Gear can't fix this either. Witch concludes that Hermit's heart has been damaged. Happy and Homura wonder if Hermit went through something traumatic while Shiki asks for a way to save her. Witch and Sister admit they don't know how, then Shiki suggests they go inside Hermit and fix her heart, which baffles Rebecca and Weisz. After the crew shoots down Shiki's idea, Shiki claims he feels bad for Hermit and begins to cry. Witch then realizes something and then commends Shiki for his idea, bows in respect, and claims that Hermit's mind may actually be on the planet

   Witch explains that Hermit is in "Dive Mode" which means her mentality is in a digital world. Sister then explains that Digitalis is both a virtual dimension and a real planet, which confuses Weisz, and it's a super virtual planet where the physical body has no influence. Witch claims they all must dive to access the world. She explains that the game was abandoned when the NPCs became self-aware and the game became impossible to manage, but the society continues as if populated by normal people. When asked why  Hermit would go there, Witch answers that Hermit used to like the game, but it's still possible to log into Digitalis. Witch also expresses she trusts Shiki's instincts, to which Shiki promises that he'll save Hermit.

   The crew, except Witch, Sister, and Mosco, make their way to the Dive Room, wearing specialized diving suits, and enter the diving pods. Witch explains that they will only be able to take in their real-world abilities. She then warns them that any damage sustained in Digitalis will affect their physical bodies. Shiki claims they know the risks and are ready to go. Witch begins the dive sequence and logs the party into Digitalis.

   Later, on the Edens Zero, Witch asks the unconscious Hermit why she would close her heart to everyone before Sister gets her attention to tell her that there is some foreign data hiding in the ship's software. Witch realizes that they were being hacked, then comments that the ship's security was the best. Sister corrects her by explaining that The Edens Zero's security was the best when Hermit was in charge. She then explains to Witch that they need to keep an eye on the recent hacking, because it could effect everyone who is currently in Digitalis.

Hermit begins to stumble thanks to not using her body in so long, only for her to brush Witch and Sister's efforts to help her off and leave the room, still not trusting of humans or droids who serve humans. During the crew meeting, Witch tells the others Hermit use to have a great smile and cheerful personality. Suddenly, Spider hacks into the Edens network which causes Witch to yell in distress and scream for Hermit to help as she is the only one who can beat him. Spider soon sets The Edens Zero to destroy itself, so sends Weiz and Sister to fix the damage done

During their travels, they come across Captain Connor who had recently lost his ship and allow him to board the Edens Zero until he could find a place to go. During his stay, Connor proves to be problematic, although Witch tolerates him, until he began to steer the ship, causing Witch to revel in anger. The crew soon arrives to the helm and discovers that Connor managed to get through the debris field and cut their journey to Sun Jewel short, much to everyone's shock.

Homura explains the reason they left her remains behind was because she was a symbol of hope to Sun Jewel, and they want her to stay as a beacon of hope. Sister venomously tells them they should've brought her back because she could fix her. Sister then explains she could also build Valkyrie a new body and upload her memories from the cloud storage, only for Witch to tell her that it wouldn't be Valkyrie anymore because she wouldn't have the same emotions from her memories.

Witch asks her if she's certain about taking this position as its difficult, but Homura accepts it.

Sister was about to snap at Witch, but soon noticed Witch was silently crying. Witch then explains to Sister how she envies Hermit's ability to express her emotions, but since it's just her and Sister right now, it was okay to cry. At that moment, Sister broke down in tears, and hugged Witch as both droids mourned Valkyrie's death.
