   The party notices a commotion outside the inn so they go outside to see what the commotion is about. Then, they notice, just outside of Crysta, a large horde of monsters slowly approaching the city. Both the party and the townspeople are left wondering what's going on when one of the goblin creatures starts blowing through a war horn, before swiftly being crushed by a fearsome avian monster. The monster introduces himself as

   , and claims that they will be taking the town of Crysta by the order of Jamilov. The townspeople protest against what's happening, then Guiron repeats what Jamilov said, that the monsters can kill the NPCs, but they must take the players alive as he wants to execute them personally, then they can turn Crysta into a city of monsters.
  </p>
  <p key="56be2bad-b19a-4d3f-a496-49ab4d1494cc">
   Shiki demands to know what will be gained from this, and Guiron continues saying that when the city of monsters is complete, Jamilov will slaughter them all, to which the monsters believe there is no greater honor. Guiron orders the monsters to advance on the town and kill all the NPCs. The NPCs run away, but Shiki charges directly at one of the large monsters and throws it at the other monsters. Shiki then notices a horde of flying monsters heading for the hill Hermit is sat on. Shiki tells the group to take care of things here and flies off to the hill, much to Weisz's chagrin. Rebecca and Happy, in his

   Homura contacts Jesse to make sure he is alright and tells him she wants to finish the job quickly. She asks for Jamilov's location and Jesse tells her he is in the forest. He asks if she's really going to just abandon Shiki and his friends, and Homura claims that they're not bad people, but they've served their purpose.
  </p>
  <p key="39affaa6-ba6b-4c6d-8ed3-1857cd199fbe">
   Hermit, who is still sat on the hill, notices the monsters approaching. She dejectedly claims that she'd rather it end this way than being killed by humans. The monsters surround her and she closes her eyes and says good night, accepting her fate. However, Shiki arrives in the nick of time and picks her up.

   Meanwhile, in the forest, Jamilov is eating a piece of meat and Homura approaches him. Jamilov asks her if she should be out here when the town is being attacked and says she has a lot of nerve facing him alone. Homura then asks if he works with Drakken Joe, which he confirms. Then Homura asks if she can join his ranks, claiming she'll do anything.

   Shiki, carrying Hermit, remarks how close their encounter was. He then notices the monsters chasing after them. He launches a barrage of

   on one of the monsters. Hermit recognizes this as Ziggy's power. Shiki claims Ziggy taught him, but Hermit still asks how he took it from Ziggy, saying she doesn't trust humans and to put her down. Shiki tries telling her not all humans are bad, to which she claims that humans don't have hearts. Shiki agrees that maybe some don't, but he still claims that she is his friend because she was friends with Ziggy, to which Hermit doesn't respond to.

   Back in Crysta, the crew is fighting off the monsters to the best of their ability, with Weisz and Pino armed only with sticks and complaining at being unable to use their abilities. The monsters chase down the NPCs, but a kid trips over and is about to be killed, but she is saved by the same monster the crew met on the road, now named the Trollburglar. He claims that as the city's guardian spirit, he will protect the town. Guiron argues that he is just a local sub-boss, and questions that he would dare defy Jamilov. The Trollburglar shoots back, claiming that Guiron is a Sub-Boss himself with no backstory. Guiron complains about that, then he is quickly knocked out by Shiki. He leaves Hermit with the crew and runs up to the army of monsters, claiming he will kick all their butts at once. The Trollburglar tells the girl he saved to get all the townspeople and go. The girl thanks him and calls him "Burgle", but their path is blocked by Jamilov, who has a horde of monsters with crossbows behind him. Jamilov orders all of them to fire on the NPCs, but the Trollburglar steps in front of them and takes every arrow shot. He claims he is the town's guardian spirit and falls on his back, seemingly dead and the little girl starts crying.

   Jamilov berates a monster, telling it to hit the human NPCs. Then someone takes the monster's crossbow and aims it at the crying girl. They fire an arrow at the girl, but Shiki saves the girl in the nick of time, but he takes the arrow in the shoulder, much to everyone's shock. Hermit claims that the girl is just computer data while Shiki grunts in pain at the arrow stuck in his shoulder. Jamilov turns to the individual and claims that he didn't think they would go as far as killing their ally to meet Drakken Joe. The crew look at the person who fired the arrow and sees it is none other than Homura, who claims that Shiki is not her ally, much to his shock.
