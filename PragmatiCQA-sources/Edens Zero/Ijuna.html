   She was a member of Oasis and the daughter of the previous leader. One day she asked Laguna if he believes in the red string of destiny, which she states that she does and thinks that the man of her destiny, tied by an invisible thread, is somewhere in the cosmos. She then states how the red string is a bond that ties souls together and that it links a person to someone else, even if it cannot be seen. When Laguna jokes that it is linking her to him, she blushes and expresses her annoyance of him.

Stepping on his head, she insists that he keeps listening and continues her that after enduring such days, she realized that the prince was lonely, where he has never loved anyone and has never been loved, not even by his own father.

However, Ijuna reveals that it never worked on Shura and her powers do not work on targets who have never known love, stating that her love for him was one-sided. She then hugs him, telling him that the spark of love has kindled inside him and herself, and that her false love for him eventually turned real. When a crying Shura retorts that he is a monster, she tearfully admits that despite everything he had done to her, she is garbage enough to truly love him.

   that, when touched by someone, binds the victim to the nearest person to them and causing the two to immediately fall in love with each other. However, when the string connecting them breaks apart, it changes that love into hatred and forces the victims to fight each other until one of them is dead. Ijuna can also utilize these strings to tie up a person, thereby preventing them from moving.
   These strings can also be used for either defense, by weaving them into a physical barrier, or offense, using them to pierce through targets with incredible destructive power.
   However, it does not affect people who have never known love.
