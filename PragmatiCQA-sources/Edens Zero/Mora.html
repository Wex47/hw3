Mora is surprised when Shiki used his strength to uproot the tree and hit him with it, sending him flying. However, Mora produces the adhesive substance from his arms and legs to catch himself on the two nearby trees and then uses the springing momentum to fly towards Shiki. He strikes the boy directly in the stomach with his cane, destroying the tree along with it. Seeing Shiki using his

   When a charging Shiki demands his reason to kill the bots, Mora explains that he was just doing his mission. After Shiki declares that bots have hearts and punches him in the face, Mora phases through the attack with an adhesive body and finds his words to be a load of rubbish. He then beats Shiki down with his glue-imbued kick and calls him ridiculous, stating that the only thing good the machines are good for is being smashed and they are lower than humans and they are infinitely worthless pieces of scrap. However, Britney and Orc stumble upon Mora in the middle of a mission as she scolds Mora for the offending remark about machines and reminds him that Orc is half-machine. Mora explains to his teammates that Shiki was being rude to him.

   Mora declares to Homura that anyone who defies Beast will be deemed an enemy to his emperor, Poseidon Nero.
   After overhearing Homura's outspoken intention to find a place free of fire, Mora comments while jumping down the tree's branch that he likes the sound of it because he just loves kicking people when they are down. He then attacks her with his glue projectiles from his cane. Mora watches Homura cutting down his adhesive attacks with

   after she declared that she won't fall for the same trick twice. Tapping his cane into the burning ground and set it on fire, Mora reveals his Ether Gear to be Glue Tear and uses Hot Melt to spray Homura with a rain of burning adhesive. He gleefully laughs at Homura's pain after being struck by his Hot Melt technique.
  </p>
  <p key="adbfdce3-bb9e-4395-94e0-79617cd3844c">
   As Homura continues to suffer under Holt Melt, Mora states that it's hot and could burn her up not just a few seconds neither. He also adds that his glue will stick to her forever. Mora asks Homura, who fell on her knees in pain, about her crew as he notes that they are not tourists on Foresta, but then shrugs that it does not matter. He states that death is what comes to those stupid enough to challenge his emperor, Poseidon Nero. Mora tells Homura that if the rest of the crew are like her, then they are a bunch of nothings, and mocks them as stupid fools who don't know how the world works. Sneering, Mora states that every one of them with their idiotic expression babbling about saving bots and hearts which he sees as naïve and wants to vomit. Suddenly, Mora is surprised when Homura stands up in defiance and declares to him in a rage that she can endure the pain and the heat but she cannot bear insult to her friends.

   After hearing Homura's words of defiance, Mora tips his top hat and notes that she does not give up. He points his cane towards a tree trunk on the ground nearby and uses his glue to grab it and swing it towards Homura while laughing. Mora is impressed to see Homura cutting through the tree trunk before charging at him, which he blocks her Soul Blade with his cane. He mocks Homura's words of resolve to be so cheesy and pushes her back. When Homura uses

   . He explains that he can turn his body into glue and states that none of Homura's blades are working on him. Retaliating, Mora kicks Homura and slams her into a tree, taunting her to not go down so easily. As Homura frees herself from his glue, Mora reveals the truth to her that he finds no fun in destroying the robots and sees them as nothing but scrap with their faces looking the same. He adds that it is humans what he wants, taking sadistic glee in breaking them and seeing their faces of fear and despair as they die. With a crazed expression, Mora demands Homura to show him that face and grabs her by the neck despite being stabbed in the chest, reminding her that it does not work for his Glue Body.

   He is pleased to see the face Homura is making under his grip and drips scalding adhesives from his Glue Body onto her with a sadistic laugh. Suddenly, Mora is pelted with dirt by Homura kicking the ground to him. He spits out the dirt from his mouth in annoyance. After Homura reveals her intent, Mora asks what is the point of doing it as it does not hurt him at all, annoying him further. He is surprised to see the large mass of debris sticking to him after Homura points it out. Thinking he realizes what she is up to, Mora deduces that she is trying to stop him from moving so she can run away. Freeing himself from the dirt, pebbles, and wood chips, Mora gleefully tells Homura that it is too bad her attempt failed and explains that he can turn off his Glue Body whenever he wants to. He taunts Homura to see the despair in her face. However, Mora realizes too late that he was tricked and is struck down by Homura with her
