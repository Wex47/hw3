   Xenolith appears before a heavily injured Shiki and tells him to unleash his gravity. He explains that gravity is the weight of the heart and that Shiki's heart has not yet reached the abyss.

He states that true gravity transcends even concepts as it is the weight of the heart where it sometimes allows him to make others' hearts fall inside him or sometimes attract a young woman from the future for its power is that great. He adds that its force is infinite and that it makes it powerful, as well as dangerous. Sensing the conflict escalating on Foresta, Xenolith comments that the other machines are making a racket and sees it for himself.
   Using Magimech Attack: Gravity Center on a massive scale, Xenolith affects the Verdant Planet and pulls all caught by it to the ground. Removing his hood, he explains to an astonished Shiki that he stopped everyone in Foresta from moving for a while before revealing that he is the founder of the Magimech Arts and was

   After the reveal, Xenolith expects a bigger reaction from Shiki but tells him to tone down his shock after the boy complies. The short machine explains that he did train Ziggy, commenting that the Demon King was a natural for mastering every move the very day he taught him as if he had known the techniques all along. He confirms to a nervous Shiki that he did die, or rather his human body did. He bemusedly comments on Shiki's other reaction at him being a ghost and explains that he was a human who lived in the Dark Ages, as one of the

   , and claims that his selling point was his wild image as a human, and he was popular with the ladies back then. Assuming a crane stance, Xenolith tells Shiki that for reasons, he now lives on in the mechanical body that the young man sees before him. The short machine asks Shiki if Ziggy is the one who taught him how to use his Satan Gravity which the young man confirms. Xenolith is annoyed that Ziggy is teaching his techniques all over the cosmoses without regard, and notes that he should have had it patented. Changing the topic, he informs Shiki that Ziggy has fallen to

As smoke emanates from his robot body, he tells Shiki that there is no time to explain, and yells at him to get off the Verdant Planet before falling on the ground as he deactivates, confusing the young man. Amidst the destructive laser pillars emerging underneath the Verdant Planet, Xenolith is carried by Shiki who is heading back to the Edens Zero with his friends.
   His deactivated body is still carried as they dodge the beams exploding from the planet,

He explains to the crew that he was in danger of being infected by the virus that affected the machines despite his greatness and temporarily transferred all of his personality data into cloud storage. When a skeptical Hermit asks of his identity, Xenolith wonders if Shiki told her but brushes it off. Pointing his finger at Shiki, Xenolith explains the truth is that he made contact because he has a favor to ask of the Demon King's grandson. Xenolith states to Shiki that this is something only he can do.

Xenolith states that Ziggy fears him and corrects Shiki that he is an old run-down machine now and could not hold a candle to Ziggy in his current state. He reveals that Ziggy is truly afraid of his encounter with Shiki, fearing that he would make his grandson stronger. Clenching his fist, Xenolith declares that he will grant Shiki his power and tells him to find Ziggy and defeat him.

He remarks that at any rate, he is surprised to see such an impressive facility on the Edens Zero. The short machine explains that 7 days is all the time he has left and will use them to get Shiki and his friends into shape. After

Explaining to Happy and Pino, he reveals that his scheduled maintenance is within 7 days, and in this time, the maintenance is going to last a little longer so he will train them for 7 days. Xenolith comments that besides, depending on what Ziggy is plotting, they may not even have that long. Brushing it off, he tells Shiki to run and declares that everything starts with basic physical fitness.
   Xenolith tells everyone to stop their conversation and keep running, stating that when the running is done, he will train them to overcome the

When Rebecca is about to leave, he calls out to her as the

   Supervising the crew's training within the VR Training Facility, Xenolith asks Weisz if he ever tried aiming the gun after seeing his erratic shots on the target dummies. He points out that Weisz did not control the recoil and pulled the trigger too hard, stating that the young man will never become a marksman that way. Turning to Homura, the short machine tells her to keep her pivot foot in place which the young woman complies. A sweatdropping Xenolith remarks that Rebecca still can't activate her Ether Gear while still being bound in a ball of rope. He blocks Shiki's strike with his right arm and compliments the Demon King's grandson for improving his movement quite a bit. Then the short machine throws down Shiki on the floor easily, telling that he's far too light. Xenolith tells Shiki that the gravity is the weight of the heart and that if his heart is stronger, gravity gets stronger. However, Xenolith warns the young man that he will also need inner tranquility to endure that weight. In other words, the short machine tells him that Shiki must strike a balance between strength and tranquility of the heart or his gravity will fall into darkness, advising the young man to never forget.

He offers them to come and see him anytime and will train them again if they want. When Witch asks him about how he met Ziggy, Xenolith tells them that it would have been 100 years ago and does not remember it. The short machine comments that the last time he saw the Demon King was 15 years ago as Ziggy told him that he was on a quest to find Mother. While complimenting the
