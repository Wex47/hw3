   Holy is a flirtatious woman, as she lamented to not have taken down "little Drakky" and teases "little Justice" to be a stickler for rules and being in love even though that went straight over his head, feeling a bit jealous of "precious little Elsie".
   Holy is also an outspoken woman who sees the big picture as while she doesn't mind Justice's pursuit of Elsie, she reminds him to take the bigger threat of Nero and his son Shura seriously, and advises her fellow Interstellar member to let Jaguar and Eraser help him instead of doing it alone.

  <p key="8c5ff20f-ee72-42de-80b0-4cccd85e5acf">
   Holy is shown to be very secretive and places personal matters on a higher priority, being busy with another agenda, making her unable to help during the Aoi War.
   When she met up with Shiki and his crew, she puts on a motherly and kind image in order to win them over.

She describes Deadend Crow to be a monster who sees humans as his toys and it is enough reason for him to join Ziggy. The female Interstellar member proposes that she will help the Crew of Edens defeat Ziggy in exchange for helping her defeat Deadend Crow.

But on the other hand, Holy states that Justice can't stop her from joining forces with Shiki and Elsie. The commander retorts to Shiki that attempting to ask the Celestial Judge to stay out of the way will backfire as soon as he knows Elsie is involved and comes running. Noticing Connor, Holy calls him out and notes that he is a fugitive from Lendard, interrogating the captain. She is confused that Connor was working on an all-android planet and learns from him that Ziggy hired human professionals from all kinds of fields to have their knowledge and skills scanned for his

   much to her disgust. Holy asks the captain if he saw Ziggy which she hears that Connor flew past a giant bot that he assumed it was the Demon King's new weapon during his escape from Lendard. Glaring, she informs Connor that it was Deadend Crow he encountered and that his epithet is the "Titan of Eternal Darkness". Holy reveals to the Crew of Edens that Deadend Crow is 420 meters tall and describes him to be "a living fortress".

   When a displeased Elsie expresses her suspicion towards her, Holy tells the Galáctica member to forget about Justice and points out that Ziggy has a powerful army, stating that their enemy have the numerical advantage even if Elsie's space pirate fleet and the Edens Zero join forces. With a cheeky face, she offers to add her Interstellar Union Army fleet to increase their chances of winning. As Hermit explains the strategy to break through Lendard's defense zone, Holy chimes in that she will give orders to her Midnight ships from the Edens Zero. Watching Elsie's shocked expression at Deadend Crow being on Ziggy's side with vindication, she states that it is better to have more allies on their side.
   Holy silently listens to Hermit explaining to everyone in the Briefing Room about the pattern of

   Later, Holy privately contacts her two subordinates

   who are in charge of her Interstellar Union Army forces, addressing their concerns of teaming up with two Galáctica members that Feather already knows and reminding them to do as she instructed. She tells them to show their enemies the power of the Midnight fleet and wait until the time comes for the "immaculate military operation".
   However, she is shocked when huge swarms of

   Regaining her composure, Holy orders her fleet to eliminate the Dragons. When Hermit is surprised to see her ships possess anti-Dragon Ether, the commander states that as one of the Oración Seis Interstellar, she considers the possibility that they would fight God Acnoella. After learning that Hermit plans to create her own brand of anti-Dragon Ether, she tells her that it took years for the Interstellar Union Army to develop it. But Holy is shocked when Hermit succeeded shortly and immediately shared the anti-Dragon Ether with the forces of Shiki and Elsie. She internally notes that the Crew of Edens are formidable to grow at such terrific speed. Holy then learns that the Edens Zero has its own

   When Hermit and Sister intend to go through the plan to take down Crow, Holy coldly remarks that they made it sound so easy. She replies to the Mind of Edens that she has the training to pilot a Knight Gear and questions if she's willing to let her use Edens Zero's Knight Gear. The commander is surprised when Hermit reveals that she also researched about her past too as well and advises her to fight alongside them. Holy thanks Hermit for willing to help her.

   Upon seeing Crow confronting the Edens Zero through the visual screen, Holy darkly smiles with anticipation.
   Piloting the Steel Sorceress 94, Holy comments on the female battle suit's exposed chest area that she is currently wearing before launching into battle against Crow.
