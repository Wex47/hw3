   Kurenai is a curvy woman of average height, she has dark blue hair in a courtesan hairstyle, but with her forelocks parted over her right eye. She wears a rather sultry, red kimono with a splotch pattern, a brown belt with gold arrows pointing in opposite directions, a butterfly-styled choker, and a white silk scarf that floats around her in the shape of a heart. To the right of her head, she wears two flowers, one red and one white, with gold ornaments while on her left are three gold beads. Additionally, she has a pair of gauntlets and goes around barefoot.

   Despite claiming that she had a soft spot for her own people by protecting them from evil criminals in which she resented, it was all a veneer that she made as Kurenai is at best, described as a rather sadistic woman who loves to hurt her enemies or people she doesn't like. This was shown as she burnt the face of a young attractive man that she doesn't like because he was too inferior for her own tastes and make him as her own personal pet.
  </p>
  <p key="c4234fd7-dafe-4439-b51f-216ff0cb66c6">
   She is also a callous woman who uses the people of the labor district as her own slaves in order to enjoy her own personal lavish life and once she sights an interesting object that has caught her attention because it could make more rewards for her, she showed no hesitation to discard the people that had helped her rise to the top. This was shown as when she took an interest in the Edens Zero because it could make a fortune, she showed no hesitation to obliterate the labor district because the people who live there had no use for her anymore.

   Despite all of this however, Kurenai used to be a poor woman strangled in casino's debt and also a former slave herself due to the extreme gambling that she had in which she is seemingly had a remorse on. However, as soon as

  <p key="c0f92531-8c5d-43f9-b909-91cea029c834">
   Kurenai is perfectly fine on abandoning her own biological daughter, Homura, just to pursue her own ambitions and when Homura rejects the fake forgiveness Kurenai had made just to save her own skin when being defeated by Shiki and her own companions, she then dismissed her as a simple-minded person.

   at some point before leaving, Kurenai gifted Homura with a stuffed animal, which Homura interpreted as a means for Kurenai to recognize her in case she returned.

   Although she appeared to be moved to tears by Valkyrie's kindness, Kurenai did not fulfill her promise; over the next two years, Kurenai became Mordo's wife and then killed him, taking his place as ruler of Sun Jewel. Dubbing herself "Madame Kurenai" and completely losing interest in Homura, she sought to further increase her wealth by provoking a nest of Stones into stampeding through the Labor District so the workers could send their metals to her as they fought in self-defense; this act unwittingly resulted in the death of Valkyrie, who sacrificed herself to slay the entire horde and protect the workers.

   —christened by her as the "Oculus Kurenai"—to inflict punishment on those who threatened the security of Sun Jewel, executing criminals for serious offenses such as robbery, and sentencing others to the labor district for petty crimes so they could spend their lives providing money for her. Kurenai's dominion garnered conflicting opinions for her among the planet's populace: to the citizens of the Rich Sector who directly benefited from her rule, she became a beloved icon whom they credited for turning Sun Jewel into the "safest planet in the Sakura Cosmos";
   to those she sentenced to the Labor District, however, she was despised and seen for her tyrannical ways, resulting in the birth of a resistance movement known as

Cedric affectionately touches her face, offering to keep her warm on lonely nights. She is asked by Ward if she approves of him, only for her to state that she disapproves. She calls Cedric vulgar for touching her face without her consent and believes that he mistook her for a sensualist. She then grabs his face, saying that she does not like him, and gleefully burns his face, turning it deep red. After he collapses, she asks Ward for the next candidate, only to be informed he was the last one. She then orders him to find more, expecting a better selection.

   She is ecstatic as she crushes Shiki with her Knight Gear's fist. She tells him that his Ether Gear doesn't work is because of the Ether coating. Though she is surprised that he used his powers to make the ground heavier, sending them to the Labor District, much to her disgust. She is taken off guard when Shiki slams her Kurenai Dragoon down, finding that he damaged the boosters. She gets it to turn over, as Shiki says that he's gonna make sure to take her to Homura. She questions what he's expecting, a touching reunion or her daughter taking out her rage on her. When she hears that he's doing it for Valkyrie, Kurenai finds it stupid and throws punches at him. She goes on about how kids are ruining the world with their ideals and delusions and that they should face reality. However, Shiki counters that the adults that do aren't making things better and punches her Knight Gear. Kurenai is surprised that he managed to damage it and realizes that he deactivated his Ether Gear just before he hit.
