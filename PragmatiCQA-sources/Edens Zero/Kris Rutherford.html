In the year X482, sometime after Müller's escape, the family was visited by him, where he killed his parents and kidnapped him and Kleene to use as guinea pigs for his O-Tech experiments. He was strapped onto a cross, warning the mad scientist in vain to not hurt Kleene, just as Müller is about to dismember him while forcing his sister to watch as an experiment to see how long before her emotions break down entirely.
   Because of the mad scientist's experiments, he became an O-Tech himself with mechanics making up 60% of his body structure.

He firmly states to the Crew of Edens that they will leave the ship as soon as his sister is healed. He then ignores a dejected Shiki and leaves the Briefing Room with Kleene and Laguna.
   At the Edens Kitchen, Jinn converses with Laguna and Kleene at the dining table while eating. The former Rogue Out mercenary states that he never thought of seeing him again in this reunion. He comments on Laguna leaving the showbiz to commit acts of evil and not even used a codename like him and Kleene. He immediately defends his sister that she did nothing wrong after the actor retorts back at him that Drakken's "business" is evil and his sister was a part of it too. Jinn informs Laguna that

When Sister suggests asking his sister about the cause behind it, Jinn grabs Sister by the collar and lividly tells her that the one thing he will never let her do is asking Kleene what happened in the past. Jinn then lets go of an irate Life of Edens, turning around with his arms folded as he explains that if his sister ever remembers her past, not even the electronic hairclip device can contain her feelings. He pleads to Sister to not ask Kleene.

   During an aerial dogfight with the attack drones, Jinn boarded one of the starfighters from the unlocked hanger and shot down multiple attack drones with ease as he questions about their opponents.
   Jinn is warned by Kleene that the enemy is approaching at 3 o'clock which he noted and activates the objective visor. He takes down more attack drones in the sky while commenting that he can't believe he is doing work for no pay.

   Jinn in his starfighter continues shooting down a lot of Foresta's drones, noting that they just keep coming. After being informed about the giant satellite server behind the machine virus, Jinn is requested by Witch to back up Weiz and Hermit, who are on their way to dispatch it. He complies, stating that is what a mercenary is for.
   During the orbital battle near the server, Jinn advises his sister to go back to the Edens Zero and rest if she is tired after overhearing from Laguna that her starfighter is moving slow.
   He contacts Sister that Kleene is acting strange and that they are heading back to the Edens Zero.
   After landing their starfighters at the Edens Zero's hanger, Jinn asks a mentally unstable Kleene what is wrong. Desperately, he kneels on the floor and pleads with the Life of Edens to help his sister, even offering her to use any part of his organic body that is left.
   At the Medical Room of Edens Zero, an impassive Jinn sits on one of the benches near the doorway while Sister and Witch attend to his sister's condition.
   As Jinn waits for any news, Weisz informs him that he met Müller and was told of their past. Shocked upon hearing the mad scientist's name, he deduces that he is why Kleene is in pain right now and demands where he is so he can deal with him personally. When Weisz notifies him that his group took care of him, he is left speechless. Suddenly, Sister comes out of the Medical Room which Jinn quickly asks how Kleene is doing and is told to check for himself. He rushes in and is astonished to see his sister smiling. After Kleene states that he fulfilled his promise of finding Sister and curing her, Jinn tearfully smiles and is glad his sister has finally recovered.

   Tied up in a ball of rope and hanging in the air, Jinn expresses in an unimpressed manner that this training serves no purpose for him as he casually uses his rocket arms to free himself easily. He smirks at an annoyed Xenolith who sees it as cheating. Jinn tells Kleene that he will untie her now but is easily moved by her determination to train. However, the O-Tech mercenary gets upset when Xenolith throws a block on his sister's face that interrupted the mood, threatening the short machine that he is a dead man.
   Jinn tells Weisz to stay away from his sister, calling him a pervert for being tied up in a compromising position.
   After exiting the VR Training Facility, the O-Tech mercenary yells at Laguna to stop flirting with Kleene. He stands silently as Xenolith tells the Crew of Edens that they can find a Relic in the form of bottle caps all over the place on Foresta.

   ): Using the rudimentary grasp of this technique
   causes the Ether lines on Jinn' body to become three-dimensional and swirl in the air around him like the wind.
   During his fight with Callum, Jinn enters his real Overdrive state. His clothes change into a dark-colored, high-collared shirt which lacks sleeves and exposes the sides of his torso, it is connected to a pair of matching black trousers that are tucked into a pair of light-colored boots, and wears a dark, armored mask that covers his entire face. Additionally, he gains a pair of  large, dark-colored feathered wings. Ether lines appear on his forearms, where right forearm gains a dark mark resembling a flame. In this form, his wind are greatly augmented to the point where he can strike an opponent with enough wind power and speed to completely slash through them.
