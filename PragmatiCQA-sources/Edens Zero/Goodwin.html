   Goodwin is a confident being who proclaims that he will be the man who takes down the Emperor.
   Though, Goodwin does show his fanboy side, fawning over Rebecca and Happy when he meets the owners of Aoneko Channel, excitedly stating that he is their huge fan who donates his money to them under the alias of OA_NEKO. He is even more than happy to do anything for Rebecca. Despite this, Goodwin can be serious when he wants to be, as he does not take Laguna's abandonment of Oasis' cause and failure to abide by their rules lightly
   , and bluntly stating that he does not need help from outsiders.

When Ibaraki calls him out for misappropriating their organization's funds just to give handouts to Rebecca, Goodwin bluntly retorts that he uses his own money and tells the hotheaded member to quit whining. However, the Oasis rebel leader is reminded about Laguna by Ibaraki and glares at the actor before him. Goodwin notes Laguna as the miserable coward who abandoned the cause and he did not think he would see his face again. Goodwin glares again at Laguna who tells him that the Crew of Edens needs help from Oasis but immediately changes his tune when Rebecca begs him to let him hear what they have to say, stating enthusiastically that he will do anything for her. Resuming his glare, he declares that they can deal with Laguna and his failure to abide by their rules later.

Goodwin explains to the Crew of Edens that there is an ocean spread across the Aoi Cosmos where once every few years, the ocean hits its high tide and swallows up every planet in the cosmos. He explains that inside the great sea, Ether and electricity combine, and all networks become connected. Raising up 3 fingers, Goodwin tells Shiki and his friends that the Aoi High Tide hits in 3 days and if they don't stop Shura before then, all of the bots will be wiped out of the Aoi Cosmos. Contemplating after Laguna pointed out that Shiki uses the same power as the Emperor's son, Goodwin frowns and bluntly states that Oasis doesn't need help from outsiders. Suddenly,

However, he becomes serious again when one of his subordinates informs him that there are enemy reinforcements on the west side. Goodwin is surprised to know from

When one brave Imperial soldier points out that they have lost comrades too and Oasis is not the only one, Goodwin squats down on the ground and tells the soldier that he's right, surprising the scared prisoners. He tells the Imperial soldiers that there are no good guys or bad guys in war as it is just two sides raising the death count while they refuse to give in. The giant cat states that the Oasis can't stop as long as the Nero Empire keeps extending its grasp. Goodwin explains that every time it does, millions or tens of millions of lives are lost along with their freedom, and once they take over, the innocents suffer from heavy taxes, oppression, and censorship as they plunder the Aoi Sea like they own it. The Oasis rebel leader roared that he hates the Nero Empire, scaring the frightened Imperial troops of his wrath. However, Goodwin declares to the stunned prisoners that while he hates the Nero Empire, he does not hate them and proclaims that when the war is over, they can hang out with Oasis for drinks or something and watch B-Cube concerts together.
