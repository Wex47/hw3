   As an O-Tech, Müller is a tall, lean cyborg with a grotesque appearance, he has tridactyl feet, three tendrils instead of a hand on his right arm. He retains his human head, losing most of his hair, with only a few strands of long hair and a bushy mustache. His eyes also retain the rings from before. On his back is the kanji for "Genius".
   After the rest of his cyborg body is destroyed, Müller uses short appendages from his cybernetic ears to act as limbs.

   However, in reality, he and his coworkers all look down on machines. He sees them as nothing but junk and happily destroying or abusing them, not hesitating to state how humans are superior to machines and freely admitting that he can't stand them. As soon as Hook was destroyed, Müller revealed his true colors, ordering his coworkers to dispose of Hermit, calling her "garbage," only to spare her at the suggestion of his subordinate to keep her around for inhumane experiments.
   After two years of abusing Hermit for his own amusement, Müller's sanity has degraded from his continuous abuse of Hermit to the point even his own coworkers gave up on him. He takes sadistic joy in beating her and seeing her as his property, the latter shown during his arrest, demanding the Cosmic Government soldiers to keep their hands off her.
   He also takes joy in hearing the screams of the children he tortures.

   After gaining his own O-Tech body, Müller came to appreciate machines in his own twisted way and felt powerful in his new form, having previously mocked mechanical humans.
   He also switches his views, now calling humans inferior. Müller is also cowardly, as after losing his body, he begs Hermit to save him,
   trying to appease her through their old friendship and stops himself from giving his insults to no avail.

  <p key="90902a4f-14ce-4b7c-9dc6-afdae4eebf4a">
   In the year X477, Müller met Hermit who wanted to be friends with humans. He asked her to help his group in making the
   <a href="Ether Accelerator Prototype Number 6.html" key="cc889ae9-65dc-4975-b27a-76b2621c21a6" title="Ether Accelerator Prototype Number 6">

   </a>
   , to which she accepted.
   He showed Hermit their sixth prototype of the Ether Accelerator and told the android that they could save the bots of Hook if it was complete, but their technology can't stabilize the Ether fusion reactor. Müller then showed her Hook and informed her that it is a planet of discarded robots and has an Ether deficiency. He is asked by Hermit why he is eager to help the bots, to which he responded that humans and bots need each other and that he believes friendship between the two can exist. He then stopped himself from giving subjective thoughts, but Hermit agreed with his belief and requested to help him in his research.
   . He allowed Hermit to help, who was surprised by his policy of humans working with bots. He later re-assigned all the bot researchers, sans Hermit, to work on-site on Hook. On the day of Operation C7, Müller and his researchers began preparations to fire the Ether Accelerator. He alleviated Hermit of her worries and claimed that they are already friends. He then ordered his team to begin and fired at planet Hook. Müller stayed silent as emergency messages from the bot researchers came to them pleading to shut the Accelerator off.
  </p>
  <p key="7940ca20-997b-4c0a-9403-319494d855d0">
   After Hook is destroyed Müller and his fellow scientists revealed their true colors and cheered for the success of their operation. He mocked her for not figuring out that she was building a weapon and that he tricked her into helping him. He revealed that it was to rid both Hook and the lab of robots, dubbed Operation Cleaner and that he needed her in the lab if something went wrong. He then claimed humans are superior and declared to wipe the cosmos of all living bots. Müller is grossed by Hermit's crying and demanded the others to kill her. However, one scientist convinced him otherwise and suggested using her as an experiment for an Ether Separator.
   Two years passed, Müller is annoyed that Hermit can't give more output and does not care if he loses another bot. However, his colleague informed him that Hermit is their last one and is ready to fall apart, making him criticized his colleague for sympathizing with the bot. He then faced Hermit and order her to smile, praising her before throwing a barrage and told her to smile bigger. His colleagues noted how hopeless it is for the android and Müller. Later, his lab is raided by the

   He was taken to an Interstellar Union Army jail, until he caused an explosion where he escaped during the chaos, losing some body parts in the process and turned himself into an O-Tech.
   The Rutherford Family, who were patrons of his, found out about his arrest and research and withdrew their financial support. After his escape, Müller visited the family, killed the parents and kidnapped the children, using them as guinea pigs. He forced

   and with a sickening laugh, asks her if she would like to continue the experiment much to Hermit's shock and horror.
   Still giggling mad, Müller expresses his twisted joy of meeting Hermit again. He explains to the android who thought he was in jail of his escape, ranting that it was wrong to lock him up in the first place, believing it was all a conspiracy and someone was jealous of his work as he proclaims his hate for them. He also notes his cyborg modifications, commenting on how he used to make fun of mechanical humans but now admits how great it is to be one. Müller denies Hermit's accusation of being responsible for making the bots of Foresta go berserk and reveals it was actually Ziggy's doing. He explains that the Demon King just put him in charge of managing the server in orbit and allows him to use all the humans of the Verdant Planet as his test subjects as a reward. Smiling menacingly, the insane scientist also states he will get to experiment on Hermit again. Using his cyborg abilities that tap into a holographic terminal, Müller takes out Weisz by electrocuting him from the floor, telling him to stay out of the way. He then restrains Hermit's arms and legs, gleefully telling her that it's time to continue the experiment he started long ago and that her mechanical body is the best of the best for he will never forget those days, reawakening Hermit's past trauma as a result.

   Holding Hermit at his mercy, Müller gleefully explains that he will begin the experiment by testing the speed of an android's pain receptors in reaction to Ether fission. The mad scientist noticing Hermit's fearful expression, demanding her to smile for him just like before. Overhearing Weisz trying to get up, Müller informs the young man that his pulse paralyzed his nerves and that he will not be able to move for some time. Taking a good look at Weisz's face, Müller thinks that he had seen him somewhere before and remembers Hermit calling out the young man's name in concern earlier. He realizes in shock that the paralyzed person on the ground is the Robotics Genius,

   Probing Weisz's head with his tendrils, Müller finds it intriguing that the brain of the young man will be the brain of a genius one day. The mad scientist is suddenly caught off guard by Weisz equipping his

   and the young man kneed him in the chin. Angered, Müller overhears their plan to modify the satellite server and save the bots of Foresta, stating that he will not let them and there will be no mercy from him for their defiance. Müller pulls the lever that controls the server and explains to a shocked Hermit that he gave the machines orders to be more fierce and violent. He gloats that Foresta is finished and the machines will destroy humanity.

   Müller is punched in the face by Weisz but is able to regain balance and footing on the floor with ease, giggling mad. He brags to the young man that his suit's firepower does not affect him. Müller explains to Hermit that after escaping from prison, he started experimenting on O-Tech with the intent to turn himself into a superior O-Tech being at the expense of many human guinea pigs he needed, angering Weisz. When a disgusted Hermit asks why would he do something cruel, the psychopathic scientist retorts that they should be honored for their contribution to creating "the ultimate O-Tech". He reveals to the two that his best work was on the Rutherford siblings as he made the sister watch while he was dismantling her brother's body in front of her. Smiling with sickening glee, Müller comments that their screams of pain, terror, and agony was the greatest show in the Cosmos to him.
   After revealing this, Müller is surprised to learn that Weisz and Hermit know about the Rutherford siblings. With a twisted sneer, he asks how is Jinn doing before retracting the question, knowing that his guinea pig was doing splendidly. Müller answers Hermit's question of how he knows the Rutherford siblings, where their family were patrons of the Müller Royal Laboratories. The mad scientist rants that when he was arrested, the Rutherfords withdrew their financial support after they learned the contents of his research. Müller retorts to the Mind of Edens that she knows nothing as he delusionally claimed that his research could have saved countless human lives. He explains to the two that after he escaped from prison, he paid the Rutherford family a visit for revenge, gloating that he killed the parents and kidnapped their children to use as his new guinea pigs. Müller is struck by an enraged Weisz, injured and shocked at the young man's power before being bombarded by the young man's

   . Angered and annoyed, the insane scientist calms himself down and that he has better functionality than his opponent does. Using the cooling ears at full power, Müller regains composure and claims to be thinking clearly now. He decides to recreate the experiment on the Rutherford siblings with the intent to dismantle Weisz and to see Hermit break but then mocks that he forgot that machines do not have emotions before getting an immediate punch to the face by a livid Weisz who tells him to not open his mouth again. Lying on the floor, Müller brags that it is too late as he reveals that he activated the final protocol that will destroy Foresta and kill everyone on the planet; the

When Hermit sternly asks him how many of his victims begged him for their lives, the mad scientist claims that this was different. After she pointed out that he hurt Jinn and Kleene, Müller protests that he didn't kill the Rutherford siblings, stoically surprising Laguna.
   Müller begs Hermit to spare his life, claiming that he is a changed man and knows that machines have feelings now. He states that it is the reason why he went along with Ziggy's plans. Müller points out that humans are trash and pleads with her to help him. After the Mind of Edens sees through his attempt and calls him out on it, a nervous Müller attempts to flatter her and tells her to think about their past friendship with false tears, annoying Weisz. He is relieved when Hermit picks his head up only to be tricked into opening his eyes for a retina scan that is needed for the last encryption. Müller tries to save face that he is glad to be able to be of service but is confused when Hermit states that because of their friendship, she has something to say to him. He is then thrown in the air and punched in the face by Hermit who tells him to never get near her again, sending him flying. Crashing in the wall, Müller is knocked unconscious.
