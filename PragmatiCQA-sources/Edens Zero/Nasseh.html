   Nasseh is a tall, slim young man with droopy eyes, short, light-colored hair cut to a bob, and a dark-colored emblem on the base of his forehead that resembles an open eye. His main attire is a dark-colored bodysuit that slightly exposes his chest and has light-colored lines going down the sleeves similar to ether lines.

   Approaching the three bots who are trying to reach out to Rebecca and Weisz, Nasseh tells them to not waste their breath and explains that only he knows how to undo the hypnosis. He confirms to Happy that it is his Ether Gear and describes the Eye of Horus as "the power of hypnosis". When Mosco confronts him and claimed to have found a massive weakness, Nasseh finds it interesting. He stands silent as Mosco claims that his hypnosis has no effect on androids and assumed a sumo wrestling stance after taking off his wig and clothes. Nasseh notes that Mosco is talking about sumo ranks and asks the large bot if his Yokozuna is good which his opponent confirms that it is the highest rank and charges at him with a Galactic Yokozuna Style: Meteor Face Slap Shower. Nasseh then swiftly kicks Mosco in the face and tells the latter that he has the wrong idea, explaining that his hypnosis does work on androids although it takes a little more time to kick in. As a demonstration, Nasseh hypnotizes Mosco into believing that he is a fine lady, shocking Happy and Pino of the results. Noticing the other two androids, the Oceans member calls them adorable as he is glad that he saved them for last, and wonders what he will do with them. He is briefly surprised by Happy transforming into
   <a href="Happy Blasters.html" key="d534930c-cdaa-404b-b6cd-47ca91a6480d" title="Happy Blasters">

   </a>
   and swiftly dodges the barrage of Ether bullets to the right side. Then Nasseh is affected by Pino's

   that freed Rebecca, Weisz, and Mosco from his hypnosis, upsetting him. He realizes that Pino is the biggest threat all along as he stands guard for potential retaliation from his enemies. Nasseh smirks that his Ether is back after it quickly returned and targets Pino with Hypno Connect, affecting her. He hypnotizes Pino into believing that she is a mole before doing the same to Happy and then Mosco again where they are hypnotized into believing that they are a pigeon and a party girl respectively. The Oceans member laughs at the three hypnotized robots as he finds it hilarious. Smirking maliciously at an unnerved Rebecca and Weisz, Nasseh tells the two that it is time for "fatal hypnosis".
  </p>
  <p key="e663a42a-6dc6-4033-aee1-ee4830cc7019">
   After his declaration, Nasseh states that he has a suggestion that will guide the two to their deaths. He hypnotizes Rebecca and Weisz into choking themselves with their hands, telling them to die. The Oceans member smiles as he watches his victims suffer. However, Nasseh is surprised when Lyra shows up to stop him and he is confused after she requested him to let her have Rebecca. He notes that Lyra stated that her show is about to begin in a middle of a war. He is stunned after the female Oceans member gave her reasons but concedes, snapping Rebecca out from choking herself. Nasseh then hypnotizes the

   into thinking that she is a loyal dog to Lyra, telling her to do everything his comrade tells her. He shrugs with a remark about the things he does for Lyra when the latter and Rebecca leaves. After Lyra states that they need to have fun, the Oceans member notes that his fun is almost over upon noticing Weisz still choking on the floor. However, Nasseh is shocked when Weisz is covered in
   <a href="Arsenal Suit.html" key="03bcb3ee-ce98-4666-82f9-f27fae80bee3" title="Arsenal Suit">

   </a>
   and demanded answers from him. He listens when Weisz deduces that his hypnosis is really just electrical signals and the fact it worked on the bots tipped him off, revealing that he forcibly reconfigures another person's Ether. Nasseh accepts Weisz's logic but asks how he is acting like his normal self, which the latter states that it's not hard to block the electrical signals with the Arsenal Suit Mark II as an example. The Oceans member reminds the man that he was under his hypnosis the whole time but learns that Weisz has a timer function set to equip his suit automatically, preventing him from using hypnotic suggestions again. Nasseh answers Weisz's question of Rebecca's whereabouts with a lie that he took her away while the latter was under his hypnosis. Opening the hatch from the ceiling, he finds Weisz's mechanical suit interesting and states that he needs to have his fun as he is encased within a large mechanical suit of his own. Piloting it, Nasseh remarks to a surprised Weisz that he is a big fan of mechas before charging at the latter, grabbing him and throwing him out from the underground hallway into the skies of the domed city. Presenting to his opponent the Nero Empire's latest model of mechanical suits, Nasseh boasts the power of the Sea Devil.

  <p key="871af19a-5aff-45a3-949c-1b76c02e673f">
   Battling Weisz, Nasseh fires a spray of Ether bullets from the Sea Devil's left forearm at his enemy who dodges them. He remarks excitedly that this is fun while continuing the attack before firing a barrage of missiles from his mechanical suit's right forearm at Weisz. Pursuing Weisz and easily shrugging off his attack with the Sea Devil's Ether coating, the Oceans member reminds him about his Knight Gear being the Nero Empire's latest model. Raising his suit's left hand, Nasseh creates a volley of Ether bullets in the air before directing towards Weisz. Laughing at his opponent dodging the barrage, he comments that it is just like a "shoot-them-up game". Although, Nasseh notes that kids don't know the term nowadays and explains to Weisz that it is a video game subgenre as when kids talk about shooting games, they mean "first or third person shooters". He states that back in the old days, a shooting game meant that they dodge barrages of enemy fire, confusing Weisz. After the Sea Devil easily shrugs off Weisz's attacks, Nasseh tells him that his Ether bullets aren't going to work. When Weisz charges at him and touches the Sea Devil up close, the Oceans member is not impressed that his opponent decided to go for hand-to-hand combat against him. But Nasseh is then caught off guard when his mechanical suit is affected by Weisz's Ether Gear, realizing that he is remodeling the Sea Devil. He screams in shock after the Sea Devil is heavily damaged by Weisz's

   has the power to reconfigure machines, an irritated Nasseh calls Weisz's Ether Gear cheating and that it is not fair. However, he declares with a smirk that he is going to win. Upon noticing Arsenal Mark II's mask being broken to pieces, the Oceans member recalls that Weisz's suit protects him from his hypnosis and attempts to use the Eye of Horus to hypnotize Weisz again. But Nasseh is surprised that his Ether Gear is not working and wonders why he can't use his hypnotic power, which Weisz reveals that he setted up several signal jammers all over town by remodeling them. He is defeated by Weisz's

Getting up to start running away from his opponent, calling it a tactical retreat. While fleeing into an alleyway, Nasseh contacts his fellow Oceans members through the Oceans Group Chat on his phone to text and inform them of the bad situation that he is in. After Lyra replies that her show is starting and apologizes, he texts back that their enemies can use Overdrive which
