   She was betrothed to James Holloway at a young age, who was a prince from another kingdom on her planet, where their union was a means to unite both kingdoms. During their time together, Elsie proposed to James that they should kiss, flustering the young prince. He retorts how that their parents decided for them to get married so her kingdom could absorb his, but Elsie prepares for the kiss anyway. Blushing he nervously tries but is stopped by the young princess, saying that they should wait until they are older, flustering him more.
   Later on, she learns about her kingdom's obsession of weapon development, that eventually became a threat to the rest of the Kaede Cosmos. Wanting to stop her parent's brutality, she gave away her kingdom's secrets to others, but this resulted in war.

   , Elsie learns that Ziggy must have come to the Aoi Cosmos and may have gone to see Poseidon Nero which she hoped she was wrong. She tells her crew member that they are both kings to either pay each other respect or destroy each other. Elsie cheerfully states she would rather not deal with Poseidon Nero and tells her crew to find a good planet with good food and stay there for a while. However, the Armored Space Pirate has been informed by her crew that the Interstellar Union Army fleet appeared and gave pursuit to the Skull Fairy which she mutters Justice's name in annoyance. She orders Jesse next to her to get rid of them much to the man's confusion before telling him to drop the act now and accused him of bringing Justice and his forces here, perplexing the crew who thought she was a little harsh for her usual teasing. Turning to Jesse, Elsie asks him if he really thought she did not notice and reveals to the crew that Jesse is a government spy, shocking them. Elsie tells Jesse that this is his last chance to rid of them and in exchange, she will hear him out if he does. When a compromised Jesse did not respond amidst his shaking body with cold sweat, the Armored Space Pirate is disappointed and orders her crew to send him back to Justice's ship.

After Jesse lividly declares that she will never beat the Interstellar Union Army, Elsie is further disappointed and had him placed inside the space pod to be ejected back to Justice and his pursuing forces. When Gowen and Hyoga declared they needed to do better background checks for every new crew member from now on and prevent another attempt of infiltration into the Skull Fairy, Elsie insists that she will continue to welcome them regardless and believes that their time together creates bonds between them and builds a family when they live life on a ship, reminiscing her childhood past at the Edens Zero with the Four Shining Stars who took her in. With the two Princess Guard members simply conceded by their leader's words, the Armored Space Pirate orders her crew to set course for

Sighing at their hostility, she comments that no one is happy to see pirates, though she agrees with Hyoga's statement, where she states that there is something wrong on this planet that forced the machines to attack humans whether they want to or not.

   , saving his life. She apologizes to Shiki, stating that it is her fault, and reassures the young man that her crew will get Homura back from Interstellar Union Army custody. Enraged, Elsie declares that she will make Justice pay for hurting Shiki.
   Confronting Justice, Elsie changes her outfit into a high collared battle gear and her Antares into a katana with Star Drain. She states that she is done playing games with Justice and tells him to begone this instant. Elsie clashes her weapon with Justice's own katana, causing a massive shockwave of Ether that is seen across Foresta.
   Elsie and Justice clash their swords against each other, causing shockwaves that destroy the surrounding area around them. She notes that Justice had gotten better in their fight, calling him by his original name James Holloway. After being called a traitor to their fatherland, she claims that the nation had no meaning, angering Justice who reveals that he lost everything because of her treachery. Elsie is tackled by Justice, taking both of them several meters away into an abandoned city in Foresta. She is sent flying into the wall of a building by Justice's strike and dodges out of the way as the soldier tries to kick her.

   They continue their sword fight in the air. She expresses how she lost everything too, but the Interstellar member retorts back that if she had not betrayed them, they would not have lost everything. She disputes with Justice's accusation of her betrayal that someone had to do something or they would have lost the entire Kaede Cosmos. Elsie's strike shatters the entire building which Justice jumps out of the way, calling her logic twisted. She retorts to the soldier that if there was any real justice, he would have seen it. While battling in the air, Elsie tells Justice that he would have seen how the government was and what they were plotting. After hearing the soldier's intentions to change the government, the space pirate explains that they were too young to have that kind of power and there was not enough time. Because of that reason, she told everyone the truth about the government which Justice points out that she ended up starting a war as a result. Engaged in a close-range grappling hold against each other, the Galáctica member defends that it was the only way to right what was wrong and mocks the soldier for his obsession over false justice, knowing that he would not understand. Elsie asks Justice if he remembers the last time their faces were this close to each other in the past as children.
   After both have stopped their respective Meteors, she teasingly proposes to Justice that they should finish what they have started and wonders if their kiss will engender forgiveness in their hearts. However, Elsie is surprised to see Justice moving close to her for a kiss and calls him a brave man. Upon their first kiss, the two simultaneously stabs each other in the abdomen with their katanas much to their surprise. Staggering from her wound, the space pirate finds their first kiss wonderful and memorable and agrees with Justice that it seems that this is their fate.

   Resuming their fight, Elsie and Justice call out each other's names before punching each other in the face that causes a huge shockwave. Suddenly, a group of Foresta drones ambushed the two after detecting their powerful Ether. The Armored Space Pirate dodges out of the way from the machines' bombardment and swiftly eliminating them before clashing with Justice once more. In mid-air, Elsie and Justice simultaneously unleash Grand Chariot against each other, causing massive destruction.
   Grievously injured and exhausted, Elsie notes that the

   After returning to the Skull Fairy, Elsie is covered in bandages over her wounds and contacts the Crew of Edens which she is relieved that they all made it back to their respective ships. She reassures a concerned Shiki and his friends that the Skull Fairy is equipped with the latest in medical technology and asks about their injuries which Rebecca replies that they have Sister to heal them for it. The Armored Space Pirate tells a grateful Homura to thank Gowen and Hyoga for saving her from the Interstellar Union Army's custody. Sitting on her throne, Elsie answers Happy's question that the Oración Seis Interstellar is indeed a big deal and explains to the Crew of Edens that each six of them are in a class of their own even within the Cosmic Government and their power supposedly even rivals even that of the Oración Seis Galáctica. She apologizes to Shiki and his friends that Justice singled them out as enemies because of their association with her and tells the young man to be careful from now on. Elsie states that she and her crew will continue the pursuit of Ziggy after confirming that the Demon King did come to the Aoi Cosmos. Ending communications with the Crew of Edens, she says that they will meet again.
   Elsie with a solemn look continues her search in the Aoi Cosmos to find Ziggy and defeat him.

Elsie backflips to kick Ziggy but is brought down to the ground by his gravity before evading the dislodged pillars being used as projectiles. But she fails to dodge the last one and got pushed back. Regaining on her feet, Elsie blitzes toward Ziggy and slashed through him with her weapon but suffered damage in turn. When Ziggy asks if Shiki is now equal to her in power as well, Elsie replies that while she haven't sparred with him, she states that he was almost at her level some months ago and showed her just how strong a person can become when their desire is to protect. The space pirate captain remarked that Shiki meant so much to Ziggy before and cannot believe that he changed into a villain. She is confused when the Demon King expresses regret of raising Shiki whom he deemed as a threat to the cosmoses.
