Lyra tells Nasseh that he can do whatever he wants with Rebecca's friends, stating that she only wants the girl. After Nasseh stops Rebecca from choking herself and then hypnotizes her into a loyal dog, Lyra reassures that she will wake the

Although, Lyra admires Rebecca's legs to be beautiful upon looking at them.

She whispers to a confused Rebecca that she is the guest of her show since the B-Cuber was unconscious at the time. She introduces her name and her affiliation with the Nero Empire upon answering Rebecca's question. Lyra explains to Rebecca that they are going to fight here and they might as well make a spectacle out of it. When Rebecca questions why she is in a new outfit, Lyra tells her that she has to look good for the camera and that they are broadcasting this for the world. Preparing her set of cards on her left hand, Lyra states that this is the game they will be playing: "Lost Card" while winking at Rebecca.

   When Nasseh texted his fellow Oceans members in the Oceans Group Chat about the bad situation he is in, Lyra replies in her text that her show is starting and apologizes. At the venue, she confirms to Rebecca that they are going to have a card game in front of the people watching them. However, Lyra adds that it is not just a card game and explains that in "Lost Card", every time they lose, a piece of clothing gets "lost" as she briefly lowers her jacket down in a teasing manner much to Rebecca's shock and the audience's delight. When the B-Cuber refuses to participate in her game, she states that she has no choice and reveals that there is a bomb in a form of a fish-shaped bow tie around her neck. Lyra casually remarks that if Rebecca doesn't want to play, then it will be her fault the show ends with a literal bang.
   After Rebecca boldly accepts her challenge, Lyra is pleased and comments that the B-Cuber is that gutsy. She confirms Rebecca's question that she too will lose if she loses her clothes and explains that the rules will have to be fair for both of them, further delighting the audience. Although, Lyra with a smirk states that there is one more thing she forgot to tell Rebecca and sadistically reveals that after the loser has been stripped totally naked in front of everyone, a part of their body will be lost too, terrifying her.

When Shiki is about to drag Rebecca away, Lyra simply points out the bomb around the B-Cuber's neck that is about to set off, forcing Rebecca to stop Shiki. She then explains to Shiki that as long as the bomb is around Rebecca's neck, the B-Cuber's only choice is to obey her. Lyra is relieved to see that Callum made it in time to deal with Shiki and remove him away from the venue. She declares that it is time to start their game, calling Rebecca a kitten despite the latter pointing out that she is wearing a bunny girl outfit.

  <p key="e01aac66-6cba-4b63-b953-fcdbce8c50e4">
   In a live broadcast, Lyra with a wink declares to everyone watching her channel that it's time to start the show. After the small floating round table is formed, she explains to Rebecca that the rules of Lost Card are very simple as each of them gets five cards numbered 1 through 5 as she shows them. Lyra states that they set the cards face down the table and turn the table which they pick a card at the same time. She states that whoever picks the card with the highest number wins. When Rebecca noted that it's too simple, Lyra tells her that simple is best after all and asks the B-Cuber if she is sure when she protests that there is no way to plan or strategize in Lost Card. Lyra and Rebecca start the game as they set their respective 5 cards down and turn the table. She is silent as the floating fish announcer tells them to pick their cards. When Rebecca pulls out a card with the number 1, Lyra states with a wink that she got a card with the number 5. Lyra tells a surprised Rebecca that it wasn't random for she knew the latter put her card exactly as she predicted. She cheers upon winning round one and notes that she will start with Rebecca's arm covers, declaring them to be "lost". Lyra wins round two after pulling out a card with number 5 again and states that Rebecca's stockings are "lost". In the next round, she is playfully disappointed that she got a card with the number 2 while Rebecca has a card with the number 4 this time. Conceding, she declares that her leggings are "lost" and reassures Rebecca that this is only a swimsuit, delighting the audience. Lyra loses another round after pulling out a card with the number 4 while Rebecca got a card with the number 5. She casually states that her jacket is now "lost" before winking at the camera and whispering to the viewers that they have to give the crowd what they wanted after all. Smirking, Lyra announces that from here on out, she means business. Lyra makes a comeback by winning two more rounds after pulling out cards with number 5 and declares that Rebecca's shoes and bunny ears headband are now "lost." She notes that the embarrassed B-Cuber is down to her leotard. After Rebecca uses her

   to go back to where she still has her bunny ears, Lyra is ready for round six with her. She cheers that she has the card with number 5 again and takes away the headband again, noting that now the B-Cuber is down to her leotard again. Darkly smirking, Lyra informs Rebecca that she has played this game over a hundred times and she only lost once. She reveals that the only person to ever beat her was her emperor, Poseidon Nero where she lost all of her clothes and then her left eye. Giggling sadistically, Lyra suggests to a horrified Rebecca that she will erase her legs after she strips her naked.

   Lyra stands confidently before an intimidated Rebecca
   as she wonders if the next round will be her opponent's last one before she bares it all.
   She notices Rebecca is copying her placement from the first round but she cheerfully gets another card with number 5. Pointing at her opponent victorious, she declares that Rebecca's leotard is now lost, taking it away. Lyra teasingly mocks Rebecca for being full frontal in front of the delighted audience. After Rebecca once again uses her Reverse to go back to where she still has her leotard, Lyra repeats her previous statement. Suddenly, she is surprised when her opponent suddenly collapses on the floor. Lyra assumes Rebecca is scared and states that she is not going to let her quit until only one of them becomes the winner. As round 7 begins, Lyra waits for the B-Cuber to get back on her feet and tells her to put her cards down. She is shocked of Rebecca's accusation for cheating. As the audience laughs, she remarks that previous opponents made such accusations every once in a while and challenges her opponent for proof. When Rebecca doesn't seem to have evidence of her claims, Lyra states that either she put her cards on the table or lose by default. After her opponent concedes and placed her cards, Lyra notes that she is copying her placement from the first round. Picking up the card, she shrugs that it doesn't matter anyway and states that she can just use her Ether Gear to change the card's number from 1 to 5. Noticing Rebecca not moving, Lyra tells her to show her the card from the table already. After hearing Rebecca knowing that her card will have number 1 while internally noting about her Ether Gear's power, Lyra reminds the B-Cuber that if she doesn't show the card she picked, they won't know who the winner will be. She shrugs with a sigh after Rebecca claimed to have confirm the cheating accusation against her as the audience booed at her opponent. Lyra is then shocked when Rebecca reveals that she has the card with number 5 hidden inside her cleavage. Caught and exposed, she wonders how did the B-Cuber pull it off and checks the cards in front of her to reveal the card with number 5 being torn in two. Lyra realizes in shock that Rebecca did this when she collapses on the floor earlier and questions Rebecca how she did know she would pick this card, unaware of her opponent's Reverse. Angry and embarrassed, Lyra tells the audience who booed at her for cheating to shut up and threw her flurry of cards at Rebecca who dodges. She declares the Lost Card game to be over and it is time for the slaughter show, which the audience is on her side again. Lyra is relieved to see Callum who is pushed back by Shiki. She throws her cards at Rebecca in attempt to stop her from leaving but the

   member to keep her eyes on her and throws Flame Card at her opponent which then exploded within the girl's wind. She laughs at Kleene suffering injuries from the explosion.
   Lyra throws more cards at Kleene who swiftly dodges with her wind. Brandishing more cards from her right hand, she explains that her Ether Gear specifically works on cards as it can change numbers and make them move. But then Lyra states that its real power is to change the cards' elements and demonstrated with Lightning Card that electrocutes Kleene in mid-air. Revealing her Ether Gear to be Gambler's Rush, the female Oceans member remarks that even she doesn't know what element her cards will be but that's what makes it so much fun for her.
   Lyra throws more cards at Kleene in bombardment but is shocked when her opponent's wind shreds all of her cards into pieces. She is defeated by
