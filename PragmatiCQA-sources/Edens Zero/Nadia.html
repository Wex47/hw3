   Nadia is a tall female android with seams running from her forehead across her eyes to her cheeks and around her neck, long flowing hair with the top tied with dark ribbons ending with heart ornaments, overall resembling a half-moon dumpling. She appears to be partially falling apart, with exposed wires around her neck and shoulders. She wears a loose dress with a feather-like pattern around her chest, overskirt, and detached sleeves. Her footwear consists of light-colored shoes with a single strap and small, dark dots. Additionally, she has a dark crescent moon-shaped crest behind her head and has guards on the sides of her face. She also carries around a long, thick cord that is connected to her back.
   This cord helps her function

   Nadia is a kind and polite individual, greeting visitors with a soft smile.
   She has a habit of reminding people that she is an old model.
   Nadia displays extreme dedication towards Andrew, a man she loves, and gets flustered when thinking about, as she patiently waits for his return and believes in him completely. She is a bit oblivious about short human lifespans though, thinking that Andrew would return even after 200 years.

She explains that without this cord she cannot function, and informs them that the path is through a large door. She states she will not deny any who wishes to go through but also that there is no guarantee that they will make it out alive, giving them a warning that they should come back to the chamber if they feel their lives are threatened.

   , she is asked by Shiki about the clue to Mother at the end of the cave. She informs them that it is something he must discover for themselves and that it is a secret. Rebecca asks her about the bots outside and asks what happened. She tells her that the treasure that was guarded and worshiped since ancient times, where countless adventurers visited the temple in hopes to for a glimpse of it as it held a beacon that would guide them to Mother. The treasure was unfortunately stolen from them 200 years ago, without the Ether radiating from it, all of the androids began to shut down. Happy asks Nadia if she was affected too, which she confirms that she did shut down, but Andrew repaired her by attaching the cable to her back.

   Nadia then goes on about Andrew, becoming flustered the more she talks about him. Rebecca asks what happened to him, where Nadia states that he went to retrieve the treasure and left the planet 200 years ago. She is determined to wait for him as long as it takes until he returns, as he promised to come back. She notes to Shiki and his friends that although the treasure is lost, the beacon remains and will remain indefinitely, easing their worries on that. Nadia also mentions that Ziggy was but one of many adventurers who obtained the beacon.
   She admires how beautiful the new visitors are, informing Witch that Ziggy came alone.

   . Nadia corrects him, that it chose a vessel and went inside of it on its own. She explains that the treasure was a part of Mother, where this piece radiated Mother Ether and its residue remained even after the treasure was lost. Clarifying to Rebecca that it is possible to find Mother with the Ether. She expounds that it is said there are many pieces of Mother across the cosmos, called Relics, that they may be found anywhere from being worshiped, hidden, or even wandering through space. She tells them that the Mother Ether works as a compass to other Relics, and when they find enough Relics and absorbed their Ether then it might take them to Mother. She confirms Laguna's conjecture that it does not matter how much of the temple's Ether they absorb, as absorbing Mother Ether from other places will change its properties and strengthen it. Though noting that it is a theory from she heard from Andrew.

   With this, the Crew of Edens decides to leave, and Nadia is thanked by Happy and Pino hopes that she meets Andrew again. However Witch decides to tell her that Andrew is dead, telling her that humans cannot live that long, but Nadia denies it as he promised to come back. Witch confirms that he kept his promise, but he is not alive, telling her that his ship crash-landed recently and that the passenger's dead body is Andrew. Witch reveals a memory chip that she found in his ship, where Nadia asks to see it. Pino plays the recording of Andrew, delighting her to see Andrew again, where he explains that he successfully retrieved the treasure from a petty crook and is coming back already, apologizing that it took a year, and states his love for her. Unfortunately, the recording cuts short after a meteoroid struck his ship. Witch presumes that it rendered him unconscious and unable to steer, knocking his ship off course and crash-landed on the planet after 200 years. Struck with grief, Nadia runs out to find him, tearing the cable off from her back.

   At the crash site of the ship, Nadia finds his corpse, crying that Andrew is dead. Witch tells her that a human's life is short compared to that of machines. Nadia sees now that a human cannot live for 200 years and asks if it is wrong for a machine to love a human, but Witch denies, stating that they can all love whomever they choose. The mourning android asks what good would it do to live in a world without Andrew, but Witch comforts her that the souls of those they've lost exist within their hearts, but Nadia retorts that androids do not have hearts. Witch claims that the fact she feels love for someone is proof that she does have a heart as Nadia continues to mourn. Weisz insists that they need to repair the cable, but Rebecca stops him as Andrew said that he got the Relic back so she does not need it anymore. Nadia and the others see the Relic, a

The water starts receding, where she explains that the planet is returning to its rightful state after the return of the Relic.
