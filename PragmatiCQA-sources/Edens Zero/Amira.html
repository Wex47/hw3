   Amira is a young curvy woman of average height with brown eyes and blonde hair. Her hair has pigtails on the ends with a green leaf-shaped hairpin on it and wears a diamond-shaped necklace. Her attire consists of an open, long-sleeved black jumpsuit with stocking-like edges, a knee-pack around her right thigh, and matching high-heeled shoes.

  <p key="b521ee8f-1e57-4199-b085-b8bb27e61d8e">
   Amira is a very meticulous spy in her work as a Galactic Intelligence Agency member and seeks to capture Drakken even if it means sacrificing people outside her mission, be they humans, Machines, or Digitalis NPCs.
   She also shows that she has a somewhat perverse sense of humor.
  </p>
  <p key="235a7ae8-e6e1-4ee4-9ba7-d5677f1d0a99">
   Amira can be quite manipulative as she gains Shiki's trust when allying herself with the Edens Zero crew to take down Drakken by asking to start over as friends than enemies with an empty apology, knowing that Shiki can't resist the word "friend" after looking through Homura's memories.

After saying goodbye, Amira notes how the realism of the world will make it hard for them to distinguish players from the NPCs. She notes that they must stay vigilant in case of players with bad intentions, they split up to ask around town where Amira converses with two village girls.
   Afterwards, Amira convene with the others at Benjamin's Inn, having found out that someone may have seen her in a town to the north, and decide to sleep for the night.
   The next morning, Rebecca comically scolds her crewmates and Amira about their bizarre sleeping habits.

   An enraged Shiki charges towards Jamilov as the murderer's scythe bites off his long hair, Amira witnesses the monstrous weapon's growth and dodges as it rushes towards them.
   Jamilov decides to retreat after Shiki throws the remains of the tower at him, where she and the others gather. They are soon found by the surviving townspeople, who thanks them for getting rid of Jamilov and tells them that Hermit is by the hill on the west side of town.
   Before they go to the hills, Amira tells Weisz that she is going to check out the city.
   She strolls through the streets of Crysta, where she is called into an alley by

She sneaks off as the others prepare to fight and turns on her private chat mode, where she inquires about Jesse's safety, which he confirms. She notes the strange situation they are mixed in, asking about Jamilov's location to finish her job quickly and owes her fellow spy. Amira comments that Shiki and his crew are not bad people, but have served their purpose after Jesse asks about her abandoning them.

   She arrives back at town with Jamilov, taking an imp soldier's crossbow and aims for a little girl NPC but Shiki intercepts, getting hit in the arm. Jamilov comments that he did not think she would kill her own ally. However, Amira firmly claims that he is not her ally.
   They are shocked that their friend is betraying them. She tells him that the girl he's protecting is nothing more than computer data, but he counters that she is a living person. She responds that she is only running her fear emotion program, but Shiki states she has a heart. She tells him that she will be joining Drakken Joe and pretends that Homura's search for

   Before the arrows hit, the real Homura arrives and cuts them. She explains how she was in a jail cell when she arrived and took two days to escape and gather the information that led her here. She angrily points at her impostor. This agitates Amira, claiming that she was so close.
   With her plan failing and Jamilov deciding to kill everyone, she makes her escape, but Homura goes after her.
   In the forest Amira summons her steed, where Homura does the same. She is called out for her odd riding posture and remembers that she does not need to mimic her behavior anymore. She explains that she can copy a person's appearance, personality, and memories. She took the liberty of using Homura to help her get close to Jamilov. However, because the mission has failed, she states that she wants her pursuer to disappear now. Introducing herself as a member of the Galactic Intelligence Agency, Homura points out how a spy like her is loose-lipped as she is, surprising Amira as she was still copying Homura's personality tic.

   As the chase continues, Amira expresses that her objective was to use Jamilov to take on Drakken Joe, her actual target. The spy tells Homura that she could have used anyone's account, but had used her's due to having the least amount of security. Amira talks to herself about how Jesse knows Homura, confusing her pursuer. She loads her gun and apologizes to her pursuer, saying that if she stayed in her cell in she would not have to die. She fires, but Homura deflects it and each subsequent bullet. Amire aims one at the Tantimo's leg, causing Homura to fall off. Amira laughs at the sight and changes her gun into its sniper mode and fires at Homura. However, the swordswoman manages to deflect it back to her at such a distance, surprising the agent, and logs out just before it hits. She exits her pod and reflects upon that moment, before smiling that no one will ever catch her.

   At first they do not recognize her, which she remembers that only Homura knows her real appearance and briefly puts on her prince disguise from Digitalis to refresh their memory, shocking them. She calms the group down, dispelling her prince facade, stating that she showed them her face because she trusts them and wants them to trust her.

She adds that while she cannot copy a person's abilities, she can copy their memories and their thoughts. Amira answers Sibir's question that she wants to know his weakness as her mission was to bring it back to her organization, saying that they should save it for later. She then says that thanks to them she could go back now that she knows how to defeat Drakken. However, since they want to beat Drakken she wants to join them in their plan. She is dismayed to see that Shiki is still skeptical, she apologizes for what happened on Digitalis and wants to start over as friends. Shiki believes her, while she thinks to herself how she knows about his susceptibility to the word "friend" from Homura's memories. After this, She asks them if they can show her the way to the Life Support Device. Suddenly, the floor is turned into

   to make the tar floor fall, freeing everyone. Amira is in awe of the boy's power over gravity and falls through the floor with the others.
   Landing on the floor below safely, Amira reminds everyone that they should use this opportunity to get to the Life Support Device while Shiki fights Drakken. She is perplexed by their lack of faith in their crewmate and states that all of them are going to be needed to defeat Drakken and explains each of their roles, apart from

She then reveals that the device powers itself by absorbing the life force of the people living around it, resulting in the lives of countless people from the Belial Gore and previously

She answers Happy's question that she does not know how exactly it works, but states that the citizens of the Belial Gore have no idea that a little bit of their life force is being taken away from them every day by the device that uses the energy to keep Drakken alive. Amira bluntly reveals that the

   Amira answers Weisz's question that victims whose life force has been drained over a long period of time will suffer a shorter lifespan, having heard that the unlucky ones die. Seeing an upset Weisz running, she tells Rebecca and Happy to bring him back as they need him to remodel the Life Support Device. She explains to Pino that there is no point in stopping the device and that they have to put it in reverse to give the people's life force back and make the Drakken weaker. Amira growls in annoyance that they needed Weisz to do that and wonders what has gotten into him. Suddenly Hermit contacts the group, where Amira recognizes her from Digitalis. Amira asks what they need to destroy which Hermit specifies the Security Device. She pleads Jinn to take

   After Hermit finishes her hacking on the Life Support Device to reverse Drakken's energy flow, Amira answers Sibir's question with the reassurance that if her predictions are correct, the Dark Alchemist will be weakened.
   Suddenly, the Life Support Device starts exploding and the room starts falling apart, making a panicking Amira wonder what is happening before telling the group that they are getting out of there. She watches as Pino is saved by Sibir from  some falling debris, and tells them to pick up the pace or be left behind.
   Amira and the group runs as fast as they can to escape the crumbling room.

   After escaping, Amira and the others find Shiki and Weisz. She stands over Drakken lying on the ground and comments that they actually took down Sakura Cosmos' biggest threat, seeing it as a big deal. Rebecca's group arrives and Homura recognizes her in surprise, Amira awkwardly greets the irritated swordswoman and sweetly claims that she is Shiki's new friend, acting as if it is the first time they are meeting and tries to calm her down. After the defeat of Drakken, Amira calls in the
