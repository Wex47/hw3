He has a set of distinct, dark-colored tattoos covering half of his upper body. When he is first introduced, Shura is shirtless in a pair of dark-colored pants with a belt, along with a metal chain with a cyclopean skull-shaped pendant around his neck. He has several intricate rings on his fingers and a metal armband on his right wrist.
   Later on, he wears an open jacket with a fur collar and a symbol of the Nero Empire at the back.

Entering the command center, Shura is saluted by the members of the Imperial Army and informed by the general that all of their troops are in position. When the Imperial Army general reassures him that the Interstellar Union Army will never break through their defenses with a fleet that small, Shura casually sits down on his chair of the main desk and lazily orders him to shoot them down.
   Viewing the space battle between the Imperial Army ships and Eraser's forces, the prince excitedly finds it awesome and wonders how many have died in battle. After the general assumes Ijuna is the prince's consort, Shura reassures him that she is his secretary. However, when the older military officer is about to reveal who Ijuna used to be, he lifts the man in the air and chokes him with Satan Gravity. A livid Shura emphasizes to the general that Ijuna is his secretary. When the general pleads with him to spare his life and states that his daughter's wedding is in next week, Shura retorts that he does not care. With a sadistic look, the prince exclaims to the old man that he is a grunt, and grunts are supposed to shut up and do what they are told. Shura demonstrates what will happen to people who insult him, the ruler of the Aoi Cosmos by brutally crushing the general to death in a bloody manner, horrifying the officers of the command center while Ijuna remains impassive. Giggling, the prince remarks that this will happen to Eraser too. Then Shura casually notes that this show does not have too many fireworks and asks his subordinates if they can just wipe the Interstellar Union Army forces with a big battleship which they comply with immediately.

   Confronting the interlopers alone outside of the command center, Shura effortlessly stops the Edens Zero in mid-air with his gravity.
   He is surprised to see someone exiting the ship to confront him alone and smirks, releasing the Edens Zero from his grasp.
   Facing his opponent who asks him if he is Shura, the prince confirms his identity and questions the boy for his name in turn. After learning the boy's name to be Shiki and his intention to stop him, Shura wonders how does he know Ziggy. The prince laughs upon hearing from Shiki that the Demon King was his grandfather, commenting that he is a robot. After Shiki states that it doesn't matter if someone's a human or a machine, Shura remarks that he got no right to talk as he is the son of Nero whom he calls a monster. Casually walking towards Shiki, the prince questions him if he's working for Ziggy and finds it skeptical when the latter claims that he is going to stop the Demon King too. Standing up close to him, Shura derisively calls Shiki a peasant and informs him that commoners are supposed to live humble lives. He states that they don't get around expecting to get what they want and only the Royal Family is allowed to do that. Shura raises his right hand to crush Shiki with gravity and asks the boy if he gets it. Despite his opponent catching his hand and counter his gravity with his own, Shura wonders if this is all he got after the former is buckling on the ground from his power. He humorously finds Shiki lightweight after the latter attempted to use gravity on him. Suddenly, the prince is thrown into the air by Shiki much to his surprise. He is punched in the face by Shiki in mid-air which angers him before he is then struck again and sent crashing hard into the ground. Lying on the crater with mild injuries, Shura remarks with a smirk that Shiki is not bad.
   Floating himself back up on his feet, Shura compares their gravity powers, saying that while Shiki's power focuses on altering his personal gravity, his power is focused on moving objects. After this, the prince spreads his arms and pulls out a ship from the ground where he remarks to a surprised Shiki that there are all kinds of junk buried under here. Declaring that he will bury the boy and Edens Zero down there with it, Shura then disassembles it and launches the parts at Shiki. When the Demon King's grandson catches one of the parts, Shura is surprised but then disassembles the parts he threw at Shiki to throw smaller ones at him. Dashing towards his opponent, the prince then goes to elbow Shiki before punching him on the stomach and then the head, with his opponent trying to land another hit on him. But the prince easily dodges it before kicking the Demon King's grandson down into one of the ship's parts. When Shiki notes that Shura is also altering his own gravity, the prince retorts that he never said he couldn't.
   Shura and Shiki continue to exchange blows on top of the ship's large part in the air. After Shiki punches his face and demands that he turns off the All-Link System, Shura punches back and exclaims they don't need live machines, stating that they should be used as tools for humankind while tying Shiki up with the ship's wires he controls after catching him off guard. The son of Nero then taunts if Shiki can use Ether Gear while being tied up before he is surprised to see the boy use

   Shura confirms to Shiki that he wants him to be his friend and explains that he has never met anybody like the Demon King's grandson until now, stating that they can totally be buddies. After Shiki tells him that he can't be friends with someone who doesn't think robot lives are worth anything, the prince asks the boy if he can't be friends with someone who has different values than him. Extending his hand, the son of Nero states that they have the same goal and offers Shiki that they can beat Ziggy together. When Shiki requests him to stop his plan of destroying machines if he agrees to be his friend, Shura shrugs and remarks that he will consider it. He waits for Shiki to come down and take his hand. However, the prince tries to tell the Demon King's grandson to think about the robots trying to take the rights away from humans and if they let them get away with it, the Aoi Cosmos will be taken over. With a manic face, Shura states that if Shiki is his friend, he would understand and that they don't need live bots. After Shiki rejects his offer of friendship, the prince understands and signals the Imperial Army robots to appear before him and the boy. Shura retorts at Shiki who believed the fight was between themselves if he really believed that. Using his gravity to float away to his troops on the high ground, he declares that he is bored with his fellow Satan Gravity wielder now and lets the Imperial robots take it from here. Shura corrects Shiki that they are hunks of metal about to be scrapped and he wouldn't call them friends. He orders the bot soldiers to attack the Demon King's grandson. Smiling with glee, the prince encourages them to keep up the assault, stating that it is their last job in the Imperial Army and they should not disappoint him. Shura remarks that he almost admired the Imperial machines for giving their all despite they will be destroyed by this time tomorrow, and mockingly informs them that Shiki whom they assaulted is a nice boy who sees the bots as friends. Bidding Shiki goodbye in a cheeky manner, Shura leaves the battlefield with his gravity at high speed.

He comments that Shiki is massacring a bunch of robots down there and asks the Shining Star how do they feel to see their dear leader picking on fellow androids only for Hermit to retort that it doesn't matter whether if it's a human or machine as a friend is a friend and foe is a foe.

   When a captive Witch regains consciousness, Shura greets her and answers her question about her fellow Shining Stars that he "knocked them around a little" but assures her they aren't dead.

After hearing from Ijuna that she is known as the "Steel Sorceress" upon identifying her, Shura mocks Witch that she is so soft and grabbed her chest much to her discomfort, laughing at her. Letting go, the prince notes that she's almost like a human before snapping his finger to summon a knife from the table with his gravity and directed it to stab Witch on her left arm, making her bleed. Shura removes the knife and comment that Witch feels pain, which pleases him with a sadistic look that he is going to get a lot of fun out of the female android. He answers Witch's question of why he's doing all this stating that he wants to beat Ziggy. Shura brings up the Foresta incident and explains to the Shield of Edens that the Verdant Planet was his planet as all planets in the Aoi Cosmos belong to him. Spinning around the knife in his hand, Shura states that he won't stand by and let the Demon King act like he owned his cosmos, calling Ziggy a "

He informs a barely conscious Witch that this is what he was after from the start. Shura notes that if Ziggy and his father fight each other, one of them will die and his money is on the Demon King winning. Smiling maniacally, Shura states that once Nero dies, the Aoi Cosmos and everything in it will be finally his. He rebuts Witch to not talk to him about family and declares that he is tired playing with her.

   Standing casually over Witch's unconscious and damaged form on the floor, Shura tells Shiki for taking too long after noticing the arrival of the Demon King's grandson and his friends. The prince comments that he was playing with her and she broke, enraging Shiki.

   Sneering, he rebuts to Shiki that the only thing getting crushed around here is the boy's head.
   Clashing against Shiki with gravity, Shura is confused of the boy's words about the lights in space going off before he is struck hard on the head.
   Wiping blood from his mouth and getting up from the floor, Shura asks Shiki if he knows what is going on at The Temple right now, and reveals that his father and Ziggy are fighting there. He tells Shiki that his money is on Ziggy and that it has gone exactly according to his plan, stating that if Nero dies, all of Aoi Cosmos will be his and he doesn't care who wins the fight between old men. However, Shura reveals that the All-Link System connects every planet including The Temple and that there are 20,000 electronically-controlled

   . He shows his lack of care for the people living on The Temple and states that he treats their lives lightly, upsetting Shiki. Lifting the pieces from the floor with gravity, Shura mocks Shiki for his pretty ideals before attacking his fellow gravity user. He jumps towards Shiki in mid-air and kicks him in the stomach, sending him flying through 3 floors above. Catching up to him, Shura asks the boy if his life carries weight in his mind and recalls that he did a lot of damage to Witch. Further enraging Shiki, he remarks that the female android reacted just like a real human and if he had the time, he would have loved to make her his pet and take her out for walkies. Then with a dark smile, Shura states that it is not going to happen as All-Link System will activate any minute now and all of the bots in Aoi Cosmos are going to die. He is shocked to see Shiki using Overdrive but then easily blocks his opponent's punch with his left arm. Shura smirks as he did not expect Shiki to possess Overdrive. Revealing that he has Overdrive too and uses it, he comments now it is just a boring fight to the death if that's how it is going to be. Advising Shiki to not underestimate his power of gravity, Shura raises his left hand to tear out Shiki's left eyeball and crushes it in his palm.

   Shura rushes toward Shiki, who reels in pain of his eyeball's loss, and punches him in the face with his right fist before bombarding the boy with multiple gravity-empowered punches. He raises his right leg and strikes Shiki, causing the floor to crack and crumble. The prince is struck in the face by Shiki's retaliation and coughs up blood. Angered, he unleashes Heavy Rain on the boy before lifting a boulder and shapes it into an intricate spear with gravity. He throws Heavy Lance at Shiki, piercing him in the stomach. Smirking, Shura asks the boy if he now understands what it means to be on a different league and watches him collapse on the floor.
   Leaving his Overdrive form and crushing all of the Imperial Army soldiers into bloody paste at the All-Link System's room, Shura tells a horrified Rebecca and her friends that this is real gravity as he hovers over them from above. He informs them that Shiki is dead and pins them on the floor with gravity. The prince reminds the B-Cuber and the two bots that it is not hard to crush people but after noting they did come all the way here, he decides to let them watch him instead. Activating the All-Link System, he tells them to watch him destroy every bot in the Aoi Cosmos and states to Rebecca that her little robot friends are going to fall into pieces. Basking in his impeding triumph, Shura declares that every single planet is now connected in the huge space network and the first thing he will do is to blow up the Temple. He declares his victory, only to be surprised when Nero contacts him and asks him if he is jesting. Shura is surprised when Nero tells him that the word "victory" exists only for the Emperor and there is no victory for him. Confused, he recalls to his father about Ziggy attacking the Nero Empire capital planet. Shura is shocked when Nero reveals the damaged head of Ziggy he holds in his hand and realized that his father defeated the Demon King. The prince is surprised after the Emperor informs him that it is over for him and that he used his Ether Gear

Upset of being outwitted, a spluttering Shura tries to call off Nero's claims as a bluff and rebuts that he never heard anything about his father possessing an Ether Gear, finding it ridiculous about such feat of transporting the bombs to another planet. Taking Nero's dare if either The Temple or Nero 66 obliterates, Shura still believes that his father is bluffing as he is about to activate the All-Link System. He proclaims that he is the winner, telling his father to die. Suddenly, Shura is struck from above by a still-alive Shiki who dropkicks him on the head and states that their fight isn't over yet.

He is shocked by Shiki's rebuke that he and his friends are going forward before witnessing the latter form a powerful gravity orb on his hand, questioning it. Panicking, Shura pleads Shiki to not strike him with it. After Shiki directly hits him with the
