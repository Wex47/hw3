   In the past, Nero was an old friend of Ziggy and considers the Demon King to be a wise and thoughtful man he could call a friend. At some point, Nero created his empire in the Aoi Cosmos in a single generation with the power of his Ether and the guiding dice.

   15 years ago, Nero adopted Shura as his son after the guiding dice told him and intended to pass his power to him, but the boy was incompatible.
   Instead, Shura was taught by Ziggy how to use

   He asks his son to leave him and Ziggy alone, watching the boy run off the room. When the Demon King pointed out that Shura is a human, Nero simply explains to his old friend that he is a child chosen by the guiding dice but was incompatible with his power before Ziggy came along.

Rolling the guiding dice on the table, he wonders what has happened to the skull-faced bot. When Shura protests his use of the dice to make important decisions by chance, Nero tells his son to hold his tongue. He explains to Shura that the eyes of his dice will never betray him for that is the power of his Ether, and it is with this power that he built his empire in a single generation for they are his "Sacred Guiding Dice". Glancing at the results of rolling the dice on the table with a contemplating look, Nero remains silent as Fabiano asks him what do their eyes tell him. Getting up from his chair to leave, the Emperor states that if it is their fate, he must obey and declares that he will do nothing, surprising his son and the members of Oceans 6. Exiting the meeting room, Nero tells Shura that he will leave the matter with the Demon King entirely in his hands. When Shura wonders if his father means that, the Emperor explains to his son that he is not so foolish as to defy the dice.

Nero states that the dice will never betray him and that it does not matter whether if his son resorts to foolish tactics, if his empire falls, or if millions or even billions of people die, the ultimate result will be the same. With a serious face, the Emperor confidently declares to a horrified Fabiano that he will be victorious in the end and that fate has already been determined and will remain unchanged as long as he possesses the absolute power of the "Emperor Dice".

He attacks the Demon King with his dice, which are momentarily stopped, but maneuvers around to strike again. Nero refutes Ziggy for thinking his dice cannot be affected by gravity and explains that the Empire Dice are not a ranged weapon but a

Nero adds that he simply obeys the eyes of his dice and always triumph for he built his empire with them. Though, he reveals that his victories always come with a price; the lives of his friends, his family, and his people, and notes that all who were by his side have faded. Nevertheless, he confidently proclaims that he has always been victorious thanks to the power of the Empire Dice and attacks Ziggy once more. However, he is surprised when Ziggy brings down an
