   The remaining troops of the Nero Empire are forced to retreat and pulled out of Sandra. However, dozens of Imperial soldiers, especially the child soldier who refuses to retreat and foolishly tried to take on the rebels by himself, are captured and taken prisoner by Oasis. One of the captured soldiers tells Ibaraki that the Nero Empire doesn't bargain with prisoners and states they are no use to them now. He finds Ibaraki foolish if Oasis thinks they can beat the Nero Empire before Goodwin appears before the prisoners, intimidating them with his giant size. After Goodwin is upset that 16 of his subordinates died to the Imperials, one brave prisoner called out to the giant cat that their comrades died too, despite his fellow soldiers' protests of fear of provoking Goodwin, and points out that Oasis are not the only ones. The Imperials are shocked when Goodwin sits down on the ground and acknowledges the brave prisoner, saying that he is right. They listen to Goodwin listing out the wrongdoings of the Nero Empire and are scared after the Oasis rebel leader declares his hate for it, fearing that he will bring his wrath on them. But the prisoners are stunned when Goodwin states that while he hates the Nero Empire, he doesn't hate them and offers them to get together for drinks and B-Cube concerts when the war is over.
