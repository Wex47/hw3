   Shiki declares that he will instead plunder the Skull Fairy from Elsie as he's in need of a large ship which shocks his comrades. Elsie gives him directions on where he can find her and closes off the communications between them. Shiki runs off but Rebecca expresses doubts that Shiki could beat someone as infamous as Elsie Crimson. Shiki discovers that the ship is infested with disgusting alien growths and finds a crowd of space pirates shuffling towards him. Prepared to fight, Shiki is shocked when the arms of the pirates all transform into tentacles and begin to attack him. Quickly recovering, Shiki defeats several of them with ease as he proclaims space is awesome.

   Shiki faces off against Elsie and remarks that her skull-like face must mean she isn't human. Elsie demands to see the power than he inherited from the Demon King but before he can get an explanation from her, she launches an immediate attack and slaps him backwards with a tentacle. Shiki redirects gravity to move to the ceiling but Elsie is on him too quickly for him to react and she slams him back down to the ground. Evading more of her attacks, he attempts to launch a Magimech Attack at her but is hit once again before he can do it. In a flashback, Shiki recalls his youth where he sparred with the Demon King and was unable to beat him. The Demon King used his

   In the present, Shiki punches back Elsie and demands to know what she is. Elsie simply repeats her introduction back to him and asks who he is. Shiki declares himself as Shiki, an adventurer, that plans to go find Mother outside of the Sakura Cosmos. When Elsie counters this as being a vain goal, Shiki resumes the fight. In the past, Shiki asks why his grandfather has stopped moving and tries to fix him. Michael tries to explain that it is too late but Shiki refuses to accept it as his grandfather hadn't even taught him the Gravity Comet yet.

   . Victory declares that today he will finally arrest Elsie Crimson. An abnormal ether reaction aboard the Skull Fairy gets his attention and he recognizes that it is not Elsie's ether. Shiki continues to fight Elsie while Elsie explains that even Demon King Ziggy himself could not find Mother which surprises Shiki. The levels of Shiki's ether approach a hundred thousand as he activates Gravity Gear through his entire body and he launches himself at Elsie, taking her down with the Gravity Comet.

   The Skull Fairy’s self-repair systems fix the damage done by Shiki to the hull of the ship as he stands over the unconscious body of the defeated Elsie Crimson. Rebecca, Weisz, Pino and Happy find Shiki after tracking the noise caused by his devastation and they question if the person he defeated is really Elsie. As they watch however, the body of Elsie dissolves into a pile of goop from which a

   emerges in its true form. The laughter of the real Elsie Crimson fills the room and she appears once more on a holographic screen and gives the group a quick backstory on the parasitic lifeforms and how they infested the Skull Fairy. Elsie admits that she has been on another ship the whole time and announces that she is giving the Skull Fairy to Shiki and his friends. She goes on to explain that the ship used to belong to the Demon King Ziggy in the past before it fell into her hands, and that she always intended to hand the ship over to Shiki.

   to raise as he knew he was dying. Pino is saddened to learn about the death of her master. Elsie finishes her story by telling them that the Demon King told her to give the ship to Shiki when he left Granbell and that she fulfilled his request because she owed him a lot. Despite hearing the full story Shiki is reluctant to just accept the ship from her but Elsie reassures him that one ship is nothing compared to her entire fleet which stuns the group. One of Elsie's crewmembers reveals that the Interstellar Union Army has them surrounded and they are beginning to fire warning shots at Elsie's fleet. Elsie offers to fight off the Interstellar Union Army in order to buy time for Shiki and the others to escape. Shiki thanks her for the help and for the ship and remarks that since she was a friend of his grandfather, then that make her his friend too. Elsie smiles at that and reveals one final fact, that the Demon King told her that anyone who reaches Mother will be born again.
