   devouring the planet's 1,200 years of time, as a life is a life.
   Despite that, Justice is obsessed with capturing and/or killing Elsie as his one and only interest due to a great loss he suffered from her in the past.
   It goes to the point that the soldier is also willing to kill Shiki who has ties with the Armored Space Pirate and imprison his friend Homura while stating that Ziggy or Poseidon Nero means nothing to him despite the dire situation happening on Foresta.
   Justice is confident in his abilities as an Ether Gear master, reminding Victory about it with a small smirk.
   He is also a stickler for rules, according to Eraser.

   He was betrothed to Elsie at a young age, who was a princess from another kingdom on the planet, where their union was a means to unite both kingdoms. During their time together at the castle's courtyard, Elsie proposed to James that they should kiss, flustering the young prince. He retorts how that their parents decided for them to get married so Elsie's kingdom could absorb his, but Elsie prepares for the kiss anyway. Blushing he nervously tries but is stopped by the young princess, saying that they should wait until they are older, flustering him more.
   Later on, it is revealed that the government had plans which were capable of destroying the entire Kaede Cosmos, as pointed out by Elsie.

   James had planned to change the nation, but Elsie had taken action first and exposed the secrets of her kingdom, which resulted in war. James lost everything and was forced to abandon his planet. As a result of the war, James abandoned his name and took on the codename "Justice" as his new identity upon joining the Interstellar Union Army, living up to his goal to bring justice throughout the Cosmos.

Having found his target within the vicinity, Justice vows in the name of the Interstellar Union Army that today is the day he will take her in. Victory jokes that Justice's pursuit of Elsie is starting to sound like a love story, but the joke is not understood by Justice. Suddenly, Justice detects

   He wonders what is happening on that ship, while noting that there has not been any change in Elsie's Ether.
   As the Interstellar Union Army fleet surrounds Elsie's space pirate fleet and is within firing range, Justice declares that it is time to bring down "the hammer of justice" before his forces open fire in a barrage of warning shots.

Ignoring Victory's protests, Justice orders him and Creed to return to the Angel Feather, declaring that he will be operating as a member of the Oración Seis Interstellar from now on. When Shiki charges at him for taking Homura, Justice reveals that he cares more about Elsie's capture than Ziggy or Nero, claiming that if Shiki has ties to Elsie, that is reason enough for him to kill the young man. He easily blocks Shiki's Satan Gravity-empowered punch with his right hand and declares that in the name of justice, he will not let him see tomorrow.

   After blocking the young man's punch, Justice explains that the Interstellar Union Army was formed to strike down the evil that runs rampant through the cosmos, be it the Oración Seis Galáctica, Ziggy, or lawless space voyagers like Shiki. He then throws Shiki back and notes that the Edens Zero is an unregistered ship formerly owned by Ziggy and Elsie. The Oración Seis Interstellar member believes that this will require further investigation which angers Shiki into charging at him again. Easily blocking the gravity wielder's spinning axe kick with his right arm, Justice tells the young man that he is about to die with no future beyond this point, charging an Ether blast from his left palm, and fires at Shiki who dodges it and sticks at the tree in a safe distance, noting how aggressive the government he is working for. Justice questions if Shiki is trying to say that his government is oppressive, but admits that there are certain protocols that must be followed, such as not harming civilians. However, Justice reveals that those of the Oración Seis Interstellar are given certain privileges and they have the right, in any situation, to eradicate any target they determine to be evil. Activating his Ether Gear, Justice believes that despite being a mere boy, with the Demon King's power in his Ether and his link with Elsie, Shiki will certainly become a great evil one day if allowed to live.

   In his transformed state, the Oración Seis Interstellar member declares that he will execute Shiki right here and now in the name of justice. Using Meteor, Justice attacks Shiki in a lariat strike with incredible speed and throws him several meters across Foresta. Easily catching up to Shiki, Justice attacks the young man only to miss and hit the ground instead. However, Justice quickly appears behind Shiki and knocks him down from the sky before flying below, and knee the young man in the chin, followed by an elbow strike on the head. Then Justice assaults Shiki in multiple directions with Meteor Frenzy, heavily injuring his opponent. Overhearing a shocked Shiki trying to comprehend his power, Justice asks him in a derisive tone if Elsie hid her abilities from her friends. The soldier reveals to Shiki that he uses the same Ether Gear as hers; Star Drain, allowing him to absorb a planet's Ether and make it his own. Justice explains that this power is equivalent to "Heavenly Body Magic" which was feared in the Dark Ages, a force that could control the stars. Intending to finish off the young man in one powerful attack, Justice unleashes Grand Chariot on the grandson of the Demon King.
   When the smoke clears away, Justice is surprised to see Shiki is still alive after being struck by his attack. Summoning Antares in his hands, the soldier describes it as "a spear of light to pierce evil" and intends to put the injured boy on the ground out of his misery. Suddenly, his strike is blocked by Elsie wielding her own Antares, becoming enraged upon seeing her and lividly mutters her name.

He changes his Antares into a katana and declares a sentence of death to Elsie for violation of cosmic travel laws and multiple other crimes. Justice clashes his weapon with Elsie's own katana, causing a massive shockwave of Ether that is seen across Foresta.
   Justice and Elsie clash their swords against each other, causing shockwaves that destroy the surrounding area around them. After Elsie notes that he had gotten better in their fight, using his real name James Holloway. However, Justice states that he abandoned that name long ago and calls her a traitor to the fatherland. When the Armored Space Pirate claims that the nation had no meaning, the soldier powers up and angrily retorts that he lost everything in that so-called meaningless nation because of her treachery. Using Meteor, Justice tackles Elsie, taking them several meters away into an abandoned city in Foresta. He sends Elsie flying into the wall of a building with a hammer fist strike. He tries to hit her with a kick but she uses Meteor and dodges out of the way.

   The two continue their sword fight whilst flying in the air. After Elsie expresses that she also lost everything, the Oración Seis Interstellar member retorts back that if she had not betrayed them, they would not have lost everything. Jumping out of Elsie's strike that shattered the entire building into pieces, Justice calls her reasoning behind her betrayal to be twisted logic. While battling in the air and hearing her accusation towards him for not knowing what the government's plotting, the soldier retaliates that with his faith in justice that he was going to change the government and he would have made it a better nation. He points out that Elsie started the war after she told the truth about the government. Engaged in a close range grappling hold against each other, the Interstellar member mocks Elsie as the mighty princess who is now a lowly pirate, commenting that there truly is justice in the cosmos. Justice is confused by Elsie's question if he remembers their past as children.
   After both have stopped their respective Meteors, Justice is not amused by Elsie's proposal to fulfill their childhood promise in a teasing manner. However, Justice moves closer to Elsie for the kiss and states that it will engender nothing. Upon their first kiss, the two simultaneously stabs each other in the abdomen with their katanas much to their surprise. Staggering from his wound, the soldier comments that he knew it would engender nothing and reaffirms his conviction to kill Elsie.

In mid-air, Justice, and Elsie simultaneously unleash Grand Chariot against each other, causing massive destruction.

The soldier remains silent when Eraser explains to him and Jaguar that there are 3,200 Imperial Army ships on their frontline and they are about ten times the size of his Interstellar Union Army fleet of 250 ships, along with the fact that he has no way of knowing how many ships are hiding behind them or are waiting on the planet's surface but reassures them to not worry about it.

   When 10,000 Nero Empire ships appear, Justice arrives in his starfighter and attacks a number of them at full speed. He channels his Star Drain through his starfighter's Ether Link and unleashes Grand Chariot upon the Imperial Army, devastating multiple ships in his path much to the shock of the

   He easily maneuvers his starfighter around enemy gunfire, noticing unidentified signatures in their friendlies' signals and asks Eraser about them. He is told that they are the rebel army, irritating him that they are working with a civilian organization. He then informs Eraser that Jaguar had another matter to attend to and states to his exasperated teammate that what the captain is doing is to help the Aoi Cosmos. He blasts away more Imperial ships with ease and declares that they are going to put a stop to Nero's ambition.

   He is surprised when he recognizes the broad-range open transmission to be from the Edens Zero.
   When Eraser orders all Interstellar Union Army forces to leave the front immediately, the soldier questions him if he actually believe them and states that Creed and Jesse are still on Nero 66, questions if they are abandoning them. However, Justice receives a sound-only transmission from the G.I.A. agent who reports that he is no longer on the planet's surface but Creed is not with him. He is in stunned silence as the Angel Feather and its fleet withdraws.
   When Jesse boards the ship, Justice is informed that his subordinate is dead and that Edens Zero was responsible. Suddenly, a soldier of the Angel Feather informs him that a transport pod is approaching with a signal from Edens Zero stating that they are returning Creed's body. Justice wonders what the Crew of Edens is plotting as Jesse goes to check on the pod.
