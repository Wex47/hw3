   Laguna remains quiet as Drakken is pleased to see the Crew of Edens being shocked and afraid after Weisz loses his arm to Fie as a demonstration for defying the Dark Alchemist. Seeing Rebecca cry, he sees her tears which Daichi tells him that it is not the time to not turn her into water. Laguna understands and comments that it is real tears he is seeing.
   The Spirit of Water stays silent with Daichi as Drakken lectures Shiki and his friends that there are some people in the cosmos they should not mess with.
   He listens in silence when Shiki in tears tells his friends that it was not supposed to be like this in their adventure and tries to stand up to Drakken.

He tries to get her to eat and that sitting around won't change anything.

He tries to get her to understand from Drakken's view, as moneylenders can't do business if people think they're soft. He also points out that her crew invaded their ship first and that what happened was awful but is just how it is. He concedes after failing to get any response, but tells her to at least take a shower as her stench brings him to tears. He reassures her that they don't have surveillance cameras in the bathroom, as they're not that crude and leaves afterward.

She notes his previous occupation as an actor before he left show business and worked under Drakken Joe when she looked up his profile and asks him his reason to fight for the Dark Alchemist. In response, Laguna tells her that it is none of her business, which Witch understands. Laguna is then intimidated by Witch's serious proclamation that she is the Shield of Edens and her reason to fight is to protect her family from whatever enemy threatens them.

   At the computer terminal, Laguna stands silent as Hermit attempts to break through Müller's security and begins to overheat. He offers to cool her with his water by touching her on the shoulder, which she accepts. The actor remains quiet amidst the banter between Weisz and Hermit until he hears the still living cyborg head of Müller calling out her name.
   Laguna is stoically shocked to learn that the psychopathic scientist was responsible for ruining the Rutherford siblings' lives.
   He remains silent as Müller pathetically begs Hermit to spare his life.
   After Hermit punches the head of Müller into unconsciousness, Laguna scoffs that his tears are filthy.

After Rebecca tells him that it was a long story, Laguna comments that he can see why they would pick a fight with Drakken Joe. When Weisz corrects him that Elsie had nothing to do with as this was their fight, Laguna shrugs that he has a good point. The actor notes that the Crew of Edens could have teamed up with her but they didn't and does not understand them, annoying Weisz before leaving the Briefing Room. Walking through the hallway of the ship, Laguna internally muses to himself that until he accomplishes a certain goal, he will just keep playing the part: the part of a man who has no goal.

He asks Rebecca if she was too terrified to make the landfall. After hearing Weisz wondering if they are there yet, Laguna informs the Crew of Edens that they are here and shows them the entrance of the base which Homura finds rather suspicious. The actor tells Shiki that they can't talk about it here and knocks on the metal door. Laguna answers the password and is allowed to enter the base, surprising Shiki and his friends.

The former Element 4 member states that this may not get them to Nero but Oasis has a chance to crush Shura and the Crew of Edens wants their help. Laguna remains silent when Goodwin declares that he will deal with him and his failure to abide by their rules later.
   He answers a panicked Shiki that every planet in the Aoi Cosmos has an Ether atmosphere and they never really go underwater during an Aoi High Tide. Laguna implores Goodwin to help Shiki and his friends, informing him that the young man uses gravity just like Shura and he can defeat the Emperor's son. The former Element 4 member is mildly annoyed at Goodwin bluntly stating that Oasis doesn't need help from outsiders.

   He confirms to a shocked Goodwin that Hermit did say Edens Zero. After the Oasis rebel learns that Shiki defeated Drakken Joe, Laguna states it's just like him to know that and it's not exactly public information. He advises Goodwin if Oasis teams up with the Crew of Edens, they can win and beat Poseidon Nero.
   Laguna snarks at Homura for stating the obvious about Goodwin being quite a large man before she clarifies that she meant his heart.

Laguna remembers that while Goodwin is happy to work with the Edens Zero but then reminds him that he is another story and bluntly states that he doesn't like allies who betrayed his organization. After being told that the Oasis leader isn't that upset, the actor reminds Ibaraki that the latter aimed his gun at him earlier in their reunion, and it is true that he deserted the rebel army. He remarks that Ibaraki never changes before wondering that he hasn't seen the "Princess". Noticing Ibaraki's sorrowful face, Laguna learns from him that Shura killed the "Princess" and mangled her face. He sighs in sadness and agrees in a determined look with Ibaraki that they are going to avenge the "Princess" and take down Shura. Ending the call, Laguna is surprised to see Weisz eavesdropping on the conversation behind his back and explains to him that the "Princess" was the last boss' daughter, describing her to be bright, cheerful, and an indomitable spirit. He further reveals that the "Princess" and Goodwin have been the backbone of Oasis since the old boss died. Laguna tells Weisz that it's none of his business when the latter notes that the death of the "Princess" is a pretty heavy blow, and walks away. But Laguna stops after Weisz asks him if Nero is what he has been after all along. After Weisz believes that he is cozying up to them after Drakken's defeat, the former Element 4 member reminds him that it was Witch who asked him to join the Crew of Edens. Laguna remains quiet after Weisz deduces his pattern of bouncing from group to group, trying to find the one who can beat the Emperor. The actor remarks to Weisz that if he had an education, he might have joined the
