    Tenth Doctor

   possessed an outgoing, lively and genial demeanour that hid his
   underlying guilt
   , but it was still present and would appear if the Doctor was overwhelmed.

  <p key="54fe1280-17c9-4f6d-8bba-cee264cca756">
   For most of his life, the Doctor was able to successfully project a convivial and even frivolous front. However, when he had to engage in conflict, the Doctor's energies would shift to reveal a fiercely protective man who resolutely guarded what he held dear, and who could be viciously unforgiving to the forces that dared menace them.

   were shaped, to one degree or another, by
   romance
   ; he seemed to genuinely
   love
   his first companion,
   Rose Tyler
   , as the person who helped heal some of the scars of the
   Time War
   , was completely oblivious to
   Martha Jones
   ' obvious
   affections
   toward him, and insisted upon a platonic relationship with
   Donna Noble
   . The departure of each of these companions marked periods in his life where he would abstain from having companions at all, and on one occasion he even stopped having adventures or leaving
   the TARDIS
   , with little more than a
   cat
   for company.

  <p key="d2c20fd9-fe6f-4c21-82e0-097453e36296">
   When travelling without companions, the weight of being the last Time Lord became much more pronounced. If prodded too much, he would erupt in an often righteous sense of fury. Indeed, the Tenth Doctor was described by
   the Moment
   as "the man who regrets". The fact that he was instantly able to recall the number of
   Gallifreyan
   children that he believed were killed at the end the war indicated just how keenly he continually felt those horrendous memories.

   He met his eventual end after he absorbed a huge quantity of nuclear
   radiation
   whilst saving the life of Donna Noble's grandfather,
   Wilfred Mott
   . Delaying the process to visit all of his companions, the Doctor finally regenerated in the TARDIS, causing a huge amount of damage due to delaying the regeneration for as long as he did, and leaving

   Initially resigning himself to living with Reinette, the Doctor found a link back to the ship and his TARDIS through her old fireplace. The Doctor tried going back through the fireplace so that he could take Reinette to see the universe, but the loose connection to the time window meant she had already died when he returned. After reading a heartfelt letter she had left him, the Doctor was left devastated. (

   more technologically advanced than their Earth. While the TARDIS had died upon landing in the alternate universe, the Doctor managed to power a surviving piece of the TARDIS, but it required a twenty-four hour recharging cycle before the TARDIS could restore itself, giving the Doctor, Rose and Mickey time to explore the alternate Earth.

Together, the Doctor and Rose opened the Void and the Daleks and Cybermen were sucked in. The plan initially went smoothly, until Rose's lever malfunctioned, threatening to halt the operation. Rose secured the lever, but couldn't keep her grip and began to fall into the Void. She was saved at the last second by Pete and taken back across to the other universe, separating her from the Doctor. (

   In
   1930
   New York City
   , the Doctor and Martha investigated kidnappings from
   Hooverville
   , a community of people hit by the
   Great Depression
   with nowhere left to go, befriending their leader,
   Solomon
   . They also met
   Tallulah
   , in search of her boyfriend
   Laszlo
   , who had disappeared a few days prior. Investigating the sewers, the Doctor discovered
   Pig slaves
   that worked for the
   Cult of Skaro
   , who were kidnapping humans with high intelligence for their
   Final Experiment
   ; the pig slaves were created from those of low intellect. The group ran into Laszlo, and saw how the Daleks had partially transformed him into a pig slave, but he managed to escape with his mind still his own. The Doctor discovered that the Daleks were trying to evolve into new forms in order to survive, and the Cult of Skaro's leader,
   Dalek Sec
   , transformed himself into the first
   human-Dalek
   hybrid as part of this plan. (

   To the Doctor's surprise, Sec grew compassionate due to his new humanity, wishing to no longer conquer Earth, instead wanting the Doctor to take the new human-Dalek race to a new world in his TARDIS. However,
   Dalek Caan
   and the other members of the Cult betrayed Sec, stripped him of his authority, exterminated Solomon and continued with their mission to conquer Earth, filling the captive humans with pure Dalek DNA. The Doctor climbed to the top of the
   Empire State Building
   and got in the way of the solar flare that powered the experiment, adding Time Lord DNA to the hybrids.

   After Sec was killed by
   Dalek Thay
   in the defence of the Doctor, the Daleks fought the hybrids.
   Jast
   and Thay were killed in the battle and Caan deactivated the hybrids as failures, leaving himself the sole surviving Dalek. The Doctor attempted to negotiate with Caan, but the Dalek performed an
   emergency temporal shift
   and fled. Laszlo began to die due to the pig slaves' limited lifespan, but the Doctor, using the laboratory built by the Cult, cured his deterioration. However, he couldn't fix Laszlo's disfigurement, so he left him and Tallulah to live their lives in peace as new residents of Hooverville, where no one would judge Laszlo's appearance. (

   The Doctor brought Martha back home, exactly twelve hours after they left, planning to leave and continue his travels alone. However, he decided to stay after hearing that Professor
   Richard Lazarus
   was going to "change what it meant to be human". Attending Lazarus' demonstration, the Doctor met Martha's family, with her mother,
   Francine
   , taking an immediate dislike to him. The Doctor discovered Lazarus had created a machine to restore youth, similar to the

   Tish
   , from being drained by Lazarus by using
   his sonic screwdriver
   to enhance a pipe-organ to reverse the machine's effect and revert Lazarus to his original self, but not before Lazarus had fallen to his death. Per Martha's request, the Doctor took her on as his official travelling companion. (

The Doctor realigned the Shield's prismatic mirrors to refract a rainbow towards the Silhouettes, scaring them off. This caused the Sihouettes to flee, and the Great Solar Shield's crew were returned to Earth in the TARDIS. (

Due to his Time Lord nature having an inbuilt rejection towards Jack's "impossible existence", the Doctor set off immediately after the TARDIS was refuelled, but Jack managed to jump onto to the exterior of the TARDIS.

   After Martha returned to the UK, the Doctor was further aged into a diminutive body by the Master as a warning to Martha. When Martha allowed herself to be taken to the Master for execution, she and the Doctor revealed their plan; using the Archangel Network, the Doctor harnessed the psychic energy of humanity's hope, as Martha had spent a year travelling the world telling humanity about his importance to them, regaining his youthful appearance in the process. He then forgave the Master for everything he had done, inflicting a blow to the Master's ego. On the Doctor's orders, Jack destroyed the paradox machine keeping the Toclafane in the present, undoing the entire year; Earth was restored as time resumed for everyone else right after the President was killed, but those on the

   Whilst travelling alone, the Doctor became embroiled in the
   paradoxical timeline
   that a paradox triggered by his encounter with the Thirteenth Doctor in 1969 had created, where the
   Sea Devils
   now ruled Earth. He discovered an alternate version of
   Rose Tyler
   in
   2020
   , who was a resistance fighter opposing the Sea Devils, and persuaded her to come with him to correct the timeline. As he took the TARDIS back to the point of divergence, 1903, it collided with the Thirteenth Doctor's TARDIS which was making the same journey. The two Doctors stabilised their TARDISes and the Doctor and Rose boarded the future Doctor's TARDIS. The Tenth Doctor and Rose accompanied Team TARDIS and rogue
   Skithra Queen
   as they discovered that the
   Skithra
   had successfully captured
   Nikola Tesla
   and
   Thomas Edison
   and were attempting to awaken Sea Devils at the
   Raven Peninsula
   . After stopping them, the team infiltrated the Skithra ship to rescue the scientists, with the Tenth Doctor insisting he rescue them so he could meet them. He, Rose and the Thirteenth Doctor’s companions rescued them and returned to the TARDIS, where the Thirteenth Doctor revealed she and the Queen had successfully sabotaged the ship and dematerialised before it exploded. During the journey, the Tenth Doctor distracted Edison from the TARDIS by asking him basic questions about electricity. After the scientists were returned to Earth, the Tenth Doctor left with Rose in his own TARDIS.

   Hond
   , who the Doctor believed should have died out in the Dark Times, and requested his help. Reluctantly he agreed, believing the Hond could be a greater threat than the Daleks, and was sent to meet the
   Prime Strategist
   . He and the Strategist investigated the
   Vault of Obscenities
   and encountered a Hond, discovering a way to pacify them by ending their constant pain. The Doctor had the Daleks deploy this method as the Hond approached Skaro's defences and was successful, however a
   Grey Dalek
   turned on him and ordered his extermination. The Doctor was rescued by the Thirteenth Doctor who took him back to his TARDIS. Escaping Skaro, the two Doctors parted ways for good. (

   Rose warmed up to the Doctor's presence and after a while the two began to get along fine. Rose at one point asked the Doctor if he had ever had any other pets in the TARDIS, and the Doctor unveiled
   a personal version of K9
   that he had kept on the ship. Standard for most dogs and cats, Rose and K9 did not get along. Their first encounter ended with Rose attacking K9 with the sonic screwdriver and K9 entering "defence mode." The Doctor once again resulted to leaving the two dangling outside the ship as punishment.

   While walking together, Rose-the-cat suggested that the best option for getting over Rose Tyler was for the Doctor to get a "rebound companion". The Doctor was initially reluctant, but eventually agreed. However, on the night of his "blind date", he was apparently stood up and opted to return to the TARDIS, where his potential companion, a member of the
   Sisters of Plenitude

   Rose at some point was infected with
   fleas

   candy floss
   surrounded by a gas that was irresistible to insects. The Doctor placed Rose in the stuff and successfully cured her of her pestilence, but doing this also shaved most of the hair off of her lower body. In a "genius" solution, the Doctor put Rose in a miniature blue suit much like his own. While the Doctor and K9 were amused by the situation, Rose was not.

   Frustrated by how caught up he was over his now-ended relationship, Rose would spend a majority of her time on the ship trying to help the Doctor move on. The Doctor, meanwhile, found himself content in accepting his two pets as his new companions, and all that he needed. Rose and the Doctor eventually parted ways, with the Doctor deciding that it was about time to finally find a new companion. (

Whilst the Hand gloated, Majenta entered the Manus and used it to finally destroy the Crimson Hand, at the cost of her life. The Doctor jumped after the Manus as it withdrew to the Morass and used it resurrect her and place her in the restored New Old Detroit. With the Manus linked to his mind, as long as the Doctor remembered her she would stay alive. On good terms, the Doctor and Majenta parted. (

However, even with the Free Undead, the Doctors were unable to stop the Daleks' army of undead drones with Symbiont DNA, so prepared to collide the flagship with the saucer, in the hopes of the ensuing paradox wiping out the Daleks, but were prevented from doing so when Inyit used her final judgement to wipe out the Symbiont and the hybrids, ending the Daleks' assault as they panicked, fearing the judgement may spread to pure Dalek DNA, allowing the Eighth Doctor to sneak aboard with the aid of a Bloodsman. There, he used a remote detonator to trigger an explosive Brian had left in the saucer's engine room, forcing the saucer into the Time Vortex and away from the Dark Times. As they left the

The Doctors reflected that death would now spread entirely naturally and the Tenth Doctor agreed that, though he approved of the change, he had gone too far and would not rewrite history any further. After Brian decided to stay with the Free Undead, who were settling on Birinji, the Tenth Doctor departed the Dark Times alone. (

Time Marshal Barnes refused to listen to his pleas and had him arrested, however he quickly escaped and discovered the device they'd used to achieve the erasure, the Hourglass, which Barnes revealed was based on a Time Lord weapon, the "

She had him imprisoned again but feared he'd still manage to reverse her success and ordered his placement in a time lock. The Doctor appealed to the Hourglass, knowing it would have a conscience from the weapon it was based on, and it took him inside it's core where he could further modify it to get grant it more autonomy and reversed the erasure of L-10. As the reversal occurred, he confronted Barnes again and she ordered an Agent, Alison, to destroy the Hourglass before the reversal was complete. He convinced Alison to disobey and decided to name the galaxy after her. He then left with Alison to take her to guide the time travel experiments to avert disaster, warning Barnes that time always won and the Agency would likely disappear one day. (

While investigating in her retreat, Zhe's apprentice, in conflicting male and female forms, menaced the Doctor and Gabby before Zhe awakened from her stasis and pulled them into her, revealing they had been conflicting aspects of her personal psyche. Impressed by Gabby's skills in the crisis, the Doctor decided to allow her to be a full-time companion. (

   Returning to Brooklyn so Gabby could see her family, the Doctor discovered a mysterious increase in noise pollution throughout the city. He used the sonic screwdriver to
   deduce
   the noise increase was a cry for help from the
   Echoes
   , beings of living sound that were being hunted by
   Shreekers
   , who were enslaving them to harvest their energy for weaponry. Escaping back to the TARDIS on a moped, the Doctor and Gabby travelled to the
   Empire State Building

As it taunted Gabby, Gabby grabbed the screwdriver and used it to finish the calculations, destroying the Shreekers and their ship. The Echoes flew away, thanking Gabby for freeing them. (

   After he received a cloaked signal on his sonic screwdriver, the Doctor used the GPS on Gabby's phone to pinpoint the signal, and learnt it was from an auction in the city. While Gabby went to meet with her friend,
   Cindy Wu

   Cleopatra Hunsicker

The Doctor woke up to find that his and Vivian's ages had been restored, but Dorothy was dead. Vivian revealed that she was aware of the artefact's properties and had hoped to use it to preserve Dorothy's life. Dorothy's body, which was still connected to the artefact's power field, suddenly began levitating as Gabby and Cindy entered the apartment, having tracked the Doctor via Gabby's

The force, calling itself "the Seeker", detected Gabby and Dorothy and beamed them to the vessel as well, but then dispensed the Doctor and Cindy back on Earth. Cindy demanded that she be allowed to help, so the Doctor reluctantly agreed to take her to the TARDIS. They travelled to the Osiran mothership, which was where the vessel was located.

Erik, feeling betrayed from his beliefs, attacked Anubis, and the servants responded by killing Hanif. The Doctor healed Anubis of his injuries in a bid to make him see sense, but Anubis still planned on going through the gate. As the misalignment of the circle of transcendence and the mothership widened, the Doctor finally persuaded Anubis to delay his journey by reminding him he had defeated his father,
   Sutekh

Met with Voord soldiers, the Twelfth Doctor pretended to be his alternate self to gain authority, but a Voord soldier, believing the deception, connected the Twelfth Doctor to the Voord's group mind, while the Tenth Doctor and Gabby ran to the city's environmental unit. When the Twelfth Doctor found his alternate self to powerful to fight alone, he summoned the others to help him. Inside the group mind, the Tenth Doctor turned off the city's force field, threatening to wipe them out with acid lest he change the timeline, and the Eleventh Doctor reprogramed the dimensional controls to return the Voord to the main universe. After Clara apologised to him, the alternate Twelfth Doctor agreed and let history take its normal course, regressing the Voord and Marinus back to their primitive evolution. The deed done, the Tenth Doctor spoke his regret at taking the Voords' development from them, and the Eleventh Doctor said he would arrange for them to receive support and advice from the wider community of species.

Gabby and the bounty hunters, who had been captured and possessed by Ebonite, attacked them to gain their energy. The Doctor, however, managed to bring Gabby back to her senses by showing her the Shan'tee's musical portrait of her. With her remaining power, Gabby attacked Ebonite, causing him to activate an emergency scale change, revealing that they had been shrunken in a miniature environment beneath the Rockefeller Center. Ebonite split into multiple tiny clones, which ran off, vowing revenge. Munmeth decided that his remaining Neanderthal kind could live out in another world, and the Doctor suggested to Jack that he start a new group with Cleo and Erik's cult.

The Seeker explained that outside the shuttle only moments had passed since they were attacked, and while the team began to try and decode the situation, the Jade TARDIS grabbed Cindy with one of its tentacles and dematerialised.

McLinn discovered him  and had a Dalek guard him. Talking to it, the Doctor realised there was an organic creature inside and opened it’s casing to discover it was the mutated form of Arborecc, to his horror. He furiously confronted the Major on his return, declaring the project would end now, so McLinn decided to resort to having him mutated. The Doctor sabotaged the time engine used for mutation and rallied the fake Daleks against McLinn, so no-one else would suffer as they had.

Investigating the planet, the Doctor found out that Kamen had been pulling together the ships in the hope of finding his father; moreover, he also put tracking devices on the humans he saved, to prevent them from escaping. With the help of River and Anya, the Doctor was able to allow the escape of the humans, while leading Kamen Vers to overload his systems and explode. However, the Doctor and Anya remained trapped on the now desert Mto, where Daleks and Movellans were converging. River escaped using her

The Doctor was taken before the First Movellan just as Anya and Keelan infiltrated the rocket loaded with bombs from the

   Donna Noble
   and her grandfather,
   Wilfred Mott
   , something that would bring about "the end of time itself." He also learnt of a plot to
   resurrect
   the Saxon Master
   , and failed to stop it. The Doctor discovered the Master living in the wastelands of London. He tried to confront him, only for the Master to evade the Doctor when he reunited with Wilf. That night, the Doctor tracked down the Master once again, only for the Master to be abducted by
   Joshua Naismith
   's private army, and, when the Doctor attempted to stop them, he was knocked out.

   After he recovered, the Doctor contacted Wilf, who informed him of Naismith and went with him in the TARDIS to the Naismith Manor. In the Manor's basement, the Doctor used his sonic screwdriver to unveil two
   Vinvocci

   Addams
   and
   Rossiter

   After being taken prisoner, Wilf and the Doctor were rescued by the Vinvocci, who took them to their ship in Earth's orbit, which the Doctor took offline to stop the Master finding them. Realising the Master was planning to rescue the Time Lords from the Time War using a
   White-Point Star
   , the Doctor took the gun he initially refused from Wilf and piloted the Vinvocci ship back towards the Naismith Manor, where he crashed through the manor's glass roof. However, he was unable to stop the Master from using the star and

   Rassilon undid the Master's conversion of the human race, as Gallifrey appeared in the Earth's sky and began tearing open the Time Vortex. Torn between killing the Master or Rassilon in cold blood, the Doctor, upon seeing
   a familiar face

Rassilon tried to kill the Doctor out of spite, but the Doctor was saved by the Master, who attacked Rassilon with his energy blasts in vengeance, which resulted in the Master being sent back into the Time War with the Time Lords.

   With the Time Lords and the Master gone, the Doctor was relieved that he had survived his supposed death at Rassilon's hands, but his victory was short-lived when he heard the four knocks. They came from Wilf, who was trapped inside a radiation control booth which was about to be flooded with radiation. The Doctor quickly realised that the only way to save Wilf was to switch places with him, and be subjected to the radiation burst himself. At first angry about the terrible things the universe punished him with and nearly considering Wilf's pleas to leave him, the Doctor could not bear to sacrifice one life to prolong his own after going through so much to stop men willing to take the lives of millions to do the same. Determined, he released Wilf and received the fatal level of radiation. After the

   The Tenth Doctor's look is reminiscent of early
   19th century
   styles. In particular, Arnaud de Beaufort, painted by
   Pierre Paul Prud'hon
   around 1818, has almost the exact same look as
   David Tennant
   's Doctor, including his
   hair
   pulled forward in a messy style, the
   sideburns
   , and an
   overcoat
   for added presence. The main difference, really, is that the Tenth Doctor moves away from "stuffed shirt" with a plain
   shirt
   , a
   tie
   , and
   trainers
   .

  <p key="6fe7effa-0753-4dc2-ad7d-9ebece93f155">
   David Tennant described his costume "geek chic". According to an interview on

   , Tennant and
   Russell T Davies
   got the idea for the tenth incarnation's costume from an outfit Jamie Oliver had worn on

   just after Tennant had taken the role of the Doctor. According to
   <i key="8712815b-7717-45c2-a9cc-608e30131231">
    Doctor Who Confidential

   ,
   one of the first things Tennant said after deciding to take the part was "I want a coat down to

   According to
   costume designer
   Louise Page
   , there were only four sets of the brown suit in existence, as they were pieced together from many copies of a pin-striped pair of trousers that Tennant picked out during the initial costuming process. His overcoat was made from sofa covering and there was one version that had five inches from the bottom cut off then sewn back on, as Davies and
   Phil Collinson
   had different ideas about how long it should be.

   After leaving the series,
   David Tennant
   kept his costume for possible future use, stating that he would gladly return for a multi-Doctor special should he ever be asked to participate in one. (
