   The Master's Daleks conquered the altered universe. The triumphant Master visited Gallifrey and found the shockwave had left the planet home to simple farmers, who he deemed "quite pathetic". The parallel Master and Time Strategist began stoking the Master's paranoia that his Daleks would inevitably turn on him and eventually he was convinced to undo this timeline. The Master took them back in time to the moment he had decided to have Krazlus infiltrate the CIA, with the two Masters urging the younger Master to abandon his Anti-Genesis plan. The past Master was reluctant, however the Strategist simply exterminated Crazlus and all the events which had resulted from Crazlus' infiltration were undone. The Master fled in
   his TARDIS

During the campaign, Romana secretly negotiated with the Dalek Emperor to try and get him to stop the conflict as she knew that both sides would be utterly destroyed in the conflict, but failed to make it see reason.

    His TARDIS

   crashed into a
   Dalek time machine
   . The only reason he had crashed into the
   space-time vessel
   was because the timeship was designed to break time, as the ship itself was a temporal bomb, with the four Daleks aboard on a suicide mission to destroy Gallifrey's past, present, and future. When the crash occurred, it created four
   Kaleds
   who were temporal echoes of the Daleks aboard. "Pre-incarnations" of these four and the Dalek weapon were sent throughout time, which was what even led the Doctor to make these events happen.

   Speaking with the three surviving Kaleds after the death of
   Maran
   , which caused the death of her Dalek counterpart, the Doctor assumed the Dalek mission was revenge for the Time Lords mission to alter the
   creation of the Daleks
   , though he then recalled learning of a war. However, it remained "outside of [his] understanding." In order to save Gallifrey's timeline, thus protecting the Doctor from being erased from history, the three Kaleds then sacrificed themselves by confronting their Dalek counterparts, with each extermination resulting in the death of each Dalek as well. The Doctor and the Kaleds believed their destruction would leave the rest of the Dalek Empire without any understanding as to how the mission failed, meaning they would never try the strategy again. The Fifth Doctor then departed from the Time War, still not truly certain on the context for the events that had just taken place. (

After Tamasan’s contact was erased from history, they completed her orders by making contact with a squad of Gallifreyan special forces who had been raised in secret on the planet to fight the Dalek presence there, which was using a time eradicator to assassinate soldiers vital to Dalek losses, turning the tide of recent battles. The Doctor used himself as a distraction to enable the squad to find the Dalek base and discovered the eradicator was one of the Strategist’s engineers, now existing as part of the Vortex and able to see possible timelines.

   As the squad took the base, Tamasan made herself crucial to their victory by destroying the Time Strategist so the eradicator Dalek travelled back to assassinate her earlier in the mission. The Doctor and the squad’s commander followed it and foiled the assassination. The Doctor ripped off the eradicator’s Vortex anchor, causing it to be pulled fully into the Vortex and erased from history, undoing the Daleks’ recent assassinations. In doing so the Doctor also negated the recent battle on Atherea, restoring the Strategist which he resolved to try to kill again. (

   Loshann

When the Sisterhood were struck by a stream of pure chaos, several Loshann were open to be hit by the Mortlontoa's spores, which quickly inverted and corrupted them into attacking monsters. To save themselves and the surviving Loshann, the Doctor had Fey to shoot each of the attackers, only the planet's fate to be sealed when his machine failed. As the spores saturated land around them, the Doctor ordered his allies back to his TARDIS. However, Fey went to save a child in the wreckage, only to be touched by the spores. Presuming Fey dead, the Doctor angrily departed with the Sisterhood. (

The incident occurred after there had been "silence on the front" for weeks and hope was beginning to return to Gallifrey. They mistakenly hoped the newest generation of Battle TARDISes had fought back the Daleks. The silence on the front had really been because of the Dalek search for the Nightmare Child. (

   devices into countless time zones, which would then become new fronts when the already thinly-spread Time Lords responded to try to hold back their foes. Yet the Daleks' mass-recruitment efforts belied the fact that they reciprocated the desperation felt by the Time Lords; as specifically pointed out by the Doctor, the Daleks' experiments that involved turning humans into Daleks to use as foot soldiers against the Time Lords indicated that the Daleks were no longer as concerned with racial purity as they once were. The Doctor also sardonically noted that it was unsurprising that the Daleks' had set aside their most fervent beliefs in order to win the War, given that their backs were also up against the wall. (

   ) when the Time War had been raging for four hundred years of linear time (though temporal war zones had left no era of history unscathed). It started with the War Doctor, who had been fighting in the Time War for a hundred years or more, leading the
   Fifth Time Lord Battle Fleet
   against the Daleks in the
   Tantalus Eye
   . They defeated the Daleks there but were soon wiped out by nearby
   Dalek stealth ships
   . The Doctor then crash-landed on a nearby planet,
   Moldox
   . Here, he met a Dalek hunter going by the name "
   Cinder
   ", an orphaned victim of the Time War at a very young age who survived the extermination of her family by hiding. She helped the Doctor infiltrate a Dalek base and uncover their plans; the Daleks planned to create a paradigm of
   Temporal Weapon Daleks
   , all of which were equipped with
   De-mat weapons
   that could erase their victims from history. Using the power of the Eye to make a massive Temporal Cannon as well, the Daleks planned to do the same to Gallifrey.
  </p>
  <p key="9871099f-f971-4ec4-981c-8a21abcdbc9c">
   The Doctor brought Cinder aboard his TARDIS en route to Gallifrey to warn the Time Lords of the Daleks' plan. Joined by Cinder, the Doctor spoke to Rassilon and the High Council of Time Lords in a meeting, where the Doctor castigated them for their failings and warned them about the Dalek operation. As suggested by the
   Castellan
   , Rassilon planned to detonate the
   Tear of Isha
   in the Tantalus Eye. Rassilon consulted
   Borusa
   on his plan, who told him it would succeed. However, it would have caused the destruction of many innocent lives. The Doctor opposed the plan, which made Rassilon throw both him and Cinder in a prison cell. Cinder was also kidnapped by the
   Lord Cardinal
   Karlax
   and the
   Castellan
   to receive a
   mind probe
   to back up the Doctor's claims that the Daleks were going to eliminate their world, horrifying the Castellan.
  </p>
  <p key="a1d1c3d1-ff5d-47d7-b9f1-6430c6505144">
   After finding out about the mind probe, with Cinder's help, the Doctor broke free of the prison. The Doctor took Cinder from the
   Capitol
   and took her to the
   Death Zone
   , where the two of them retaliated by kidnapping the immortalised Borusa from his imprisonment in the
   Dark Tower
   , before escaping Gallifrey with the Castellan's help. Under Rassilon's orders, Karlax pursued them with some help from the
   Celestial Intervention Agency
   to
   assassinate
   them. During the chase, the CIA and their Battle TARDISes were attacked by Dalek stealth ships, leaving Karlax the only survivor. When Karlax then tried to take over the TARDIS following his

    regeneration
   </a>
   , the Doctor dematerialised his ship, setting the controls so that Karlax would be left behind in the middle of the Dalek Eternity Circle. There, he faced extermination as retribution for what he had done.
  </p>
  <p key="232bda5b-9f99-4e36-a53b-6a535520fdc8">
   After considering using Borusa to resurrect Cinder, he decided it would be wrong to alter time in such a way, realising that Cinder would never want him to use their one chance at destroying the Dalek plot to save her life alone. Thus, he ordered Borusa to wipe out the Dalek presence from the Eye and end the Dalek plan, after which Borusa, who had endured all of his regenerations time and time again from the Eye's temporal energies, passed away. Once the Doctor had foiled Rassilon's plan to detonate the Tear of Isha and spared the lives Rassilon would have let die, Rassilon condemned the Doctor's actions and declared him an enemy of the Time Lords because of it. In honour of Cinder's death, the Doctor promised he would put an end to the War, declaring, "no more". (
