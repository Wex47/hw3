   ". He was prone to criticising those who he felt were naive or primitive compared to his intellect. Originally a very difficult and curmudgeonly person, the First Doctor matured from an apparent selfishness and became more inviting. His happier, kinder characteristics were fostered when he began to acquire an entourage of

   </a>
   in
   1963
   , where Susan was a student at
   Coal Hill School
   . He was forced to abruptly depart from Earth with Susan's teachers,
   Ian Chesterton
   and
   Barbara Wright
   , kidnapping them from their own time after they went to investigate their unusual pupil. After much travel with Ian and Barbara, he bade Susan farewell to allow her to live a happier life with
   David Campbell
   , a man with whom she had fallen in love.
  </p>
  <p key="a042a5e3-b17f-400b-a7a1-2c827ebbb47a">
   Following Susan's departure, the Doctor travelled for a short time with Ian and Barbara, before landing upon the planet
   Dido
   , where he invited a new travelling companion to join him,
   Vicki Pallister
   . She reminded him of Susan, and the Doctor saw her as a surrogate to fill her spot in his travels with Ian and Barbara. Later, during a confrontation with the
   <a href="Dalek.html" key="d9040e35-0754-444e-8d45-b2549743e0d9" title="Dalek">
    Daleks
   </a>
   , the Doctor used one of their
   time machines
   to return Ian and Barbara to their proper time - something he had been unable to manage with his TARDIS.
  </p>
  <p key="da555367-505c-4580-828b-baa9d777fc62">
   Soon after the departure of Ian and Barbara, the Doctor and Vicki had gained a new companion in
   Steven Taylor
   , with whom the Doctor had a relatively uneasy relationship. Vicki eventually left the Doctor's company as well, also after falling in love with a man,
   Troilus
   , whom she met in ancient
   Troy
   . After a lengthy fight with the Daleks, Steven soon became bitter towards the Doctor, blaming him for the deaths of their travelling companions
   Katarina
   and
   Sara Kingdom
   , but eventually forgave him. They were then joined by
   Dodo Chaplet
   . Ultimately, Steven decided to stay to help a civilisation they had encountered, while Dodo was later injured in an adventure and decided to remain home in her own time, while the Doctor found himself joined by
   Ben Jackson
   and
   Polly Wright
   , to whom he was much more kind; he hoped to prevent them from leaving as Steven had. At some point, the First Doctor, going by the name Dr. Who, also travelled with
   John
   and
   Gillian
   , his other grandchildren.

The Doctor got better when Rasputin grabbed the object and absorbed its knowledge of the future.

   Voord
   , and the Doctor and Barbara first risked drowning and then were captured by the Voord. The Doctor healed himself thanks to a
   self-induced coma
   , but the Voord thought he was dead and disposed of him. The Doctor became the leader of Hydra resistance, and was eventually able to think of a plan to destroy the Voord's main central power station. The Voord leader,
   Nebrin

   Tarlak
   , and the attack was eventally a success. Hydra was thus released, and the travellers could depart once again. (

With the Doctor resolved to find out what the Daleks were doing on Kembel and stop them, he and the others discovered a large landing bay with ships from the many outer galaxies and the

   Kirksen

However, Katarina opened the outer door of the ship, sending Kirksen and herself to their deaths in the vacuum of space. Shaken, the Doctor lamented that, while Katarina couldn't have understood what she was doing, he would always remember her as "one of the daughters of the gods".

   After landing on Earth, the Doctor, Steven and Bret went to see
   Daxtar

Suspecting him to be in league with Chen, Bret shot him. Believing they would be caught any moment, the Doctor and Steven escaped just as another SSS Agent,
   Sara Kingdom
   , arrived. Showing no mercy, she killed Bret before he had a chance to explain himself.

   Evading capture, the Doctor and Steven were pursued by Sara into an empty chamber were they all fell victim to a molecular dissemination experiment and were transmitted to the swampy planet
   Mira

After the Doctor found Steven and Sara, they travelled to a nearby cave for shelter and tried to persuade Sara about the Daleks' plot with Mavic Chen, with Steven also furious with Sara for killing Bret, who Sara admitted was her brother. Suddenly, the invisible inhabitants of Mira, the
   Visians
   , surrounded the cave, but a Dalek appeared and shot one of them dead, causing the other Visians to begin attacking the Daleks and, in the confusion, the travellers evaded capture, stole the Daleks' spaceship and escaped Mira. Upon their return to Kembel, the Doctor gave the Daleks a copy of the Taranium Core he had made on the way, and returned to the TARDIS.

   Robert

   his twin brother
   and unintentionally trapped it in a loop where it would perpetually visit different Christmases trying to fulfil Robert's wish to go back to before his brother died of leukaemia. When the now-adult Robert touched the Taranium Core and reverted to his original age, the Doctor used the unique circumstances of the current situation to subtly change history, using the
   fast return switch
   to take Robert back to the last Christmas so that he could take the place of his brother, the TARDIS crew then taking him to Mars so that he could see something incredible before his death. (

He, Steven and Sara saw the old men toiling inside the Clock, but, as they were trying to figure out what they were doing, they were captured by Space Security Service agents. The agents recognised Sara as one of their own, and took her to meet a superior officer for questioning. The Doctor and Steven managed to escape from their cell, and found a deserted monitor, which they used to search for information about their whereabouts. They discovered that they had landed in
   3999

Steven proposed to go looking for Sara, but the Doctor stopped him, as them being spotted by Chen and Bret could have disastrous consequences for the future. Instead, they went back to the Clock to sabotage it and escape in the confusion. However, they ended up being trapped inside it, since the machine fed on the hope of escape of its prisoners and their efforts to find a weak link in its construction. They were freed by Sara when she managed to destroy the Clock. (

   Going by the name "Dr. Who", the Doctor once more landed the TARDIS in an empty yard in
   1960s
   England, where it was found by his grandchildren,
   John
   and
   Gillian Who
   , who had been looking for their grandfather. They did not know him personally, but had been told he was "an inventor of some sort". The children entered the timeship, but, when John began fiddling with the ship's controls, he accidentally caused it to be transported to the
   30th century
   . There, the Doctor and his grandchildren saved the peaceful
   Thains
   from being enslaved by the
   Kleptons
   . Declining the offer to stay a little longer with the Thains, the Doctor set about trying to return his grandchildren home. (

   The TARDIS took them to

The Doctor's suspicion proved true when the gods turned out to be alien lifeforms, who existed by belief and gained power equal to the faith the humans held in them. Recognising the danger such creatures posed, the Doctor worked with the US military to weaken the faith of the gods' worshippers, and subsequently driving the gods away by dropping a dud bomb that everyone watching believed would harm the gods. The Doctor and Steven subsequently accepted their differences and departed in the TARDIS, taking Dodo as their new companion. (

Dodo and the Doctor became separated, with Dodo being taken in by a travelling troupe of actors, and the Doctor being held prisoner in the Bastille. They discovered that the history in which they had landed was an altered history, made by aliens whose curiosity made them rewrite history to the designs of a depressed
   Marquis de Sade

   glass avatar
   of the

   , who offered to trade the Captain for the Twelfth Doctor's deceased companion,
   Bill Potts
   . Now joined by his future self, the Doctor examined the interior of the spaceship, and realised that the glass avatar was based off of a real person due to being too asymmetrical. Managing to escape as the Twelfth Doctor's TARDIS was taken by the Testimony, the two Doctors, the Captain and Bill retreated to the First Doctor's TARDIS, where the Twelfth Doctor decided to visit "
   an old friend

   Pathweb
   . When the Doctors agreed that the Captain had to die at his allotted point in time, the Twelfth Doctor requested, much to the First Doctor's surprise, that they take him back, which was allowed by the Testimony.

   Returning the Captain to

   Lethbridge-Stewarts
   , as a favour. Hidden by a
   perception filter
   , the two Doctors watched as the Captain, now with no memory of having ever met them, prepared to meet his fate. Suddenly, Christmas carolling started up on both sides of the battlefield, and the Twelfth Doctor explained that he had adjusted the time frame by a couple of hours so that when time resumed for the Captain and
   his opponent
   , it would be the beginning of the
   Christmas Armistice
   . As the Twelfth Doctor explained the Armistice to the First Doctor, the Captain called for aid for his wounded opponent and the First Doctor realised that his future self maneuverered events to save both men's lives, and that that was "what it [meant] to be a Doctor of War." After watching the Armistice for a few hours, the First Doctor admitted that he felt ready to regenerate, but questioned his future self on his decision, with the Twelfth Doctor only answering that the First Doctor would have to find out "the long way round" before the First Doctor departed to his TARDIS.
