   , the Doctor was no longer chained down by guilt, becoming a less amiable character, as he no longer needed to cover the pain of what he thought was the extinction of the Time Lords, with a withdrawn attitude who habitually questioned his own goodness.

   78351

   Returning Clara to her date, the Doctor continued to follow his theory by trying to use a trace of Clara left in the telepathic circuits, ending up at the
   end of the universe
   where a time traveller named Colonel
   Orson Pink
   had been trapped for six months. Intrigued by how following Clara's timeline led him to Orson, the Doctor returned for Clara and had them wait at the end of the universe for the night, believing it to be the perfect time to find out if the creatures were real. Finding a chance to confront the creature outside the ship, the Doctor sent Clara into the TARDIS and seemed to get a look at what he'd been chasing before the atmospheric shell broke and Orson had to rescue him. As the Doctor was knocked out, and the TARDIS seemed to be under attack, Clara used the telepathic circuits to fly the TARDIS away. The Doctor woke up to find Clara gone, but, before he could investigate, Clara re-entered the TARDIS and made him promise to leave and not find out where they had landed. Afterwards, the Doctor returned Orson and Clara to their own times and, satisfied by what he had learned, underlined the

   Returning to pick up Clara, and persuade her to away from a date with Danny in favour of other travel destinations, the Doctor received a call from Madame
   Karabraxos
   , who requested he free
   the Teller
   and its mate from the
   Bank of Karabraxos
   , as he had done on the day she met him. Realising the ramifications of this request, the Doctor built up the identity of "the Architect", using this identity to stage a bank heist for him to commit, with the assistance of Clara, an
   augmented human
   named
   Psi
   , and a shape shifting
   mutant human
   named
   Saibra

   atomic shredders
   . Seemingly losing Saibra and Psi to the shredders when the Teller locked onto them, the Doctor figured out that time travel was involved with the heist plan when a perfectly-timed
   solar storm
   unlocked the Bank's vault. Retrieving what the Architect had promised Psi and Saibra as payment, the Doctor and Clara were caught by the Teller and delivered to the bank manager, Ms.
   Delphox

   Venturing into the Bank's private vault to find his and Clara's reward, the Doctor instead found Director Karabraxos, and discovered that Delphox, as well as a majority of the bank's staff, was an exact clone of Karabraxos. Seeing Karabraxos' hatred of her own clones caused the Doctor to have an epiphany on the identity of the Architect, and he gave his phone number to Karabraxos as she fled from the solar storm about to hit the Bank. Subjecting himself to the Teller's powers, the Doctor regained his lost memories and realised the true objective of the bank heist. Freeing the Teller and its mate to a place to live in solitude, the Doctor then parted ways with Psi and Saibra, giving them their rewards, and returned Clara home for her date. (

Scanning the Moon's core, the Doctor discovered that the Moon was, in fact, an egg for an ancient creature that was hatching. Reuniting with Clara and Lundvik after the shuttle and the TARDIS fell into a canyon, the Doctor informed them of his discovery after establishing contact with Courtney's phone. While Clara and Lundvik argued about killing the creature for the sake of the Earth, the Doctor had Courtney bring the TARDIS to him via a DVD, deciding that it was not his place to decide the Moon's future, and left in his TARDIS for Clara, Lundvik and Courtney to decide on behalf of humankind.

Tired of the Doctor's apathy, Clara argued with the Doctor about how he had almost caused her to kill an unborn creature, and, deeply hurt by the Doctor's constantly patronising attitude toward humanity in general, she told him to leave and not return for her.

   an elderly passenger
   , and urging himself to investigate, the Doctor went to the engine room to examine the dead passenger's
   Excelsior Life Extender
   , meeting
   Chief Engineer Perkins
   in the process, and learned the legend of the

   Confronting Captain
   Hector Quell
   with his theory, but getting ignored, the Doctor joined Perkins and Moorhouse in the engine room to research the deaths. Calling Clara to update her, the Doctor discovered that she and
   Maisie Pitt
   were trapped in a storage cart with a sarcophagus. Fearing that Clara was trapped with the Foretold, the Doctor tried to rewire the door open, only to find the sarcophagus empty, and himself under arrest by Quell for being a stowaway. However, after witnessing a third death first hand, Quell realised that the Doctor was right and allied with him, just as the Doctor
   deduced
   the true nature of the Orient Express; the passengers were all experts and scientists in specific fields of study, gathered there to study the Foretold. With a lab revealed and the hologram passengers disappearing, the train's computer,
   Gus
   , gave the scientists the necessary instructions and equipment. Losing Moorhouse to the Foretold, the Doctor and Perkins figured out that the Foretold was targeting the weaker passengers after looking at the medical history of the previous victims, just as Quell was killed by the creature, as he had
   post-traumatic stress
   , but not before he gave the Doctor the necessary description to defeat the Foretold.

   Realising that Maisie was next due to her breakdowns, the Doctor told a reluctant Clara to bring Maisie to the lab, where the Foretold appeared to Maisie, but the Doctor saved her by implanting a replica of her grief into his head, confusing the Foretold into thinking the Doctor was Maisie. Deducing that the Foretold was an ancient soldier augmented with technology, the Doctor surrendered, and, after a final salute, the ancient soldier crumpled to dust, with only the technology that kept him alive remaining. With the objective completed, Gus released the air out of the cabin, but the Doctor beamed all the dying passengers into the TARDIS, and tried to hack Gus to find out who had created him, but this trigged a security measure, causing the train to self-destruct. Dropping everyone but Clara and Perkins off at the nearest civilised planet, the Doctor waited for Clara to awaken on a beach before explaining everything.

   Back in the TARDIS, the Doctor invited Perkins to travel with him, but Perkins politely declined and he and the Doctor bade each other goodbye. Reflecting on a conversation she had with Maisie, Clara, having forgiven the Doctor, decided to continue travelling with him, telling the Doctor that her leaving was all Danny's idea. (

   Following Clara's request to meet the Greek storyteller
   Homer
   , the Doctor found himself drugged by an innkeeper and bound to a post with Homer and Clara to be fed to a bunch of
   Cyclopes
   . Before he could be eaten, however, the Doctor managed to convince the Cyclopes to listen to Homer's harp, and the young man's music soothed the hungry Cyclopes to sleep. Using a
   sub-conscience reading reality device
   , the Doctor discovered that the beasts were refugees from a war that had destroyed their world and, after using his device to convert them to a vegetarian diet, the Doctor let Clara convince them to live in peace in the hills. (

   Maebh Arden
   , a student of
   Coal Hill Year 8 Gifted and Talented Group
   under Clara and Danny's care, found the TARDIS. With his theories constantly being proven wrong, the Doctor came to the conclusion that the trees' sudden overgrowth was an act of aggression, while also dealing with Clara's students in his TARDIS after Clara and Danny arrived to collect Maebh, only for Maebh to slip away in the commotion, just as the Doctor noticed her homework had predicted the events of that day. Following Maebh deeper into the forest, the Doctor discovered that a sentience identifying itself as "the life that prevail[ed]" had caused the overgrowth, in preparation for a devastating
   solar flare
   about to hit the Earth. Believing Earth doomed, Clara inquired him to use the TARDIS as a lifeboat, only to inform him that she had said that to get him back to his TARDIS so he could survive the catastrophe alone. Despite some reluctance, Clara eventually convinced him to leave.

With Danny taking the children to their homes, the Doctor and Clara watched the trees that had grown around the world harvesting and extinguishing the solar fire in the TARDIS, and then returned to watch the trees disappear on Clara's balcony.

However, reflecting on his past, the Doctor realised that he was just a man in a box who travelled around to help where he could, and then turned command of the army over to Danny, who led the Cybermen into the clouds, where they self-destructed and stopped the rainfall from converting the living.

As the web began collapsing, the Doctor and Clara escaped to the TARDIS as Weir held off the Hyperions.

   Supreme Dalek
   in confirmation of her demise, the Doctor was restrained by Colony Sarff and brought back to Davros's infirmary, where Davros revealed that he was able to sustain his life by siphoning off the Daleks' heartbeats through his life support system, and offered to give the Doctor control of this to commit unprovoked
   genocide
   upon the Daleks. Though tempted, the Doctor chose to be compassioned and refused to act, taking the opportunity retrieve his
   sonic sunglasses

   Fully convinced that Davros was truly dying when the Kaled scientist looked upon him with his real eyes, the Doctor decided to give Davros his last wish of seeing the sunlight with his true eyes one last time. When Davros could no long keep his eyes open by the time the sun rose, the Doctor proceeded to give Davros a bit of regenerative energy, but was seized by Colony Sarff and drained to regenerate Davros and all the Daleks on Skaro. He was saved when Missy killed Sarff, and revealed to Davros that he had guessed his plan all along and had tricked Davros; the regenerative energy Davros had used to renew himself and his creations had also been distributed through the sewers beneath the city, and the decaying remains of the ancient Daleks they contained had awoken and begun to emerge. While fleeing the city, the Doctor and Missy came across a Dalek that Missy claimed had killed Clara. The Doctor demanded the Dalek tell him if this was true, but the Dalek kept babbling incoherently. When it began to beg for mercy, the Doctor, suspicious, demanded it open its casing, and found that Clara had been trapped inside the Dalek by Missy, and the Doctor told her to run as he freed Clara.

   Cass
   ,
   Tim Lunn
   ,
   Alice O'Donnell
   ,
   Mason Bennett
   and
   Richard Pritchard

   Jonathan Moran

   Trapping the ghosts in the Faraday cage, the Doctor found they were repeating coordinates to the flooded town's church, and that the ghosts had been artificially created to act as a homing beacon. After Bennett retrieved the ship's suspended animation chamber, the Doctor found that the coordinates had been the symbols within the spaceship, and decided to go back in time to before the town's flooding to find the truth of the matter. As the Doctor, Clara and the crew made their way to the TARDIS, the ghosts began flooding water into the Drum, resulting in emergency doors coming down and splitting the group in half. Clara was trapped in the base with Cass and Lunn, while the Doctor set off in the TARDIS with O'Donnell and Bennett. (

   Fisher King
   . Wanting to destroy the signal, the Doctor demanded Prentis hand over the device broadcasting, but Prentis was oblivious to what the Doctor was talking about. Contacting Clara, the Doctor found that a ghost of himself had appeared in 2119, mouthing the names of the dead and those yet to die, with Clara second after O'Donnell. The Doctor was shaken at the prospect of him dying, but, despite Clara's urging to change time, he insisted he had to die. The Doctor's ghost then entered the Drum and released the other ghosts, forcing Clara, Cass and Lunn back to the Faraday Cage, where the phone signal was cut off. Before they left, however, the Doctor was able to get a look at his ghost and see him change his message.

   Realising O'Donnell was going to die, the Doctor and Bennett tried to persuade her to stay in the TARDIS, but she refused. Returning to the ship, the trio found Prentis dead, the writing written and themselves being hunted by the Fisher King. Pursued into a building, O'Donnell was separated from the group and killed by the Fisher King, fulfilling the Ghost Doctor's prophecy. The Doctor and Bennett then tried to go back to the future to save Clara from being killed, but the TARDIS instead sent them back in time by thirty minutes, where the Doctor had to force Bennett from interfering in Prentis and O'Donnell's deaths. Sending Bennett back to the TARDIS, the Doctor set one of the ship's power cells to destroy the dam above the town. Confronting the Fisher King, the Doctor was informed that the ghosts were signalling to the Fisher King's armada to rescue him and enslave the Earth. Just as he was about to be shot, the Doctor lied about erasing the writing from the ship, provoking the Fisher King to return to the ship, just as the power cell exploded, wrecking the dam wall and flooding the town. Before the flood hit the church, the Doctor got into the Fisher King's stasis chamber, protecting him as the Fisher King drowned in the flood. (

   After saving the
   Velosians
   from being attacked by "four and a bit battle fleets" and rescuing Clara from being killed by a
   Love Sprite
   from the
   Spider Mines
   , the Doctor and Clara landed on Earth, where they were promptly captured by
   Vikings
   and taken to their village on a two days'
   longboat
   journey from the TARDIS. When a race called the
   Mire
   attacked the village, killing all of the warriors, a girl named
   Ashildr
   declared war between the village and the Mire. After failing to train the farmers in the village to fight, the Doctor realised the village farmed
   electric eels
   , enabling him to formulate a plan to defeat the Mire.
  </p>
  <p key="6579ee53-e8b9-42c4-ba2f-f5f68bddc2d6">
   When the Mire arrived, the Doctor and the farmers distracted them with a party in a barn, while the other villagers used the eels to electrocute four of the Mire and remove their armour and weapons. Seizing the opportunity, the Doctor gave one of the helmets to Ashildr, who used it to feed the image of a dragon into the technology of the Mire's helmets, scaring them off, when the dragon was actually nothing more than a puppet. The Doctor revealed to
   the Mire leader
   that Clara had filmed them being scared away by the villagers and threatened him and to leave lest the video be released to the
   Galactic Hub
   and ruin the Mire's reputation. The Mire promptly left, but the celebrations ended when it was discovered that Ashildr had died of
   heart failure
   as a result of using the Mire helmet.

   The Doctor moped in a barn, regretting being unable to save Ashildr. However, after voicing his pain to Clara, he realised that he shared the face of
   Lobus Caecilius
   , whom he had saved from a fixed point in time during his
   tenth incarnation
   , and concluded that his face was a reminder to himself that he should always save people. Using a Mire
   repair kit
   from the Mire helmet, the Doctor revived Ashildr, and left her a second kit for whoever she wanted. Heading back to the TARDIS, the Doctor, now reflecting poorly on his actions, told Clara that the kit would have given Ashildr immortality, and then realised that he had also made her a hybrid. (

   to

   England

The Doctor's intervention resulted in the carriage escaping before either of them could get the Eyes, and the Knightmare revealed herself to be Ashildr, who was now addressing herself as "Me" after losing most of her childhood memories due to her long lifespan. At "Lady Me's" mansion, Ashildr told the Doctor of her exploits, and begged him to take her with him in the TARDIS, but he refused. Instead, the two teamed up to steal the Eyes of Hades from

   Sam Swift
   was to be executed, Ashildr and Leandro set off to use his death to activate the artefact. While the Doctor tried to call off Swift's execution, Ashildr forcibly attached the Eyes of Hades to Swift, opening the portal. Leandro then revealed that he had only used Ashildr to get the portal open and allow his people to invade, and the
   Leonian
   ships began attacking the peasants. Realising her mistake, Ashildr used the second Mire kit to revive Swift, closing the portal and ending the attack. For his failure, Leandro was incinerated by his people. In the aftermath, Ashildr accepted her inability to travel with the Doctor and told him she would look out for other people he left behind, and they parted on relatively good terms

The Doctor then realised that the sleep dust in the air was being used as cameras to store images of the rescue mission, and that Rassmussen was behind the entire thing. Going to the crew's rescue ship, the Doctor, Clara and Nagata found Rassmussen had plans to spread the Sandmen to other planets. Surviving Rassmussen's attempt to kill them with his

Ashildr apologised for the harm she had done, but the Doctor, honouring his promise to Clara, warned her to keep out of his way. The teleport bracelet then activated, teleporting the Doctor away to its destination. (

   the Hybrid
   . Meeting with the General and the
   Sisterhood of Karn

   Extraction chamber 7

   extraction chamber

   With Clara still frozen, the Doctor took her to the last minutes of the universe, believing that her time would reset and she would become alive again. With Clara still frozen, a knock sounded on the TARDIS doors and the Doctor found it was Ashildr, still alive at the end of the universe. The Doctor and Ashildr shared theories on the Hybrid; the Doctor believing it to be Ashildr, while she believed the Hybrid to be either the Doctor himself, or the combined forces of the Doctor and Clara. The Doctor, denying Ashildr's claims, told her that he planned to erase Clara's memory of him to protect her from the Time Lords, but Clara had spied on their conversation and reversed the polarity of the neural block with the sonic sunglasses. After learning of what Clara did, the Doctor still decided to use the device, only for it to backfire on him, causing him to lose his memories of who Clara was and collapse.

   The Doctor eventually awoke in the

   a man
   told him that Clara had asked him to look after the Doctor. Having forgotten Clara's face, but still having impressions of his time with her, the Doctor made his way to a diner in the desert, where he encountered a waitress. The Doctor told the waitress his story while playing
   a song he composed for Clara
   . After his story ended, the waitress exited through a door, and the diner dematerialised, revealing to the Doctor that it had been the stolen TARDIS. Now outside, the Doctor found his own TARDIS, with a mural dedicated to Clara on it, whom the Doctor recognised as the waitress. Receiving a new sonic screwdriver from the TARDIS, and a final message of encouragement from Clara scrawled on one of the TARDIS' blackboards, the Doctor took off for new adventures on his own, with the mural unravelling as he dematerialised.

Escaping imprisonment, the group returned to the surface, where Jakob declared that the Foxkin had to be destroyed, but the Doctor revealed he had worked out that Jakob had purposefully killed Idra to stop her from revealing the Foxkin, due to his hatred of the creatures and Idra's desire to broker peace. Jakob fled, and was eventually arrested by the authorities. The Doctor and Hattie held a concert to encourage the humans of the Twist to accept and welcome the Foxkin into their society.

   The Doctor determined that an item Holly brought at the antiques fair was a TARDIS shell, which was dying and leaking arton energy, causing its dimensions to spill into the house and potentially across the whole universe. After finding Holly's family, they were directed to the control room of the TARDIS. Hattie and her family fought off an attack from the Spyrillites as the Doctor programmed the TARDIS to send it to die in the heart of a star, restoring the house to normal. After another jamming session aboard his TARDIS, the Doctor returned Hattie back to her home on the Twist. (

   Jess Collins

   London Underground
   , where Jess' father,
   Lloyd
   , worked, Jess followed him to investigate the signal. In the tunnels, they were caught by Lloyd and then attacked by a skeletal
   bird creature
   , but the Doctor disabled the creature with
   electricity
   from the Underground, noting it was an animated cadaver. Lloyd, injured by the creature, was taken to hospital, where the Doctor scanned him and realised he had an unidentifiable bacterial infection. Returning to the Underground with Jess, the Doctor found a telepathic node on the creature's body, which explained that the creature was an alien called
   Moan'na
   , who had fled his kind and disguised himself as a human in
   17th century
   London. The Doctor determined that Moan'na had died of the
   bubonic plague

   The Doctor and Jess returned to the hospital and found Lloyd had mutated into a creature like Moan'na, who knocked the Doctor out and took Jess away. Upon awakening, the Doctor and Jess' mother,
   Devina
   , pursued them to
   Brixton
   , as the infection began mutating more people. The Doctor used the telepathic node to allow Jess and Devina to communicate with Lloyd and break the infection's control over his mind, which, in conjunction with the TARDIS' telepathic circuits, rewrote the
   DNA
   infections to change Lloyd and the infected back to normal. However, the the TARDIS' systems overloaded and caused it to retreat within itself. The Collins family invited the Doctor to stay with them while the TARDIS recovered. (

The Doctor fled to the TARDIS and took Julie with him, knowing that there were mysterious forces at work. The Doctor and Julie went to the Bibliotheque Mazarine library to find information on the forces, with the Doctor using his psychic paper to get the library's curator, Bishop Mazarin, to tell him that Richelieu had created an intelligence network called the Cabinet Noir to intercept the mail of Paris and instructed Mazarin to build a secret library to store confiscated mail, and that Richelieu had experimented with magic and opened a realm of beings, which granted him the ability to not age. Mazarin gave the Doctor the keys to the secret library and told him that Richelieu was plotting to create another portal to plunge the entire world into darkness, but he was suddenly killed by gargoyles before he could say anymore. The gargoyles attacked the Doctor, but Julie managed to destroy the head of one, revealing them to be robots, as the Doctor looked at a chart in the secret library and found an astrological prediction that predicted an eclipse, which the darkness planned to use for their invasion.

Julie was separated from the Doctor and imprisoned to be executed during the king's festival, but the Doctor freed Julie by posing as her executioner. The eclipse began, and the darkness started to emerge and attack. The Doctor used the sonic screwdriver and TARDIS to open a portal into the Ssabrehagen Quaser to spread light across the land, destroying Richelieu and the darkness. Julie asked the Doctor if she could join him in the TARDIS, but he declined. The two instead decided to finish their sword duel. (

However, River intended to remove Hydroflax's head, and managed to steal it when Hydroflax, whose head was dispensable, discovered the ruse and tried to kill her and the Doctor, until the Doctor took his head hostage and, with the robotic body unwilling to potentially harm Hydroflax's head, the Doctor and River managed to get teleported out by

   large fish-like creature

Leaving Bill and the urchins to clear the River of people, the Doctor moved the explosives towards the creature's chains, freeing it when Sutcliffe activated the dynamite. As the ice shattered from the creature's escape, killing Sutcliffe, the Doctor rescued Bill by pulling her off of the ice before they got soaked as the sea creature passed them by. After amending Sutcliffe's will to name

Bill took a photograph on her phone which revealed Sashana's true form, and Sashana revealed that Matildus had no granddaughter, that she was psychically sowing doubt in Matildus' mind and was blocking her memories so she could sell off the library's collection. Sashana began to fry the group's brains with her mind, but was stopped after Bill summoned the

   After a pyramid appeared in
   Turmezistan
   , the Doctor, as the
   President of Earth
   , was called upon to deal with the situation by the
   Secretary General of the United Nations
   . At the pyramid, the Doctor, Bill, Nardole, the Secretary General,
   US
   Colonel
   Don Brabbit
   ,
   Russian
   official
   Ilya Svyatoslavovich
   and
   China
   official
   Xiaolian
   were shown a vision of an apocalyptic Earth by the
   Monks
   , who demanded the Earth surrender to them out of love so they could prevent that future from happening. The Doctor refused to, but the Secretary General took the offer out of fear, and was killed for giving the wrong consent.

   Setting out to determine the cause of the world ending threat, the Doctor came to the conclusion that they were dealing with a
   bacteria
   that would be accidentally released soon. Hacking the CCTV cameras of all the labs on the world to see which one the Monks would reactivate, the Doctor and Nardole went to
   Agrofuel Research Operations
   to prevent the catastrophe, while Bill, Brabbit, Svyatoslavovich and Xiaolian went to negotiate with the Monks. At the lab, after ordering Nardole to move the TARDIS and get himself to safety from the bacteria, the Doctor learned from
   Erica
   that a misplaced decimal point had resulted in the creation of the deadly bacteria. With the lab's automatic vent systems primed to send the bacteria into the atmosphere in a short time, the Doctor rigged an explosion to sterilize the lab and destroy the bacteria before it could be released.

   However, the Doctor became trapped in the part of the lab about to be destroyed when his
   sonic sunglasses
   couldn't read the combination lock to the lab door. With Nardole not responding, the Doctor admitted he was blind to Bill and, though he was prepared to die for his mistake, Bill, as the last remaining representative, surrendered Earth to the Monks in exchange for them restoring the Doctor's vision, telling the Doctor the Earth needed him too much. With his vision returned, the Doctor escaped the lab, but was telepathically told by the Monks that he would only "see [their] world." (

   After six months of the Monks' rule, and on Nardole's suggestion, the Doctor had him bring Bill to him, but not without making sure the Monks weren't affecting her. Once Nardole had brought Bill to the prison boat, the Doctor acted as if he was truly working with the Monks, and sent in his guards to hold Bill at gunpoint, having already told his guards to use
   blanks
   to avoid a fatality. When his manipulations caused Bill to grab a pistol and shoot him, the Doctor faked a regeneration to completely fool Bill, admitting to the test after he ended the regeneration effect. Knowing that
   Missy
   would have information on the Monks, the Doctor and his companions stole the prison boat to sail to

   the Vault
   to converse with Missy, who revealed that the only known way to stop the Monks was to kill their "lynchpin", not knowing that this was Bill. The Doctor refused to sacrifice Bill and instead set out to the Monks' headquarters in

   , the Doctor was unable to overpower the Giant Monk, and was restrained by Bill and Nardole to prevent him stopping Bill sacrificing herself, but she was able to survive by thinking of her mother, with a memory "so pristine" that it managed to break the Monks' conditioning. With humanity starting to realise the false history of the Monks, the Monks chose to flee the planet, erasing all memory of themselves as they did so. With everything returning to normal, the Doctor returned to the Vault, where he listened as Missy revealed she was starting to feel guilt for the lives she had taken in the past. (

The Doctor examined the Glass Woman with the First Doctor, who realised that the Glass Woman was based on a real person and, at the prompting of Bill, the Twelfth Doctor chose to flee. Lowering the winch holding the TARDIS, the Doctor was able to escape the spaceship with Bill, the Captain and his first incarnation, who lead everyone to his TARDIS. The Twelfth Doctor, knowing that their best chance of stopping Glass Woman was to discover who she was, and that the First Doctor's TARDIS databanks were incomplete, decided to visit his "old friend"

After getting Rusty to scan him and see that he was already dying, Rusty stopped and allowed the Twelfth Doctor to enter his tower. Leaving the First Doctor behind for his own protection, the Doctor greeted Rusty in the tower, and negotiated with him for access to the Daleks'
   Pathweb

Knowing they were to blame, the Twelfth Doctor requested for him and the First Doctor to be the ones to return the Captain to
   1914

   regeneration energy

As his first incarnation departed, the Doctor, briefly rendered visible, saluted the Captain, a salute he returned with confusion. (
