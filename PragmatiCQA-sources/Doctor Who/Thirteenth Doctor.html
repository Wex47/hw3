   , who was found and adopted by
   Tecteun
   . After a series of experiments, the
   First Tecteun
   passed on the ability to regenerate to her own people, the
   Shobogans
   , who later discovered the ability to
   time travel

   . The Doctor learned that she had been inducted into
   the Division
   , a secretive organisation founded on Gallifrey, and that they had taken these
   memories
   from her, as well as turning her back into

   The Doctor spent some time imprisoned by the
   Judoon
   , rethinking her identity, before eventually reuniting with her friends with the help of
   Jack Harkness
   . However, ten months had passed on Earth, and much had changed without her. After
   defeating

   together, Ryan and Graham left the TARDIS to resume their lives on Earth. The Doctor continued travelling with Yaz by her side, as co-pilot, who was now fully immersed into the Doctor's world. She also continued to investigate her lost past, pursuing the last surviving member of the Division,
   Karvanista
   .

   later joined them as they faced an existential threat like no other:
   the Flux
   , a force which would take apart the very structure of the cosmos, bringing about the
   end of everything
   . The Doctor was reunited with a new incarnation of
   Tecteun
   , who informed her that the Division was behind the Flux, making and placing it in an attempt to destroy a "virus" they had let into their "experiment" - none other than the Doctor herself. After the crisis had been resolved, and a war for control of the remaining
   universe
   between the
   Dalek War Fleet
   ,
   Cyber-Fleet
   and
   Sontaran Empire
   ended in mutual destruction during the final Flux event, she met the
   Eternal
   embodiment of
   Time
   , who warned her of her looming final fate.

   Seeking the Doctor out in revenge for the destruction of their fleet,
   Dalek Executioners
   pursued the TARDIS to
   ELF Storage
   , where it was rebooting after damage sustained from the
   Great Disruption
   . Unknowingly, however, the TARDIS had trapped the inhabitants of the building in a
   time loop
   whilst it rebooted, and any time one of them
   died
   , they found themselves reset a
   minute
   later than the last loop. Finally defeating the Daleks once and for all in an explosion of
   fireworks
   with the help of
   Sarah
   and
   Nick
   , the Doctor and her companions broke the time loop and returned to a fully repaired TARDIS. They then encountered the
   Sea Devils
   and afterwards the Doctor and Yaz talked over their feelings for each other.

The trio were lured to a pier, where they reunited with Yaz and Graham, so Shui and Bruce could duel for the fate of the planet. Bruce ultimately prevailed after the Doctor advised him to move the fight to the shore, forcing the Kalatra to withdraw, taking Chen and Shui with them. Afterwards Team TARDIS spent some days in Bruce’s company before departing. (

   Forced to accompany him to Gallifrey to prevent him killing her friends, the Doctor was placed in
   the Matrix
   by the Master, where she learnt that she was the
   Timeless Child
   , an entity who had the ability to regenerate indefinitely and whom the early Time Lords had experimented on and studied to gain the ability themselves. The Doctor managed to escape from the Matrix by overloading it with her memories, and was reunited with her friends, Ko Sharmus and the refugees. Together, they destroyed the
   Cybercarrier
   that had landed on Gallifrey and retreated to
   a vacant TARDIS

Unable to dematerialise, she piloted the TARDIS towards Earth and warned Karvanista that the Flux had arrived early, guiding his people's fleet to form a shell to protect Earth.

   The Doctors near Earth learnt that the Sontarans had invaded again and both sought to investigate. The Doctor with her companions followed Kate Stewart's suggestion to plant agents in the Sontarans' experiments on human psychics, using her TARDIS to recruit Claire from 1967 at Jericho's request. The Doctor with Karvanista and Bel deliberately got them captured by the Sontarans to get information. Whilst being held with Karvanista, she asked him about their past and he confirmed he'd once been her companion. The imprisoned Doctor was interrogated by the
   Grand Serpent
   until the Doctor with her companions rescued her and Karvanista. Together the two Doctors discovered the Sontarans' plan to lure Daleks and Cybermen fleets to the Flux event, which they were learning the starting point of via the psychics, in hopes their combined matter would resolve the Flux. They also used the TARDIS to rescue Vinder and
   Diane
   from Swarm and Azure's Passenger. The two Doctors sabotaged the Sontarans' plan by helping Karvanista regain control of the Lupari fleet, after the Sontarans had stolen them, changing their formation so the Sontaran fleet perished with the Daleks and Cybermen, however this proved insufficent to stop the Flux. Following a suggestion by Diane, the Doctors summoned the Passenger whose endless matter proved sufficient.

   The third Doctor was taken to the Temple of Atropos by Swarm and Azure, who planned to offer her to
   Time
   upon the Temple's destruction by the Flux.
   An embodiment of Time
   appeared before them and dismissed the Ravagers after revealing their Flux had failed. To her surprise Time left the Doctor alone, instead bringing her three aspects back together and giving her hints of her looming fate. The Doctor was then returned to the TARDIS, having recovered the Chameleon Arch from Swarm's remains. She subsequently left Bel and Vinder with Karvanista, returned Claire home and then invited Dan to continue travelling with her and Yaz. As Yaz showed Dan around, the Doctor placed the Chameleon Arch inside the console and asked the TARDIS to hide it from her, unless she really asked for it. (
