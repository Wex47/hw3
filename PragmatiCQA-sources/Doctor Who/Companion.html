   The term "companion" is used more outside the programme — which is to say in

   — than within the narrative. It was especially rarely used in the original version of the television programme. While the

   the TARDIS

   Liz Shaw
   isn't a companion, despite being the clear co-star of

   This question can be expanded to the literally hundreds of characters depicted on TV, in comic strips and in literature who over the years have filled companion-like roles in one-off stories as they encountered the Doctor. Indeed some of these characters have been promoted to ersatz companion status. For a time,
   Henry Gordon Jago
   and
   George Litefoot

   All these question marks! Determining who is a companion and who is not is one of the most common fan debates. It is possible by the fact that the television programme itself offers no definition for the term. Though probably exacerbated by the
   BBC Wales
   version's greater narrative flexibility, the debate is hardly a new one. It's been going on for ages, fuelled in previous decades by officially licensed reference works that helped mould fan opinion. For instance,
   the Brigadier
   , one of the people whose companion status is most hotly contested, gets some support for his alleged "companion status" from the book

    The Making of Doctor Who

   , in which two of the main writers of his era of the programme unambiguously called him a companion. Likewise, the later

  <p key="e882e757-8aad-4eec-9b45-ee093d8c3d22">
   Still, though the new series put the

   </i>
   "companion" on more solid narrative ground, it greatly confuses the definition.
