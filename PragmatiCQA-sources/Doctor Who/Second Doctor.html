   The Doctor allowed Polly to pilot the TARDIS to their next destination, which was supposed to be Russia in the
   18th century
   , but they landed in
   1942
   instead, shortly before a battle between the German army and the Soviet air force. The Doctor was arrested by
   Nadia Vasney

   Tatiana Kregki
   was impersonating Polly, but despite this, the TARDIS team still helped her stand up to Nadia. (

He thought there was something living on the asteroid that didn't want the humans there, and after communicating with it, he was kidnapped.

   After the TARDIS was stolen at the behest of the Daleks, the Doctor and Jamie were lured by
   Edward Waterfield
   who transported them back to
   2 June

   Theodore Maxtible
   recruited the Doctor to help their experiment to isolate the
   Human Factor

   Victoria
   being held hostage by the Daleks. Using Jamie as an unwilling subject, the Doctor successfully identified the factor and implanted it into three Daleks who he named
   Alpha

   Dalek Emperor
   . The Emperor revealed they'd tricked the Doctor into identifying the
   Dalek Factor
   to spread on humans and the Doctor in turn tricked the Daleks into believing he'd been converted by the Dalek Factor. With the three humanised Daleks causing unrest, the Doctor suggested that all Daleks be sent through a Dalek Factor conversion arch, having switched it to pass on the Human Factor instead. This instigated a
   civil war
   on Skaro, during which Edward was killed saving the Doctor from a
   Black Dalek
   . Promising to look after his daughter, the Doctor and Jamie left with Victoria, believing the Daleks had met their "final end". (

However, the wasps arrived to attack the Quarks and the battle between them enabled the Doctor and Jamie to make a break for the exit. After a close encounter with a wasp near the exit, which resulted in the creature's demise, the Doctor and Jamie made it to the TARDIS and left. (

   After the Doctor gained one of Voir's pendants by asking for an autograph, Helicon Prime was sabotaged into becoming dangerously out of its orbit. In the chaos, the Doctor and Jamie saw Dromeo rummage through some rooms looking for the treasure. Confronting him, Dromeo confessed he was a member of the rescue mission for Fennus that was unable to save the colonists, but found out that they saved all their knowledge and power into a lost database. He asked the Doctor to collaborate with him, but the Doctor left Jamie the task of deciding whether to help the ambassador. Jamie refused. In the following confusion, the Doctor managed to set the station back to its orbit, and he and Jamie escaped in the TARDIS. (
