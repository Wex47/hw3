   instantly believed himself superior to almost anyone he encountered. He would often browbeat others into submission with his savage wit and his grammarian's interest in language. Even so, his mercurial and flippant tendencies did not define the true heart of his persona. Beneath his thunderous and turbulent exterior, he was quite the opposite: a passionate, warm, virtuous and empathetic individual.

   , he physically assaulted her due to post-regenerative paranoia. It took considerable time for himself and Peri to stop bickering and speak together on amiable terms, but the Sixth Doctor eventually became someone she could rely upon. With enough distance from the regenerative event, she was able to look to the Doctor for strength after her mother's death.

   Despite his bluster, the Sixth Doctor did possess great reserves of compassion. His gentler side began to blossom largely as a consequence of travelling with

   who thought him to be the Scarlet Pimpernel. Whilst Blakeney was ill the Dcotor continued his work. He was interested on who caused this illness which was anachronistic. He was also concerned as Blakeney was a fictional being. He asked her to also retrieve a gadget he left in France to work out either way. He grew bored on the servants constantly asking about the upcoming ball. He learnt that Blakeney was a time traveller from the future. Percy told him that the
   Z22
   caused the genocide of his race, but he learnt from
   Tyrax
   that the android was created to serve justice on Percy for the genocide he caused. He felt betrayed because of this. After
   Donat
   almost killed him, the Doctor helped him back to health and put him in a coma on the TARDIS. He took him to his prison cell to serve his sentence for genocide. (

   After travelling for several months, the Doctor and Mila landed in an alternate timeline created by the Viyrans' attempt to remove a virus from Earth's population. Here, the Doctor discovered that Mila wasn't the real Charley, and Charley had been found and cured by the Viyrans, whom she helped for several millennia in their quest to expunge all the viruses which had escaped from the Amethyst station. After Mila sacrificed herself to save the Doctor and the Earth, Charley revealed her identity to the Doctor, and pleaded with him to allow her to restore the

He accepted, and she used the Viyrans' memory-altering technology to replace the Doctor's memories of their travels together with fabricated ones of Mila in their place. (

   thought he had caused it. After learning from Halus that the air car tracks went into the ionosphere of the planet, he thought that the
   Cortex
   was deliberately wanting to kill its people when the shock of the nearby stars nova reached the planet. Flip managed to bust him out prison to help stop the airways. Learning about the Urge from
   Dakeem
   , the Doctor tried to negotiate with it and discovered it came from an alternative dimension, and that it wanted to destroy the planet to allow it to become a physical being again. Whilst Flip was disrupting the traffic, the Doctor used the TARDIS to blot out the sun, as the Urge was using its energy to carry out its plan. (

   While resting on

   24th century

   Sil
   using
   Anzor's TARDIS
   , as Sil wanted access to a Time Lord to try and copy their remarkable ability to cope with disease as part of a plan to reduce Earth's population to a more manageable level via a series of plagues. Despite the involvement of
   Cordelia Crozier
   , who blamed the Doctor for the death of her father, and the involvement of the
   Velandari

   After leaving Flip in

After Yrcarnos died from poisoning, the Doctor declined to investigate, as Peri had not asked him too, but looked into the matter in private, and discovered that Peri had poisoned Yrcarnos, leading the Doctor to believe that Lord Kiv had successfully transferred himself into Peri's body.

   After five years in prison, the Doctor was finally pardoned and made Peri's royal adviser. Accompanying her on a royal visit, the Doctor was accused of murdering Peri when she collapsed from a poisoning, but he was able to keep her alive. Following a second murder, and after switching minds with Peri, the Doctor discovered it wasn't Kiv in Peri's body, but
   Mandrake
   , his childhood imaginary friend. The Doctor defeated Mandrake inside Peri's mind, while Peri, in the Doctor's body, managed to get him back to the TARDIS and trigger the antidote to cure her body. The Doctor then offered her the chance to travel with him again. (

Together the two devised a plan to stop them by diverting on Elysium the cancellation wave meant to destroy Earth, but in order to do so the Doctor suggested letting one of the Speravore larvae feed on him - which would cause him to suffer great harm and possibly regenerate. River couldn't allow that, and diverted the larvae onto other subjects, but the resulting energy was not enough, and different alternatives Earth started competing for existence. To spare the Doctor the guilt, River used her amnesia lipstick on him so that he would have no memory of their encounter. (

Since the Nathemus fed off telepathic energy, they gained access to its telepathic link, and by extension, the Doctor's mind when he interacted with his ship symbiotically, which let them feed until they were able to gain access to the Matrix, giving the Valeyard a means to take it over and alter history. Because of this, both the Doctor and his TARDIS were now empowering the Nathemus and subject to their influence.

   Having been completely defeated in the present, the Doctor realised the only way to break the parasitic hold the Nathemus had on him would be to put a halt to the Valeyard's master scheme in the past. He sent himself a psychic signal via a telepathic impulse from his own TARDIS to go to Lakertya regardless of the danger and experience the deadly radiation, believing he would die if he did so. Suddenly put in a threatened position, the Valeyard tried to convince the Doctor not to go with his plan, but the Doctor carried on, readying himself for the end by reminiscing of all the companions he had during his lifetime. The Valeyard challenged him with the fact that if he didn't die, but regenerated, the Nathemus would still survive. However, the Doctor knew through the process of regeneration, all the cells in his body would be replaced anew, including those of his mind. The Nathemus were linked to the unique mind he had in his present state, but with his mind reshaped, the Nathemus would no longer have any connection with him to feed on it or subsequently manipulate the TARDIS, starving them to death.

   After sending his past self the message, therefore undoing all the damage the Valeyard managed to inflict on history, the Valeyard found himself reduced to a powerless form in the Matrix, cut off from the universe and left to shrivel up and die, though it also meant the end for the Sixth Doctor as well. His consciousness began to wane in the wake of time being rewritten, and he sensed the change occurring. (

   , a radiation lethal to Time Lords is the reason behind the Sixth Doctor's end. However, it did not appear to factor in the infamous "bang on the head" as an event coinciding with the Doctor's regeneration in any explicit way due to the fact it is not mentioned through dialogue nor possible to tell if the Doctor hit his head because there is no visual indicator of such a thing happening in the story. However, the Doctor is heard screaming in agony after being buffeted from a strong burst of radiation while a violent crashing sound is audible, proving he suffered some kind of physical trauma. Furthermore, though the Doctor soon afterwards collapses to the floor, there is no evidence of him hitting his head on the way down. It also seems to pull elements from

   If anything, the Doctor is either recalling his regeneration inaccurately or generalising it. The former is possible because not only does the stressful process of regeneration often hamper the Doctor's mind and ability to remember things correctly, the Seventh Doctor was subjected to a heavy dose of an amnesia-inducing drug by the Rani not long after regenerating that may have jumbled some of his memories in a lasting manner even after it was out of his system. Moreover, Mel did not witness him regenerate or learn why exactly he did so, robbing both of them of credible accounts of the regeneration. In addition, the latter becomes a possibility as the Doctor is known to lie, make light of events in a dismissive and/or joking manner and even make up things as he goes along as the

    Colin Baker related the character of the Doctor to a quote from Rudyard Kipling "I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all places are alike to me". This made him decide to wear a different cat badge on his costume in each story arc. He subsequently received a lot more cat badges from fans in the mail. When he played the Doctor on stage in 1989 these gifts gave him the opportunity to wear a different badge in every single performance.
