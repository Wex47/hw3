   A second account showed that the Sixth Doctor was sent a psychic signal advising him to go to the planet
   Lakertya
   , despite an ominous source of
   radiation
   being nearby. Upon approaching Lakertya, the TARDIS came under attack from focused beams of the radiation being fired from
   the Rani's TARDIS
   . Whilst Mel only passed out, the Doctor was mortally wounded by the radiation. As the persona of the Seventh Doctor manifested before him, the Doctor's sixth persona dissolved into his seventh, both agreeing their future was "in safe hands." (

   After the laser attack, the TARDIS was caught in the Rani's
   tractor beam
   , and forced to make a landing on Lakertya's surface, where the Rani and her
   Tetrap
   servant,
   Urak
   , boarded the TARDIS and abducted the Doctor as his regeneration concluded, taking him to the Rani's laboratory. Awakening in the Rani's lab, the Doctor immediately recognised her, but was knocked out by Urak and injected with an
   amnesia
   -inducing drug, which allowed the Rani to trick him into assisting her with her project by pretending to be Mel. Upon regaining consciousness again, the partially amnesiac Doctor first decided to choose a new look, before returning to work on the Rani's machine, having been convinced by "Mel" that he had been working on it before an accident caused him to regenerate.

   However, as the Doctor found what was wrong with it, the real Mel snuck into the lab and the two convinced each other of their identities, exposing the Rani's lies. Escaping, the Doctor discovered that several other geniuses from throughout time, including
   Albert Einstein
   and
   Hypatia
   , had been captured to act as components of the Rani's "time brain". Forced to become the final component, the Doctor's still recovering mind caused it to spout nonsense, though he also inadvertently provided the brain with the means to determine the needed substance:
   Loyhargil
   . The Lakertyan leader,
   Beyus
   , then sacrificed his life to destroy the brain and delay the launch long enough for the rocket to miss the asteroid. Rescuing the captives, the Doctor took them back to their own times. (

   Arriving in 1987 Britain, the Doctor and Mel were shocked to see a tower in the exact form of a Dalek, serving as the main office of the

   research base, only for the Sontaran research team assigned there to have gone insane, with most of them dead and the surviving commander a gibbering wreck hiding in the cells. When a new Sontaran force was sent to investigate, the Doctor realised that the cause of the mental imbalance was the telepathic influence of a silicon-based life-form in the base's former mines, which identified itself as "
   The Bloom
   ", absorbing the emotions of the residents of the facility to allow itself to grow. While the original miners had only been affected by the Bloom after prolonged exposure to it, the Sontarans' experiments at influencing human emotions had given the Bloom far more emotional material to "feed" on, driving the Sontarans and the former prisoners to increasingly irrational actions, such as Sontarans fighting each other and one of the prisoners trying to break a glass observation dome despite the planet's tainted atmosphere.

  <p key="e32f7b65-f94c-46dc-bb97-275c719bc02e">
   As a result of this emotional "stimuli", the Bloom had achieved sentience at the cost of making it far more hostile due to the Sontarans' violent nature, now manifesting as a dust cloud that consumed the humans and Sontarans to gain their knowledge and experience. Despite acknowledging the Bloom as a sentient creature with a right to exist, the Doctor refused to let it continue in its current state due to the danger it posed to others, tricking the last Sontaran present into carrying bombs directly into the Bloom while he, Mel and the remaining human survivors retreated to the TARDIS, the Doctor hopeful that the explosion would disperse the Bloom to such an extent that it would have to start its "evolution" over again and hopefully become something more peaceful.

   The other Doctor and Mel successfully landed on Puxatornee, and were captured and interrogated by the new history's Lt. Stuart and Reed before the old history's Reed and Stuart arrived to help them escape, but were killed shortly afterwards. The new history's Stuart and Reed then forced the Doctor and Mel to take them back thirty years so that they could prevent the president's death and make peace with Slithergees. The Doctor and Mel took them back to 3060 to see their new history, which was the first version before he and Mel showed up. Lt Stuart and Reed then ordered the Doctor to take them back to the previous day to prevent their earlier selves from time travelling, but the Doctor couldn't as that history no longer existed. The Doctor worked out that an alternative version of himself and Mel were due to land and took off in the TARDIS just as their earlier selves showed up. (

   Vael

   Phaedrus

   , allowing them to place their shadow on him as security and devising a trap to banish them instead. He brought Ace and Benny along, however his plan to banish the Scourge when they attempted to arrive on Earth failed as they’d anticipated his betrayal. They activated their shadow to take him over, however he entered a coma to hold back the Scourge soldier in his mind which also delayed their travel to Earth. Benny used a psychic,
   Annie Carpenter
   , who had been the Scourge’s bridgehead to make contact with him and enter his mind. Benny’s efforts to help him appeared to fail as he fell into the Scourge group mind, however from there he devised a plan and contacted Ace. Benny entered his mind a second time and they prevailed against the Scourge soldier, allowing him to awaken and rally the humans at the hotel to deprive the Scourge of their power over humanity so he could banish them.

The Doctor and Benny had to work together to try and discover what happened, all while being chased by agents of Arviem 2’s government as dangerous individuals. When they eventually did discover the truth, Benny struck Renk out cold, and the Doctor brought him in the TARDIS to have “a nice little chat” with him, before telling Benny why he contacted her. (

The Doctor was finally able to land on Skaro and reunited with Benny, who told him the bits and pieces of Daleks’ history she saw happening in the Dalek city, due to time being out of balance. She said she thought that the original Daleks hated themselves for their form, remembered what it was like to be the
   Kaleds
   , and wished one day to come out of their shells. The Doctor also told Benny that he sent her to look for Ace because he didn’t dare to go to Skaro, and he was also curious to see if Ace succeeded in destroying the Daleks. When the last Dalek alive in the city captured Ace and went on to revive the Daleks on Skaro, the Doctor told Benny to give it the Omega device, and to remember what she saw. Benny understood and activated the device, allowing the Dalek to meet its future form, the
   Dalek Emperor
   . The Dalek was horrified by its future and shot him, prompting the Emperor to shoot in reverse; this caused a paradox which set time in the right order. The Doctor, Benny and Ace then departed together, effectively reuniting the “old gang”, as Benny called them. (

   The Doctor tricked Sutekh by luring him to the
   29th century
   , a time when life on Earth had already finished, to make him think he had won. To do that, he used
   Russell
   and
   Susannah Courtland
   ’s cult of Sutekh as a focal point, transporting them through time from the 20th century, during one of their ceremonies in honour of the god. In the 29th century, the Doctor kept acting as if there were no point fighting Sutekh, exasperating Ace and Benny; he didn’t intervene when Sutekh killed Russell, Susannah and their cultists, but he instead encouraged Isis to act against Sutekh. Isis went against Sutekh and let him kill her, but that was only an act of reincarnation; she actually reincarnated into
   Alyx
   , a young girl the Courtlands adopted to sacrifice her to Sutekh. The Doctor recognised the reincarnation and only then revealed to Sutekh that he had been tricked. In response, Sutekh created a time storm that would allow him to come back in time and ensure this future of devastation would happen; in doing so, he also possessed the Doctor’s body, bringing him along with him, since his body was decaying.

To this end, he began to monitor interstellar communications across thousands of worlds, from the wireless communications of a multitude of law enforcement organisations to the private correspondence of governments and the criminal underworlds.

   1990s
   to take her with him on his search for answers. He managed to make Klein follow him from a pub into his TARDIS, unintentionally with junior science officer
   Will Arrowsmith
   in tow. Travelling to
   1945
   Düsseldorf
   , they met
   Lukas Hinterberger
   , a Nazi who claimed to be one of Schalk's colleague, who apparently recognised Klein and immediately opened up to her, raising suspicion from Klein and the Doctor.

   Hinterberger told them about beings called the Struwwelpeter, and eventually agreed to take them to Schalk. Arriving on the Greek island of
   Minos
   , they came face to face with the Struwwelpeter, godlike beings from another universe whose true names were the
   Shepherd and Shepherdess
   . Considering this universe to be evil and decadent, they gave Schalk the knowledge to build a device known as the
   Persuasion machine
   so that they could manipulate all beings in the universe to submit to their will. The Doctor trapped them on
   New Peerlessness

   The Doctor found a weapons auction intergalactic commercial being presented by
   Garundel
   , and realised Garundel was auctioning Schalk alongside a prototype of the persuasion machine. Fearing his presence would raise suspicion, the Doctor sent Klein and Will to reclaim Schalk and steal the device before it was sold, while he waited in the TARDIS for them to enable him to land inside the compound.
  </p>
  <p key="688c1f4a-87c9-436d-9d47-f455971198ec">
   After Will gave the safety signal, the TARDIS was intercepted by
   Ziv
   , Garundel's assistant, who had taken Will hostage and locked him out of the space ship, as the auction was invaded by the
   Sontarans
   . Forced to accompany Garundel to find Will and Ziv, the Doctor learned that Schalk seemingly didn't have knowledge of the machine, and aided Garundel in making his pod fast enough to catch up to Will and Ziv. Catching up with their assistants, the Doctor and Garundel were fired upon by the Sontarans, who had taken Klein hostage, but they managed to escape the ship via a teleport, reuniting with both Will and Ziv.

   While negotiating Klein's release, the Doctor discovered that the man they were selling was not Schalk, but
   a different man
   he had met in
   Minos
   , and that he was dead. Using the prototype of the machine to persuade Garundel and Ziv to rescue Klein, the Doctor explained to Will that the body they had found was actually that of Hinterberger; Schalk had used the machine to convince Hinterberger he was Schalk and then used it on himself to convince himself that he was Hinterberger. The Doctor boarded the Sontaran ship and, after reuniting with Klein and Will, reluctantly allowed Marshall
   Stenn
   to have his revenge on Garundel, taking his dismembered hand to free the TARDIS from his lockdown. (

   Azimuth
   , where the trio discovered that it had become illegal to mention the Daleks by name, which got Will arrested when the Doctor mentioned them. After getting an audience with a Dalek clone of Schalk, the Doctor and Klein concluded that the Daleks were still hidden on Azimuth. The Doctor revealed to Klein that there was a blood connection between her and Schalk, prompting her to ask him to take her to 1945 to discover the truth, just as Will returned and told them about a man called "Father" that wanted a meeting with the Doctor.
  </p>
  <p key="6447d01d-9e2f-40fa-98ef-d75ac0233033">
   Going to the meeting alone, the Doctor discovered that Father was actually
   Davros
   , and the two were taken to the Daleks and Schalk, enabling the Doctor to deduce that Klein had travelled in the TARDIS to three weeks before they first arrived in Düsseldorf, discovered that Schalk was her biological father, and that she was engineered to operate the Persuasion machine. At that moment, Klein returned in the TARDIS and, having seemingly reverted to her original counterpart, claimed to be willing to become the tool for the Persuasion machine. A man called
   Falkus
   then entered the room and, revealing himself as Davros's "son", ordered the Daleks to exterminate Schalk, but Klein forced the Daleks and Falkus to die with the power of the machine. Will returned with the Shepherd, who threatened to kill them all, but Klein used the power of the machine to kill the Shepherd, dying in the process.

  <p key="2ece1141-6d44-42fd-ad7a-96ae5ff24aa2">
   After ensuring that Davros' escape pod would land on Lemuria, the Doctor and Will noticed that the Klein who had just died was actually
   her mother
   , prompting them to search for Klein on 1945 Earth. Tracking her to
   Russia
   , the Doctor apologised to Klein for judging her by her Nazi counterpart, just as Will alerted them to the fact that they were surrounded by the
   Red Army

   Doctor
   Grace Holloway
   was called to undertake exploratory surgery to "fix" his abnormal heartbeat. The Doctor woke up just as Holloway began the surgery, and tried to stop her operating on him by explaining his non-terrestrial origins, but Holloway and the surgeons believed him to be acting irrational due to the pain and quickly put him under

Holloway quickly became lost in the Doctor's cardiovascular system, and he began to flatline when she damaged his circulatory system with her probe. Though the team attempted to revive him, their attempts only allowed to Doctor to awaken briefly, and he was pronounced dead after he let out a final scream.
