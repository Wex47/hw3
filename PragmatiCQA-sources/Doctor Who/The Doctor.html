    was an unreadable, guarded figure who was, at first, slow to trust newcomers who learnt of him, but once his trust had been earned, he would show another side of himself as a staunch anti-authoritarian with a mischievous streak. This Doctor was often irascible. He made his anger obvious. He was protective of the young women he took on as companions; they reminded him of his granddaughter,

    , in contrast, was warm and wise. He was as surprised and frightened of alien menaces as those who faced them with him. He had a knack for manipulation and deception, and especially enjoyed to play a buffoon in order to trick his opponents into underestimating him so that he could better carry out his plans. His predecessor would refer to him as a "clown" due to his bumbling nature. He loved tootling on his
    recorder
    and carried around a 500-year diary, trying to record his travels, but ended up discarding it. He wore
    a big fur coat
    that dwarfed him, tying it closed with twine. A "cosmic hobo," he was forever getting himself in and out of trouble.

The Doctor's tenth incarnation expressed a deep fondness for his fifth incarnation, (

   the DWU, and who have in some cases met the "real" Doctor, have also sometimes been conceptualised as pastiches of the character of the Doctor.
   Sabbath Dei
   was envisioned by
   Lawrence Miles
   as the individual who took on the role of the Doctor in the
   post-War universe
   , although he was later developed into a more villainous figure.
   Iris Wildthyme
   is not only a mildly ironic pastiche of the Doctor, but is, thanks to her metafictional qualities, aware of it, and

   has the Doctor himself act with mild annoyance around Iris precisely due to his knowledge that she is duplicating his own life.
