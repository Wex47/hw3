   According to the Doctor, she was "impossible" due to their meetings previously in his personal timeline, with two such encounters where he saw her die. Though assured by the
   empathic psychic
   Emma Grayling
   and the

   that Clara was just an "ordinary girl", the Doctor couldn't believe that to be true and thought her to be "the only mystery worth solving".

   on

   in order to try to reverse the damage done to his

   Great Intelligence
   . This caused the

   After Trenzalore, Clara became a school teacher, though she still travelled with the Doctor, meeting the Doctor's
   War

   Clara later met and fell in love with fellow schoolteacher
   Danny Pink

  </p>
  <p key="aae6b44a-ebe5-489d-b803-7195cc4dca75">
   After the loss of Danny, Clara became less attached to Earth and began to copy the heroic aspects of the Doctor's persona; this caused her to become increasingly reckless, as she believed he would always have a plan.
  </p>
  <p key="3f646b89-2faa-4fab-a42c-de9b49dc7a74">
   Clara's heroics eventually cost her greatly; trying to prove
   Rigsy
   's innocence of a false murder, she took a
   Chronolock
   , which killed the one branded, from him. She was later extracted from her own fixed point of death in her timeline by the Doctor using an
   extraction chamber

   The Doctor then stole
   a TARDIS
   and escaped Gallifrey, travelling to the
   end of the universe
   in an attempt to fully bring Clara back, proving to be ineffective, however. The Doctor planned to wipe Clara's memory of ever travelling with him, yet instead, in a turn of events, the Doctor lost his memories of Clara. She then left in the other TARDIS, planning to use it to travel "the long way round" back to Gallifrey, with
   Ashildr
   and
   Willa Twiston
   for company.

   was "rubbish". As a child, she claimed she was always losing things: her "best
   pencil
   ", her school bag, her gran and her "
   mojo

   Sweetville

   Winifred Gillyflower

   mysterious partner

Clara was successfully preserved by the matter and was placed with another survivor into a glass dome in one of the Sweetville houses, awaiting the next part of Mrs Gillyflower's insane plan. After
   Jenny Flint
   rescued the Doctor from being held by
   Ada Gillyflower

   catatonic

   red leech
   , Mr Sweet — planned to fire a rocket that would spread the "Crimson Horror" all around the world, wiping humanity out except for those preserved by being lowered into the liquid. Clara broke a chair on Mrs Gillyflower's control console preventing her from triggering the rocket. After the Crimson Horror was safely removed from the rocket, Mrs Gillyflower threatened to kill the Doctor and Clara anyway. She was shot by
   Strax

Before she could process the thought entirely, the kids begged her to take them to an adventure, or else they would tell their father that their nanny was a time traveller. Clara, lacking any other choice, agreed. (

   space

   other versions of her

   an incarnation of the Doctor that she'd never met
   . This version was the only one to break the promise of the name "the Doctor". However, the stress of the experience caused Clara to faint, so she didn't find out anything more about this incarnation. Clara and the Eleventh Doctor then departed, with the mysterious Doctor watching them leave. (

She was therefore present when the Doctor changed history as he remembered it, and saved Gallifrey instead of destroying it. Back on Earth, she briefly met

   The Doctor pulled a secret key out of the wig he was wearing and summoned the TARDIS, saving them both. Dressed in proper clothes again, he then flew the TARDIS to the nearby town of
   Christmas
   , where they learnt that the town was surrounded in a truth field. Searching for the source of the transmission, the two found a
   crack in time
   , and the Doctor realised that it was the Time Lords trying to return to the universe. The Doctor then explained that if he said his real name the Time Lords would return but all hell would then break loose. After learning from Tasha Lem that the planet was
   Trenzalore
   , the Doctor had Clara return to the TARDIS. In the TARDIS, Clara inserted a device the Doctor gave her and was returned home, but grabbed onto the TARDIS as it dematerialised again.

   Clara returned to Trenzalore three hundred years after she left and found the Doctor middle-aged. The Doctor had been defending Trenzalore from the various threats besieging the planet and revealed to Clara that he had used up all of his regenerations and this would be the end of him. Clara begged him to let someone else take up the job of protecting the planet, but the Doctor refused. Clara watched the planet's brief sunrise with him, during which Handles ceased functioning and the two were invited by Tasha to return to the Papal Mainframe.

   There, Clara and the Doctor were led into a trap, as the Daleks had already taken over the Mainframe and converted everyone, including Tasha, into
   Dalek puppets
   . When the Doctor threatened to release the Time Lords if the Daleks tried to kill him, Tasha took Clara hostage, and the Doctor claimed not to care if she died. Bravely, Clara declared she would die anyway. Using Clara as an example of bravery, the Doctor helped Tasha regain control of herself and she teleported them back to the planet after disposing of the Daleks.

   The Doctor and Clara returned to the TARDIS where they found Clara's turkey cooked, and after promising never to send her away again, he tricked her into returning home once more. As a grief-stricken Clara celebrated Christmas dinner with her family, she had her grandmother repeat the story of how she fell for her grandfather and was relieved to hear the TARDIS returning for her again, grabbing a Christmas cracker to take to the Doctor. To her surprise, Clara discovered Tasha piloting the TARDIS, and Tasha returned her to Trenzalore sometime further into the future after she left, telling her to go find the Doctor.

   Upon reuniting with the Doctor, Clara found him very old and weak. While they sat together, Clara opened the cracker and read the poem inside. When the Daleks demanded his surrender, he agreed but asked Clara to remain behind for her own safety. Desperate to change the future, Clara pleaded to the Time Lords for help through the crack. To her surprise, the crack snapped shut disappeared.

   Clara watched tearfully as the Doctor stood on top of Christmas' Clock Tower and surrendered to the Daleks, prepared to die at last. As the Daleks hesitated and the Doctor goaded them on, the Time Lords granted the Doctor a new regenerative cycle. To Clara's relief, the Doctor began to regenerate, using the explosive force of his regeneration energy to destroy the Daleks. When the dust cleared, there was no sign of the Doctor, so Clara checked the TARDIS where she found him restored to his youthful self. However, the Doctor told her that he would still regenerate.

   Victorian

   Jenny

   Strax

Upstairs, the Doctor escaped his room and attempted to communicate with the dinosaur in the Thames, when it suddenly burst into flames. Clara and the Gang left separately and ended up right next to him. The Doctor, still rather confused, disappeared into the Thames.

Clara and the Doctor were taken down to the restaurant "larder" so that the droids could harvest their organs. After being separated from the Doctor, the Half-Face Man interrogated her with threats of death, but remembering what happened when she had unsuccessfully threatened her rebellious students, dared him to, calling him on his bluff and saying that if the new Doctor was

   Clara and the Gang returned to Paternoster Row, finding that the Doctor and the TARDIS had vanished. Clara prepared to ask for a vacancy, believing the Doctor wouldn't come back. However, he did, and Clara happily ran to the TARDIS. Inside, she was surprised to find the Doctor, like his predecessors, had renovated the control room. He affirmed to Clara he was not her boyfriend. Still having great trouble dealing with the sudden changes to the Doctor's regenerated self, Clara showed trepidation to continue travelling with him when the TARDIS landed on Earth. Clara's phone started ringing. Stepping outside, Clara answered the phone and was shocked to hear the voice of the Eleventh Doctor. He told her he was calling from Trenzalore before he had finished regenerating. He told her the new Doctor would be just as scared after the change as she would be and urged her to help him, with the two of them finally exchanging a belated goodbye. This call finally convinced Clara to accept the new Doctor, and she gave him a big hug, despite him protesting he was no longer a "hugging person". The two then realised that instead of Clara's home, they had landed in
   Glasgow

   contest, the Doctor, Clara and Robin were captured by the
   Sheriff of Nottingham
   and his
   robot knights

The Doctor and Robin argued in the cell, leading the guard to believe Clara was the most responsible and mature one of the three - and therefore their leader - so he took her out to the Sheriff. Clara tricked the Sheriff into revealing to her his plans to take over the kingdom. The Sheriff also revealed that he planned to make Clara his consort, and attempted to kiss her, which she avoided. She then warned the Sheriff that he'd "regret that" if he tried again. She managed to escape with Robin, who brought her to his campsite and demanded he tell her what the Doctor knew about the Robin Hood legends, though she ended up telling them about the Doctor's life as well, having been unable to stop once she started. They returned to the castle in the middle of a revolt led by the Doctor, where Robin defeated the Sheriff in a battle. Clara, the Doctor and Robin then teamed up to launch a golden arrow to allow the ship to fly into space. Clara and the Doctor farewelled Robin and set off on more adventures. (

   Clara went on a date with Danny, but some miscommunication caused her to storm off. Returning home, Clara met the Doctor, who convinced her to help him learn if there was a creature that can perfectly hide; he believed this to be why people talk out loud when alone. Using the
   telepathic circuits
   , Clara accidentally landed the TARDIS at the
   West Country Children's Home
   in the
   1990s
   when a call from Danny distracted her. Clara and a young boy called Rupert Pink, who was a younger version of Danny, and they encountered a mysterious
   figure
   hidden by a bed sheet sitting on Rupert's bed. The Doctor, Clara and Rupert turned away from the figure as it left Rupert's bedroom, and they were unable to find out if it was a creature or a child playing a prank. Clara asked the Doctor to take her back to the moment she left Danny, so she could attempt patching things up. However, not only did she mess things up, but the Doctor called her back to the TARDIS, where she met
   Orson Pink
   , who came from 100 years later in Clara's timeline.

   it was a dream. Fear, she told him, can make one kind instead of cruel and cowardly, and a day would come when he was the most afraid. Inside the TARDIS, Orson asked the Doctor what was outside Orson's ship, but Clara entered and asked the Doctor what if there was nothing behind the door, or under everyone's beds, and "What if the big bad Time Lord doesn't want to admit he's just afraid of the dark?" Clara made the Doctor promise to leave and never find out where they had landed. She returned to the 21st century where she decided to make her relationship with Danny a romantic one. She leaned in and
   kissed
   Danny, allowing both of them to overcome their separate fears of becoming a couple. (

   While Clara was preparing for a date with Danny, she refused to go sightseeing with the Doctor. However, when the Doctor received a call from an elderly
   Madame Karabraxos
   , who asked him to rescue
   the Teller
   and its imprisoned mate from the
   Bank of Karabraxos
   before the
   solar storm
   would destroy it, Clara joined the Doctor on the mission. The Doctor recruited
   Saibra
   and
   Psi
   and, disguising himself as "the Architect", orchestrated a bank heist for himself and his new team to commit. The Doctor, Clara and Saibra used
   memory worms
   to erase their recent memories, while Psi deleted his recent memories manually. This allowed them to break into the Bank of Karabraxos without revealing their plan to the Teller, who was forced to work as the bank's telepathic guard by
   Ms Delphox
   , the Head of Bank Security. Following the instructions left by the Architect, the team discovered six devices which they believed were atomic shredders. Preferring a quick and painless death, Saibra was soon forced to use one of them, as later was Psi.

They revealed that the "atomic shredders" were actually
   teleporters
   . Reunited, the team ventured into the bank's private vault, where they discovered the bank's director, a younger Madame Karabraxos. Realising the true identity of the Architect, the Doctor wrote down his phone number and gave it to Karabraxos, who fled the bank. No longer subjected to Karabraxos, the Teller used its psychic powers to restore the Doctor's lost memories, allowing him to learn the true objective of their mission. After freeing the Teller and its mate, the Doctor and his team escaped the planet using the teleporters. Reunited with his TARDIS, the Doctor dropped the two creatures off on an isolated planet. After giving Psi and Saibra their payment and having a meal with them and Clara in the TARDIS, the Doctor returned his companions to their respective times and places, allowing Clara to be back home on time for her date.

   Although the Doctor always returned her home soon after they left, leading a double life didn't prove to be easy for Clara. During one of their adventures, the Doctor and Clara were held prisoner on a
   desert planet
   . As a result, Clara acquired a tan, which surprised Danny. After meeting
   fish people
   with the Doctor, Clara turned up on a date with Danny in a wet dress and with
   seaweed
   in her hair. One day Danny came round to Clara's flat to go running with her, not knowing that she was already exhausted after running for her life on another outing with the Doctor. On another occasion, Danny saw Clara wearing a
   space helmet
   . By that time, the
   rumours
   of Clara's and Danny's romantic relationship were travelling among the students of
   Coal Hill School
   . Clara's two lives finally collided when one morning the Doctor informed her that they were not going to have an adventure that day, explaining that he had a "thing" to do. To her horror, when Clara arrived at Coal Hill School,
   Mr Armitage
   introduced her, Danny and other teachers to the school's new
   caretaker
   , who was actually the Doctor going undercover. He had discovered a
   Skovox Blitzer
   killer robot in the surrounding area and was planning to lure it into the school, where he was going to trap it using
   chronodyne generators
   and send it into the
   Time Vortex
   . However, his plans were spoiled when Danny, whom the Doctor didn't like and whom he claimed he didn't recognise, discovered and switched off some of the chronodyne generators.

  <p key="fb823f93-65ff-44f3-978d-9c3dc278ba37">
   The Doctor was still able to temporarily send the Blitzer into the Time Vortex. Noticing that Clara was familiar with the Doctor, Danny demanded explanations. Clara had to tell him the truth about her life with the Doctor. The Doctor's dislike for Danny increased when he learned that Danny was Clara's boyfriend. Declining his proposal to erase Danny's memories of these events, Clara took the shocked Danny home. Danny was uncomfortable with the fact that Clara "eloped" with the Doctor when he wasn't seeing her. This prompted her to give him an
   invisibility watch
   and take him with her into the TARDIS the next day so that he could observe her interactions with the Doctor. However, the Doctor sensed Danny's presence, and a heated confrontation arose between the two men. As Danny stormed out of the TARDIS, Clara reminded him that it was
   parents' evening
   at Coal Hill School that day, and the pair had to return to their duties.

   During the parents' evening, the Skovox Blitzer suddenly emerged from the Time Vortex earlier than expected, which the Doctor detected. He summoned Clara and gave her his
   sonic screwdriver
   , instructing her to use it to attract the Blitzer's attention and lure it towards the TARDIS. The Doctor used the device that he had built to make the Blitzer think of him as of its superior. This accidentally triggered the Blitzer's self-destruct protocol. However, Danny appeared at the last moment and distracted it, giving the Doctor enough time to deactivate the Blitzer. The Doctor had to acknowledge that Danny had saved the world, while Danny claimed that he didn't need the Doctor to like him, but needed to prove himself a worthy boyfriend for Clara in the Doctor's eyes. Clara shared an evening with Danny. He told her that when he was a soldier, he knew officers like the Doctor, and made Clara promise to tell him if the Doctor ever pushed her too hard. (

However, the Doctor had a backup plan; he had placed his sonic screwdriver in the fourth sword and tricked Kali into destroying her power source. The vengeful spirits forced Kali out of Clara, returning her to normal. Borrowing a shirt from Priyanka, Clara and the Doctor attended the Festival of Light with Priyanka and her new girlfriend

Unwilling to kill a yet-to-be-born and potentially innocent organism, Clara asked for the Doctor's advice - but to her horror, he proclaimed that it was not his place to decide the fate of Earth's Moon and departed in the TARDIS, leaving Clara, Courtney and Lundvik to make a decision on behalf of humankind.

Gus unlocked the luggage car door, allowing Clara and Maisie to the lab, where the Doctor admitted knowing all along, or at least suspecting, that this wouldn't be just a relaxing voyage. Clara realised that the Doctor had once again placed her in a dangerous situation. The Doctor was able to make the Foretold attack him instead of Maisie and, identifying it as an "ancient
   soldier
   being driven by malfunctioning tech", surrendered to it, allowing it to die. Having no more need for the scientists, Gus proceeded to remove all the air from the train, making Clara and the rest of the passengers pass out. The Doctor retained oxygen long enough to use the Foretold's

He explained that he was unable to save the other passengers from the Foretold and that there was a big chance that he wouldn't be able to save Maisie as well, but he still had to risk her life to stop the Foretold, because "sometimes the only choices you have are bad ones, but you still have to choose". Back in the TARDIS, Clara asked the Doctor if he loved the fact that his life was full of dangerous situations and hard decisions, and whether it was like an addiction for him, to which he replied that you couldn't tell if something was an addiction until you tried to give it up. Upon receiving a call from Danny, Clara indicated to him that she had finally parted ways with the Doctor. However, unable to really give up her life in the TARDIS, she lied to the Doctor that Danny wouldn't mind if she continued travelling with the Doctor as long as he brought her home safe and on time, and much to his joy and delight, asked him to take her on a new adventure.

After the crew was surrounded, Clara realised that Rudy was too much of a narcissist to have any self-loathing in his mind for the Umbra to feed on, and sent him to speak to the Umbra. As a result, the inside of Rudy's mind was "like poison" to the Umbra and the Umbra on board were destroyed while trying to feed on his mind. Meanwhile, the Doctor had used the

   While attempting to return Clara home, the Doctor accidentally took the TARDIS to Bristol, and the pair discovered that the TARDIS exterior had reduced in size. Staying behind in the TARDIS to investigate the effect, the Doctor sent Clara to look around and find the cause. Clara met
   Rigsy
   and his
   community service
   crew and learned that people had been disappearing in the area, with murals of them appearing on the walls of a pedestrian tunnel. On returning Clara discovered that the TARDIS had shrunk further, preventing the Doctor from getting out. However, the doorway was still large enough for him to pass Clara his sonic screwdriver, his
   psychic paper

   nanotechnological
   device that allowed him to communicate with Clara and see through her eyes. Putting the small TARDIS in her handbag, Clara set off to find the source of the dimensional leeching.

   Clara once again met Rigsy, and they investigated the disappearances. The Doctor realised that they were dealing with beings from a two-dimensional universe, who were sucking people into flat surfaces. As the two-dimensional entities were advancing on Clara and Rigsy, Clara received a call from Danny and, telling him that she was busy helping a community worker find his missing aunt, quickly hung up. Clara and Rigsy escaped the danger and, when the Doctor realised that the murals were actually the creatures taking forms of their victims, Clara and the rest of the community service crew at the tunnel hid in a nearby engine repair
   warehouse
   . While the group was confused and disorientated, Clara became the leader and attempted to bring them to safety. As the creatures had gradually picked off the community service workers, Clara,
   Fenton
   and Rigsy became the only survivors. The Doctor claimed that he had discovered a way to send the creatures back to their dimension but didn't have enough power to do so. In the chaos, the TARDIS was dropped down a shaft onto a railway. Fleeing from the creatures, Clara found the TARDIS in
   siege mode
   on the tracks and devised a plan to restore its power. She asked Rigsy to paint a fake door with a flattened handle and placed the TARDIS behind it. Attempting to de-flatten the fake handle so that they could open the "door", the creatures unknowingly pumped dimensional energy into the TARDIS, restoring it to its proper size and full power. The Doctor emerged from the TARDIS and, taking his sonic screwdriver back from Clara, sent them back to their dimension. When the threat was over, the Doctor took the survivors to the surface. (

   The Doctor and Clara went on a tour of
   Snowcap University
   in
   Antarctica
   in
   2048
   . While taking a
   helicopter
   ride, they learnt that one of the students,
   Polly Evans
   , had stayed behind at the end of term to join the classified
   Project Sub-Zero
   . When another student,
   Quinn Norton
   , who also a part of Project Sub-Zero, was killed in a helicopter crash the Doctor and Clara narrowly avoided being on along with Polly's father
   George
   , they returned to Snowcap U to investigate. Clara met a research graduate called Winnie Clarence, short for "Oswin Clarence". Winnie looked exactly like Clara and recalled dreams of living a thousand lives in a thousand places. Winnie overheard a discussion between the Doctor and Clara over whether or not this meant she was one of her splinters who was born to die based on a decision Clara made and ran off on a snowmobile. Clara tried following after Winnie but the two fell down a crevasse into an ice cavern where the missing students had been experimented on, engineered by Dr
   Patricia Audley
   to survive in extreme cold. Along with the
   spy
   Paul South
   , Winnie released most of the imprisoned humans from captivity.

   The Doctor transmitted a signal with his sonic causing Dr Audley's animals to go wild. After feigning betrayal of the two, Winnie threw the Doctor the key to free the hybrid subjects from their cells and saved the Doctor's life by pulling Dr Audley into a vat of liquid
   ice
   after Audley pulled a gun on him. Dr Audley was killed, and Winnie appeared to have sacrificed herself, once again, for the Doctor. When Winnie's mother arrived on the scene, Clara, struck with guilt over the death of Winnie, made the decision to live out her life as Winnie to spare Winnie's mother the pain of losing her daughter. Fortunately, Clara did not have to do this as Winnie survived when she unwittingly had a syringe of Dr Audley's experimental blue blood serum injected into her, allowing her to live inside the ice. Clara realised that this meant that not all of the splinters died saving the Doctor, and many of them had lives of their own. The Doctor said that Clara was able to release some of her inner demons as a result of this knowledge. (

The Doctor realised that this meant it intended to end the war between the

Believing it had augmented Clara as well, the Hadax Ura had actually linked the Jungle's computer systems to its own after augmenting the avatar. The avatar appeared to shut down the Hadax Ura and its augmented soldiers, but in fact, the Hadax Ura had tricked Hitch's team to bring it on board the lander as a means of escape for the Hadax Ura.

   Fayre. However, few people had actually turned up. As part of the Fayre's witch hunt, the time traveller

   Matthew Hopkins

Clara accidentally identified the Doctor, who had come to rescue Clara, as a witch, and both were to be executed. Miss Chief brought them back to the 21st century before they could be hanged. The Doctor and Clara convinced Miss Chief to bring them back to retrieve the TARDIS and save Agnes from the dungeons, and unwittingly brought the missing cat
   Smudge
   with them. Clara convinced the mob that Hopkins was a witch and Smudge was his familiar, but the Doctor prevented them from murdering Hopkins by sneakily putting Miss Chief's time travelling Marotte in his belt, forcing Miss Chief to save his life. The Doctor and Clara escaped and returned to Coal Hill. Because of the Doctor and Miss Chief bringing extinct animals and rare artefacts to the 21st century as part of Miss Chief's scavenger hunt game and her making superstitions coming true, the publicity from paranormal, wildlife and antique experts made Clara's fundraiser at the Halloween Fayre a success, and a few months later, Clara opened the Danny Pink IT Suite, which the Doctor was also present at.

During the adventure, Clara briefly gained superhuman-like powers - including the power of flight - due to the Doctor providing her with technology to augment her mental abilities in order to combat the Sea Devils, one of whom she appeared to kill by dropping a chandelier on him, a rare documented case of Clara using deadly force on anyone. Afterwards, Clara told the Doctor outright that she now considered the TARDIS her home. (

   chronolock
   counting down to Rigsy's death, because of Rigsy being accused of murder in the

The Doctor asked how he would cope with her death, and Clara replied they would both have to be brave. She chose to face her end on her own and wished the Doctor goodbye, trying to be as brave as she knew how to be. The Quantum Shade then flew to kill her. (

   Eleventh General

   The two fled into the
   Cloisters

   confession dial
   and his history with the Cloisters. Clara was horrified to realise it had been a very long time for the Doctor since she died and he had changed. Clara confronted the
   Twelfth General
   and
   Ohila
   and demanded to know how long the Doctor had been in the confession dial, learning it was four and a half billion years. She was struck speechless when she realised the depth of his caring for her. At that moment, Clara realised that she and the Doctor should say certain things to each other. After whispering a message to him, Clara turned to the General and Ohila. She refused to reveal what she had told the Doctor, except to indicate that she was a distraction so the Doctor could escape and steal another TARDIS. The Doctor materialised
   a new TARDIS
   around Clara and the Doctor and Clara fled Gallifrey.

   Believing that Clara's heart would restart once they were away from Gallifrey, the Doctor was stunned to realise it hadn't. Desperate, he took her to the
   last five minutes of the universe
   , believing her heart would restart. It did not, and Clara became concerned when the Doctor shouted at her in frustration. When the Doctor left the TARDIS to talk to Ashildr, Clara used the Doctor's sonic sunglasses to activate the TARDIS scanner and watched as the Doctor and Ashildr discussed the Hybrid and Ashildr's theory that it was the Doctor and Clara together since they would do anything, including fracture time to save each other. Hearing that the Doctor planned to wipe her memory of him, Clara reversed the polarity of the neural block using the glasses. When the Doctor returned, she challenged the Doctor over his plans, demanding to be allowed to keep her memories and informing him of her sabotage. The Doctor relented, but indicated that their relationship had become too dangerous; the Doctor decided it was for the best that they were separated. Uncertain as to whether she had actually been able to reverse the polarity of the device, Clara and the Doctor agreed to push the button together and let fate decide. The Doctor and Clara activated the neural block and the Doctor's memory of Clara was erased. Before passing out, the Doctor gave Clara several pieces of advice as to how to be her own Doctor. Clara flew the TARDIS to
   Nevada
   where she dropped the Doctor off and told a
   man
   to look out for him. She then subsequently travelled to London and used the TARDIS to retrieve the Doctor's TARDIS.

   Soon, Clara and Ashildr piloted their TARDIS to Nevada and used its
   chameleon circuit
   to have it take on the form of an American roadside diner. Somehow, the Doctor found himself at the diner. Clara, dressed as a waitress, listened to the Doctor's story of what happened to her and how he couldn't remember much beyond her name and bits of their adventures together. Though the Doctor believed he would recognise her if he met her, he didn't and Clara was devastated. During his visit, the Doctor played a romantic melody. Hearing him play this tune, and realising she had lost the Doctor, Clara suggested that perhaps memories become songs when they are forgotten. With the Doctor turned away and distracted by his playing, Clara opened a door at the rear of the diner, and dematerialised around the Doctor, leaving him with his own TARDIS next to him and a message on his chalk board inside stating "run you clever boy and be a doctor."

   Flying off, Ashildr informed Clara that their chameleon circuit was stuck and their TARDIS was stuck in the form of an American diner. Clara's heart hadn't restarted and she realised that her death was a
   fixed point in time
   and she had to die. However, Clara noted that she was now effectively immortal so she had some "wiggle room". Clara decided to return to Gallifrey to have the Time Lords return her to her death, but to go there "the long way around", going on more adventures with Ashildr. (

   In one timeline, the
   Twelfth Doctor
   did not forgive Clara after she had betrayed his trust following Danny Pink's demise, evicting her from the TARDIS. Without her influence however, the Doctor was consumed by his grief and loneliness, leading him to ally with the
   Voord
   . Though still hurt by her betrayal, Clara remained very important to the Doctor, who was delighted to meet an alternate version of her.

   On a jungle planet, Clara found a museum that held a record of the Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Doctors meeting. Seeking to prevent the dangerous paradoxes of a Multi-Doctor Event, Clara steered the TARDIS to Paris in 1923 to enlist the aid of Gabby Gonzalez and Alice Obiefune only for her preparations to enact the event itself and draw the Reapers to them. After outrunning the predators, the six travelled to the planet Marinus where they fell victim to a continuity bomb, being deposited in a timeline where the Twelfth Doctor had been driven mad with grief and joined the Voord. Intending to ensure his existence, the alternate Doctor imprisoned Clara and his three other selves, planning to wipe their memories and deposit them at the correct times for his plan to work. This timeline was undone when Gabby used a
   Weeping Angel
   to return to the original Parisian meeting and warn their past selves. (

   ghost
