   The series was set largely in and around
   Bannerman Road
   ,
   Ealing
   — the street on which Sarah Jane lived. As shown in the
   initial, New Year's Day special
   , Sarah Jane was a somewhat wealthy and mostly reclusive eccentric. Her somewhat lavish house, car and lifestyle were paid for by her work as a freelance
   journalist
   , and an inheritance from
   the aunt
   established in
   her first
   <i key="029dfc05-fde5-4d06-86c3-41bab1733fb0">

   appearance
   and
   the pilot
   for Sarah Jane's first
   spin-off series
   .
  </p>
  <p key="6aea467d-5568-4bb6-a116-c057ab7a9d28">
   In the opening narrative, she acquired
   an adopted son
   , a highly-evolved
   <a href="Human.html" key="52b7d8db-171d-48a4-bfda-b97289027e1e" title="Human">
    human
   </a>
   , who had been manufactured by the
   Bane
   . Her hitherto lonely life was also invaded by
   Maria
   , a girl who had just moved into the house across the road. Once the series proper began, and her adopted son, Luke, started attending school with Maria, they picked up a third friend, named
   Clyde Langer
   . Initially, then, the format of the series was about the three school-aged kids having
   alien
   -fighting adventures with Sarah Jane, whilst trying to keep
   Maria's divorced dad
   and
   mum
   unaware of their activities. Major subplots included: Maria and Alan Jackson's attempts to have a productive relationship with Chrissie, in the wake of the divorce; Sarah Jane's efforts to be a good mother; Clyde's attempts to help the socially awkward Luke "be cool"; the gradual uncovering of
   Mr Smith
   's true nature; and Alan's discovery of what exactly happened at
   Sarah Jane's house
   .
  </p>
  <p key="98b2b4cb-8176-429d-83dd-06203673ff37">
   Early in
   series 2
   , however, the show obviously scaled back the importance of adults other than Sarah Jane. The Jacksons were dropped from the series, replaced by
   Rani Chandra
   , and her parents
   Gita
   and
   Haresh
   . Unlike the Jacksons, however — who were almost always a significant part of the narrative — the Chandras were much de-emphasised, and often used as mere comic relief. For instance, it took Haresh two series to amass as many appearances as Alan had enjoyed in a single series. Also, the Chandras were often in just one of the two episodes of a story — as in
   <i key="c63b3223-d712-4968-aa65-29cac44d6b16">
    Death of the Doctor
   </i>
   — whereas Alan was typically in both parts. Moreover, the Chandras were all but unused in
   series 4
   , appearing together in
   just one serial
   . Clyde's parents were featured in one story, but it was a story which hardly utilised Sarah Jane. For the most part, parental involvement dropped significantly after
   Alan Jackson
   accepted a job in
   Washington DC
   early in series 2, and was little more than incidental after
   the series 3 premiere
   .
  </p>
  <p key="926d3b10-9ed2-4a02-a680-df1f79084b76">
   Over time, even Sarah Jane's new, maternal role was scaled back.
   Luke Smith
   's presence began to be scaled back in
   series 3
   , such that he was largely absent from several episodes. By
   series 4
   , he was said to be in university a year earlier than the two other kids and was thus reduced to a recurring guest star. Practically speaking, the show's format for the last two series featured Sarah Jane, Clyde, Rani and Mr Smith as the major characters, with everyone else reduced to supporting roles.
  </p>
  <p key="3691f27f-7da3-4ae8-8da1-a1437ec3597a">
   Common character "beats" that reverberated during the time that Rani was on the show included: the greater involvement of

   in Sarah Jane's life; Haresh's role as the headmaster of the kids' school; the contentious relationship between Sarah Jane's two computers,
   Mr Smith
   and
   K9
   ; Luke's continued communication with an off-screen Maria; the recurring threat of
   the Trickster
   ; and a certain level of subtle romantic tension between Clyde and Rani.

    Series 3 also saw a change in the episodic format, with the pre-titles sequence being shortened because of the addition of an opening narration by

   British Broadcasting Corporation
   about any of these cast changes.

  <p key="2eee75f2-ebe7-414f-839e-5e8defdb383a">
   Kelsey Hooper
   was apparently the original "third kid" in
   <i key="f7cdd757-29c2-4899-90bb-1af1e0732170">
    Invasion of the Bane
   </i>
   , but she was quietly replaced in series 1 "proper" by
   Clyde Langer
   . No reason was ever given by the BBC for this cast change. However, it is possible to believe that Kelsey was never actually intended as a permanent cast member since
   <i key="8598028f-5109-4b98-a768-6cc60d98d0a2">
    Invasion

   actually wrote her out as unable to handle the "Sarah Jane Smith lifestyle" in its final scenes.
  </p>
  <p key="23d12770-e36e-4d6d-b16a-7269392aff94">
   Maria Jackson
   was the next kid to leave. Though she appeared on much of the
   series 2
   publicity material, and appeared or was heard in three of that year's stories (being referred to in two others), she ceased to be a regular after the first story of the second season. Though rumours have swirled for years about why this character — and, by necessity, her parents — were written out, the BBC has never offered up an explanation for the actor's departure. However, actress
   Yasmin Paige
   left the role during her GCSE year and decided she would concentrate on her studies
   , though it is not clear if she chose to dedicate herself to her scholarly life on a permanent basis and not return to the series.

   Finally,
   Luke Smith
   was absent for some episodes of
   series 3
   and most of the rest of the programme's run - he only appears in the series 4 opener and finale - though he was still touted as a main cast member in official BBC press packs through the end of the series. Actor
   Tommy Knight
   was also clearly part of what was essentially the last thing the BBC filmed about the series, the April 2011 Liz Sladen tribute,
   <i key="50a25ce4-b046-406f-903b-047bac5a9fb9">
    My Sarah Jane
   </i>
   . This indicated, though perhaps didn't absolutely confirm, that Luke's reduced role was amenable to both the BBC and Knight himself.

   <i key="4796c932-6dcb-4528-bd6b-4d688447a7d3">
    SJA
   </i>
   . Since K9 was owned by
   writer
   Bob Baker
   , its appearances had to be specifically negotiated with the writer. Just as

   so as not to compromise then-ongoing negotiations for a K9 series. Why the dog was so heavily used in
   series 3
   , but otherwise little more than a featured cameo in the other series, was never the subject of an official, public announcement.

   with a

   on
   1 January
   2007. A full
   series
   of ten 30-minute episodes followed later in the year.
   The

   had twelve 30-minute episodes and aired in the autumn of 2008, followed by
   a third
   in late 2009. A
   mini-episode
   for charity also aired in early 2009. Meanwhile,
   series four
   went into production in March 2010. At the same time, what was expected to be the first half of the
   fifth series
   was produced as part of the Series 4 recording block, with the second half of the series initially planned for production in early 2011.

   However, because
   Elisabeth Sladen
   died on
   19 April
   2011,
   series 5 was truncated to just those three serials that had been completed in 2010.
   The series, therefore, ended because Sladen died, and no parties to the production of the series wished to continue without her.
