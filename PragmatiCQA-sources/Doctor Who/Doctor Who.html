   23 November
   1963

   The Pilot Episode
   " by fans), was taped some weeks before, but was rejected for several issues. The BBC allowed a second mounting of the pilot to proceed. The first episode aired the day after the
   assassination of John F. Kennedy

   a week later

   BBC Radiophonic Workshop
   , transformed it into a pioneering piece of electronica music. There have been several arrangements used of the theme, but the basic melody has remained unchanged throughout the show's history. No new piece of music has ever been commissioned as a theme, making it one of the longest-serving signature tunes in television history.

   From very early on, the television show spawned a sub-genre of the franchise in the form of short stories in various shapes and forms from small one-paper issues to short novels to even telling a story on a set of cards. This genre has developed throughout the years into massive shorts and anthologies and is still holding up in the
   21st century

   franchise; the books would be published into the mid-1990s. A unique feature of the Target line (in fact dating back to the first novelisations published by
   Frederick Muller
   ) is that many of the books were written by either the original scriptwriters or by individuals with strong behind-the-scenes connections to the series, such as
   Barry Letts
   ,
   Terrance Dicks
   ,
   David Whitaker
   , etc., all of whom worked in
   script editing
   or
   producing
   capacities on the series. In the late 70s, about a dozen of the Target novels were reprinted in American editions by
   Pinnacle Books
   , with introductions by noted science fiction author
   Harlan Ellison
   , who added to the franchise's prestige by placing it higher in his estimation than

Other actors have been considered the "current" Doctor for longer, but without regular television appearances. Near the end of the Tom Baker era, the BBC attempted a spin-off series,

   Davison's era was marked by experimentation by the BBC in terms of broadcast scheduling. The series moved to airing twice a week on weeknights, away from its traditional Saturday slot. Initially, this appeared to be a successful gamble. The ratings for Davison's early stories were on par with - if not higher than - Tom Baker's later stories.

Nathan-Turner also experimented with the characterisation of the Doctor, intentionally making the Sixth Doctor initially unlikeable in order to create a new dynamic. Neither experiment was successful. Colin Baker's tenure was marked by a serious threat to the show's survival when the BBC, citing low ratings, announced it was ending the series after the
   1985
   season, its
   22nd
   . Following immediate outcry, this decision was modified to become an eighteen-month hiatus. During the hiatus, fan efforts were launched to get the show back sooner. These included the recording of a charity record called "
   Doctor in Distress

   BBC Radio

   The question of whether Tennant would stay on was a hot topic in the UK media for much of 2008. On
   19 October
   2008
   , Tennant, while accepting his
   National Television Award
   for Favourite Actor, announced he would leave the role after the specials. After months of speculation, it was announced on

   a total of
   13 times
   , among others — the writers have striven to retain some sense of mystery and to preserve the eternal question, "Doctor who?" This backstory was not rigidly planned from the beginning, but developed gradually and haphazardly over the years, the result of the work of many writers and producers.
  </p>
  <p key="2f74ece8-0b88-44ec-a200-28956588e0c5">
   Understandably, this has led to continuity problems. Characters such as
   the Monk
   were retroactively classified as Time Lords, early histories of races such as the
   <a href="Dalek.html" key="0ea1d00b-506e-48b5-b446-5b039ad03c01" title="Dalek">
    Daleks
   </a>
   were rewritten, unseen versions of the Doctor existed prior to
   William Hartnell
   's version and so on. The creation of a detailed backstory has also led to the criticism that too much being known about the Doctor limits both creative possibilities and the sense of mystery. Some of the stories during the
   Seventh Doctor
   's tenure, part of the so-called "
   Cartmel Masterplan
   ", were intended to deal with this issue by suggesting that much of what was believed about the Doctor was wrong and that they are a far more powerful and mysterious figure than previously thought. In both an untelevised scene in
   <i key="8778a41f-acf6-430f-aad8-9c3c3f3a495c">

   <i key="78821466-74ca-4740-a0a6-a76bdbd56996">

   it is implied (to quote an excised line from "
   <i key="baae5f1f-340c-4666-b6af-b3575f60a1ea">
    Remembrance
   </i>
   ") that the Doctor is "far more than just another Time Lord." The suspension of the series in
   1989
   , however, meant that none of these hints were ever resolved, at least on television. The
   <i key="bfebcb34-1c68-4852-b177-a6fbe7f2e7e8">
    Virgin New Adventures
   </i>
   novel,
   <i key="6c1599e2-3b96-40c4-bdb5-57b4bbb82717">
    Lungbarrow
   </i>
   , did resolve these hints and explain the Doctor's origins. However, not all fans regard the spin-off novels as
   canon
   or accept the revelations made in that particular story, partly because other parts of the franchise seem to contradict parts of it.
  </p>
  <p key="520d1851-ddcb-4f1c-ac1c-638eea2a21b8">
   The
   1996
   television movie
   created even more uncertainty about the character, revealing that the Doctor had a human mother and they remembered their father. Fans, however, seemed to be more upset about the fact that the

   The revelation in the 1996 television movie that the Doctor was half-

    human

  <p key="6075a89e-d9d9-45f7-8eb6-ab58610ad241">
   While some fans regard discontinuities as a problem, others regard it as a source of interest or humour — an attitude taken in the book

   There has been much fan speculation on exactly which aspects of the television series, books, radio dramatisations, and other sources are considered canon. This has been made more complex by the fact that at least one novel, short story, comic, and audio have all been adapted for the TV series. Additionally, the events of at least one novel have been referenced on screen. For their part, the
   BBC
   have never issued a firm edict as to what counts as "canon". Thus,
