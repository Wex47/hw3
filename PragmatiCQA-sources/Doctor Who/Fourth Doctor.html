   When he revealed he knew of several defeats of the Daleks in the future due to faults in their design, the Doctor was forced to tell Davros of each failure the Daleks suffered, so that he could prevent them. Attempting to gauge the extent of his insanity, the Doctor posed a question to Davros, asking him what he would do if he possessed the power to end all other life. Davros's willingness to utilise such power horrified the Doctor, tempting him to cut off his life supports as a last resort of stopping his plans, but he was prevented from doing so by
   Nyder

   The Doctor found little other option left than to ensure the Daleks would never exist, and had the opportunity to blow up the stock of embryonic Daleks that Davros had produced. However, he questioned if he had the right to destroy the Daleks, knowing that wiping out an entire species would make him just like them, and the fear of the Dalek had caused many worlds to ally with each other. With this in mind, the Doctor allowed the Dalek species to persist, and chose to stall their rise to power instead. Failing to listen to the Doctor's warnings, Davros found his own creations usurping him. Because they were programmed to acknowledge any creature as inferior to the Dalek, they deemed him unworthy to rule them. Fleeing after the Daleks killed Davros, the Doctor buried them and their factory underground, delaying their progression by a thousand years. (

   Lord President
   , and theorised that the
   departing President
   was in danger. Stealing a robe to blend in, the Doctor attempted to prevent an assassination, but ended up framed for murdering the Lord President. To keep himself from being executed, the Doctor declared his own candidacy for Lord President. Believing the Matrix would give him clues as to who was behind this, the Doctor ended up in a mental duel with the culprit.

However, even the mind of the Doctor proved insufficient to form a stable connection with the Cathedral; only when the Tenth Doctor joined him at the control, their combined efforts allowed them to move it. The two Doctors first released the pilgrims on a safe space, and then directed the
   Dalek time corridor
   to Earth,
   5,000,000,000

   After the Graak freed his predecessors, the Doctor began pleading with him to save him, as he was in danger of being "swept away" into an "infinite of nothingness". Later, the Doctor informed the Graak to only enter the Determinant when he was "mentally prepared", as failing the challenge would result in certain death, and instructed him to go to the Zygon chamber to retrieve a

After the Graak defeated the Master, the Doctor was finally freed when the Graak sacrificed its life force to liberate the trapped Doctors. (

   The Doctor and Leela uncovered experiments into telepathy undertaken by several university students, which threatened a weakness in the multiverse that was in close proximity, made even worse by a university professor's attempt to create a flawed time machine to undo an event in his past when he beat his daughter to death during an argument. However, due to the interventions of the TARDIS, the damage to the multiverse was repaired, but, as a result, the timeline was replaced by one where the professor reported his crime rather than hiding it. The Doctor noted that he and Leela would forget about the whole affair when they stepped out of the TARDIS, as none of the people they encountered or events they witnessed would have ever existed. (

   Joanna Renwick
   stopped them. Learning that Leela had experienced something whilst rowing, the Doctor theorised that the lights in the sky were not a natural phenomenon, just as Viking artefacts started to attack Joanna. After falling down a hole while trying to find
   Angus Renwick
   , the Doctor was attacked by something in Viking armour, but he found his way onto
   Nardos

The Doctor worked out that the ship's defences were causing time to fracture. He was given the "wolf's eye" from a young Angus and used it to go back to the future, and tried to convince Nardos to stop his plans as it would destroy humanity. (

They found out that Harcourt was a robot built as a speaking database and Jephson was the curator of the new section of the Museum, and wanted to acquire as much knowledge as he could in order to become a real "Renaissance Man". For that reason, he invited several scholars and experts and, with the help of Harcourt, drained their entire memories, transferring them into the database. He managed to drain from Leela her knowledge about
   hunting

Inside the game, the Doctor was reunited with Leela, Marshall and K9; together, they located the secret room where the Master cured Leela, ensuring she stayed victorious. The Doctor and K9 reprogrammed the circuits of the station and changed it into
   teleports
   , and used them to trap the Master and
   Kastrella
   inside the game while they got out. However, Marshall had already been fatally wounded by the Master, and died soon after. The Doctor offered the distraught Leela the chance of coming back to travel with them, and she accepted. (

   The Doctor arrived on
   Funworld
   and encountered
   Amanda Steele
   ’s team who were hunting a predator who had killed all the planet’s workers. After their psychic
   Phelan
   made contact with the predator, the Doctor identified the predator as
   Vashta Nerada
   and realised that they’d been antagonised after the park’s owner,
   Donnelley
   , revealed forests had been cleared for the park’s construction. He urged the team to abandon the park, which they finally agreed to after Phelan was killed. After the last member of her team died, Steele was left trapped however the Doctor saved her using the TARDIS. They realised Donnelley was returning to Earth in her spaceship, which was likely contaminated with Vashta Nerada. Onboard they found Donnelley dead and managed to return the ship to orbit over Funworld, though Steele died in the process by saving the Doctor from Vashta Nerada onboard by poisoning herself and letting them consume her. The Doctor sent a broadcast from the ship warning that Funworld was unsafe and left, lamenting his inability to save anyone. (

   The Doctor explained the situation to the Brains Trust, who agreed that losing what they had built was more favourable to losing their people. Before they could undo the process however, they were attacked by the Moderator General, who refused to remove emotions to his "perfect society".

   harmony booths

The city was left without their totalitarian rulers, leaving ZEPO in charge. The Doctor decided to leave—much to the dismay of ZEPO, who still saw him as his saviour.

   G-Lock
   in
   3012

Realising that he was dealing with the consequences of a future trip, the Doctor resolved to go back in time and learn what had happened on his previous visit, even though all available information suggested that he was destined to die saving the G-Lock. After making a second trip to the G-Lock, as well as a trip back to

   While on course to Gallifrey, the TARDIS fell through a
   Charged Vacuum Emboitment
   and into a smaller pocket universe known as
   E-Space

   Alzarius
   , the Doctor met the
   Alzarians

   Alzarian spider

   to invade. However, they were driven back out by an increase of

Creating an antidote, the Doctor cured Romana and taught the Alzarians how to pilot their ship. During this time, he met a precocious Alzarian boy named
   Adric
   , who snuck on board the TARDIS before they left to find a way back home to their universe as there was nothing left on Alzarius for him. (

   Tired of the TARDIS'
   chameleon circuit
   being stuck, the Doctor went to
   Logopolis
   to obtain the formula needed to fix it. Arriving, the Doctor found a woman named
   Tegan Jovanka
   had accidentally boarded the TARDIS during a brief trip to Earth, thinking it was a police box. He also reunited with
   Nyssa
   , whilst also meeting a being known as
   the Watcher
   ; they had a secret conversation and the Doctor learnt the Watcher was a manifestation of his next incarnation and that he would be regenerating soon. Realising his end was near, the Doctor got the formulas from Logopolis and shrunk the TARDIS by accident due to
   the Master
   's interference, but this was corrected. The Doctor then went to the Pharos radio telescope to a broadcast the CVE signal as the Watcher took Adric and Nyssa outside the universe.

Pulling the plug on the radio that powered the dish to do so, the Doctor ended up hanging onto it as the Master rotated the dish. Dangling from the dish, the Doctor experienced visions of past foes before he lost his grip and fell to the ground.

As a result of his choice, the Doctors, Romana and the TARDISes were erased from time, and Leela was left to die at the hands of the Sirens. However, these events were later cancelled when the paradox was resolved. (

   Since the fourth incarnation was the youngest in appearance at the time, he therefore appeared closer in age to his companions.

   the Doctor and Romana have to huddle close in order to be within the confines of a transporter beam and enter what would, in normal circumstances, be seen as a romantic clinch, but neither character appears to recognise this. Likewise, the Doctor and Romana are forced into close proximity in
