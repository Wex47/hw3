   The Doctor, Fitz and Trix continued to have adventures, overthrowing Mondova, battling the Daleks on Mars, and defeating
   Thorgan
   in 40 BC Italy. At some point, Fitz and Trix began having a relationship, so they decided to leave the TARDIS and live on Earth. Upon arriving on Earth, the Doctor learned that just prior to the destruction of Gallifrey, the sum total of
   the Matrix
   had been placed within his mind with the help of
   Compassion
   . The sheer size of the Matrix in the Doctor's mind was enough to compress his own memories. This had caused his
   amnesia
   , but it was a potential means to rescue the Time Lords. (

   Edith

He and a servant strangle him to reach the place where the dead went before the loop reset, enabling him to talk to Edith and Charley. Together he and Charley convinced Edith of her self-worth, un-doing the paradox as she now never committed suicide. As he and Charley left she revealed she could remember her death on R101, which he said to leave to solve for another day. (

   After witnessing the deaths of Tamsin and Alex during their fight against the Dalek occupation, the Doctor was heartbroken when Lucie Miller sacrificed her life to defeat them. Angry with the deaths caused by the Monk's meddling in time, he refused to forgive the remorseful Monk for helping the Daleks cause the bloodshed of these events. Boiling with rage, the Doctor screamed at the Monk to leave and threw him out of the TARDIS. In his solitude, the Doctor mourned Lucie's death and bleakly promised he would find a way to come back and reverse it. (

   Straxus
   , who warned him the Time Lords did not permit this action and held the patents that gave them knowledge to disable TARDISes. Though furious at having an intruder subjugate his TARDIS, the Doctor accepted a mission to Earth during the

Straxus also revealed that Kotris was his own future incarnation, who had become tired of the Time Lords and their interventions, and wished to destroy them for it. Straxus manipulated Kotris to destroy the Daleks with the projector, rather than the Time Lords. However, a friend of the Doctor's,
   Nadeyan

   . Upon being shown the Wraxians' gallery with the Dalek Prime Strategist, the Doctor learnt that the Wraxians had been defeating numerous other civilisations and keeping spoils of war, and he realised the extent of the time alterations. He investigated the Eye and learnt that it channelled a weapon, the
   Devolver
   , which the Wraxians demonstrated for the Daleks. The Wraxians planned to use the Doctor to target the Time Lords, but the Prime Strategist saved him and he returned to the gallery, where he devised a theory on the source of the alterations. With the Prime Strategist's help, the Doctor convinced the Daleks to let him negotiate with
   the Wraxian President
   before she could wipe out the Daleks with the Devolver. She tried to convince the Doctor to use the Devolver, but he refused and instead convinced her to disarm it in return for the Daleks' withdrawal. He told the Daleks they needed to go back to the
   Dark Times
   , by linking the TARDIS and the Dalek timeship, to find the source of the alterations. (

However, even with the Free Undead, the Doctors were unable to stop the Daleks' army of undead drones with Symbiont DNA, so they prepared to collide the flagship with the saucer, in the hopes of the ensuing paradox wiping out the Daleks, but were prevented from doing so when Inyit used her final judgement to wipe out the
   Dalek Symbiont
   and the hybrids, ending the Daleks' assault as they panicked, fearing the judgement may spread to pure Dalek DNA. This allowed the Eighth Doctor to sneak aboard with the aid of a Bloodsman. There, the Doctor used a remote detonator to trigger an explosive Brian had left in the saucer's engine room, forcing the saucer into the Time Vortex and away from the Dark Times. (

The Doctor then found the two prisoners,
   Tiska

   Groth

When he and Tiska reached the bulkheads, the Doctor detonated his explosive, killing the Dalek Scientist and exposing the other half of the saucer to the Time Vortex, resulting in it breaking apart. As they headed for the bridge, the Dalek Prime Strategist arrived and attempted to bargain with the Doctor to escape in his TARDIS. He played along, but exposed the deal to the Dalek Time Commander on the bridge, resulting in the Prime Strategist killing the Time Commander. In the ensuing in-fighting among the Daleks, the Doctor and Tiska were able to escape in the TARDIS. (

Tamasan infiltrated the enclave and planted a bomb, which the Doctor used as leverage so the Strategist would allow him to contact Bliss and Rasmus, telling them to abandon Davros to the advancing Daleks. As the Doctor expected, the Emperor arrogantly had Davros brought before him, leading to a schism amongst the assembled Daleks and a brief rebellion against the Emperor.

The avian natives of the planet took him from his ship and explained to him that their leader was dying. The Doctor operated on their leader with

   Indeed, the Big Finish situation was particularly favourable to McGann, as their license with the
   British Broadcasting Corporation
   did not allow them to use any incarnations of the Doctor who originated from
   BBC Wales
   series. Consequently, McGann was their "current" Doctor, even as late as
   2015
   . They therefore made him effectively the "first amongst equals," making his adventures ongoing and eventually giving him his own series. Unlike the other Doctors, most of his Big Finish releases were deliberately organised into "seasons" and his annual output was typically greater than that afforded to the others. Effectively, he has so far had four series of narratively-connected seasons — one featuring
   Charlotte Pollard
