He tracked him down together with Jovanovic, but he was surprised and ambushed by him: it was actually Jovanovic who had taken control of a dispersed and alone Cyberman, whose humanity was resurfacing. Jovanovic intended to use him to stop the production of a movie he felt "unpatrioctic", because it promoted peace. The Doctor was able to break Jovanovic's grip on the Cyberman, and disabled him out of pity after they watched together the finished film. (

   The Doctor and Rose travelled to the site of Rose's estate before it was built in
   1966
   London. They discovered someone had been changing history, and a housing development called
   Brandon Mews
   had been built on the estate's future, even though there should have been nothing there except fields. The Doctor went to a pub to check

   While the Doctor learnt from
   Charlotte Cobb
   that her husband,
   Peter Cobb
   , had mysteriously died after being followed by Lend-a-Hand girls, Rose went to
   Lend-a-Hand House
   and found that humans were also being converted into Lend-a-Hand girls. Travelling to Lend-a-Hand House, the Doctor discovered the
   Kustollon
   Igrix
   had travelled back in time, and planned to use Lend-a-Hand girls, initially made up of female humans, but later including biotechnology grown from Kustollon genestuff, to alter history so that humanity would be given whatever they desire and never venture out into space, and consequently never win a battle between Earth and
   Kustollia
   in
   3046
   . Igrix' first major step was to destroy
   the Moon
   in 1966, preventing any staging post from which to break out into space. With the help of Peter's work on
   DNA
   resequencing, the Doctor created a virus containing genetic instructions from Rose in the form of perfume, which Rose threw at the Lend-a-Hand girls, making them humans with human instructions.

   The Doctor and Rose climbed to the top of the
   Post Office Tower
   to stop Igrix using his spaceship to fire at the Moon. The Doctor did this by spraying the human virus at his biotech ship. The ship refused to take orders from Igrix and flew into space to explore and spend some "quality time" with Igrix. Setting history back on course, the Doctor used his sonic screwdriver to destroy the housing development, and make them start over and build Rose's future home. (

The Doctor fixed the nanogenes' mistakes by comparing the DNA of the child and Nancy, who was his mother, restoring the infected zombies to normal. Jack stopped the bomb from hitting the bombsite by placing it in stasis inside his warship and when everyone got to safety, the Doctor destroyed the ambulance, making sure that history said that a bomb hit that location. The Doctor rescued Jack from his Chula warship just before it exploded, taking him aboard the TARDIS as his latest companion. (

The four Doctors concocted a plan to allow every incarnation of their TARDIS to speak with the Type 1, persuading it to jettison all it consumed and close up the white holes. Arriving back on Earth, the Ninth Doctor agreed to take Jenny back home and return his eighth, tenth, and eleventh incarnations and their companions back to their respective TARDISes. (

   heart of the TARDIS

Knowing his fight against the Daleks was suicidal, the Doctor sent a reluctant Rose back home in the TARDIS, while he and Jack gathered a possible resistance consisting of gameshow contestants and operatives.

Before his arrival "a number of strange incidents'" had been happening where there had been fights between the staff and their wards. After a week of incarceration, where the Doctor easily escaped sedation and capture, he vanished. Richard had "no idea" how the Doctor escaped, but suspected a connection between his escape and the disappearance of the psychiatric ward's head, Dr Sirius Drake, and a "mysterious fire" that destroyed Dr Drake's private quarters and laboratory the same night. He warned to be aware of him and not to trust or follow him.

    was for the Ninth Doctor to be the one who fought in the Time War, as hinted throughout his era. However,
    Steven Moffat
    admitted that he had difficulty with this since the Ninth Doctor is clearly "a new man" at the beginning of his adventures with Rose. (He makes several comments about his physical appearance upon looking in a mirror, indicating that he has recently regenerated and not yet gotten used to his appearance.) Though Christopher Eccleston enjoyed his time as the Ninth Doctor, he declined a part in the 50th-anniversary special. When Eccleston turned down the offer to return, as Moffat thought that he would, the character of the War Doctor was created to take his place. Moffat later explained Eccleston's reasons for passing on the reprisal in an interview:
   </li>

   <p key="00ba2e8f-a7b7-4d77-8e62-12e2b2fe7f0b">
    I sort of knew that he wouldn't. I know Chris a bit. I did a couple of meetings, and there was a moment, I suppose, a giddy moment where [I thought] 'Would he actually do it?' This wasn't the kind of decision he took in a funk or that he was cross. He was very measured, very kind, very gentlemanly about it. He's a good bloke. If you look at Chris's career, this is not what he does. The Ninth Doctor turns up for the battle and not the party.
