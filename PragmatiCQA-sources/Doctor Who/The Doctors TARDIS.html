   According to one account, the Ships on the Homeworld were born from
   the Matrix
   , whom they referred to as Mother. As part of a secret plan, Mother also conceived two hybrid offspring, twin sisters who were only half-Ship. When the time came for them to choose their Homeworlder pilots,
   one
   chose "

It claimed while the Doctor had not built the TARDIS from scratch, he had substantially modified/rebuilt it.

   The

   of the Doctor's TARDIS was the space in which the operation of the craft was usually affected. It was dominated by a large, hexagonal console, typically in or near the middle of the room. The room held a
   scanner
   for viewing the outside and offered immediate access to the exterior through a set of doors. According to one source, the trip from the console room to the outside required the passenger to step through the
