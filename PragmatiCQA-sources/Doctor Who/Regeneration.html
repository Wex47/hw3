   Rassilon had been investigating a method of regenerating decayed and diseased tissue via a series of self-replicating, biogenic molecules. The
   cells
   of a
   Gallifreyan
   body would be repaired, restored and re-organised, resulting in a wholly new physical form. The
   brain
   cells would also be rearranged, though to a lesser extent; the new incarnation would retain the
   memories
   of the former incarnation, though the
   personality
   of the Time Lord could change, the degree of this change depending upon the Time Lord in question. Rassilon intended this mechanism only for the

   Postar the Perfidious
   's
   Scrolls of Gallifrey
   , according to which Rassilon was the first Time Lord to gain regeneration as an unintended side effect of his work with the
   Eye of Harmony
   : the elemental forces to which he had been exposed as he worked on stabilising the Eye caused the death of his original body, but granted him
   a set of twelve regenerations
   . Upon reshaping Time Lord society to his designs, Rassilon then gave a select number of Gallifreya aristocrats the privilege of gazing upon the Eye unveiled, thus granting them twelve regenerations each as well.
   Morbius
   would later partially base his campaign for the Presidency on the promise of extending the same generosity to all Gallifreyans. (

   Sam Jones

   Daniel Joyce
   dismissed this theory for blonde Sam's existence as impossible as the Doctor could never have had that degree of unintentional influence on a complete stranger, although he admitted that the basic concept of Time Lord biodata rewriting another person's biodata wasn't completely impossible if there was greater pre-existing contact between them.

While technically frozen in time, Vassarian revealed that he had lost so much energy through the Sontarans' actions that he would be unable to regenerate. The War Doctor helped him end his life so that the Sontarans would be destroyed by the Daleks. (

   the TARDIS
   "the Ship"), and how he looked wearing the
   sonic sunglasses
   . He was, nonetheless, incredibly embarrassed by his original incarnation's occasional
   sexist
   remarks. The First Doctor's reaction to his future was much less warm; he was dismayed at learning the Twelfth Doctor played the
   electric guitar
   , and disappointed in the Twelfth Doctor's lacklustre treatment of their TARDIS (deeming the new decoration "hideous" and expressing dismay at the dirtiness of the console room, which he attributed to the absence of
   Polly Wright
   , who, in his days, cleaned the TARDIS for him). He also criticised the Twelfth Doctor's over-reliance on technology over his own intellect, and his need to always boast about his plans. As a whole, the First Doctor was, at first, horrified to learn he would eventually become a "Doctor of War". However, he grew to admire his future self, believing their actions were for the greater good rather than malicious purposes as he initially believed. (

   Straxus
   learned that he would become the insane

However, despite his disgust at Kotris's actions, Straxus only made a few half-hearted efforts to kill himself to avoid becoming Kotris which were prevented by a drone Kotris had sent, until the final confrontation between the two incarnations culminated in Straxus being exterminated as even the Daleks were disgusted with his selfishness.

Although he later claimed that he had targeted his past self at a point when he knew that the younger Master would survive, the two Masters found it difficult to cooperate, as the younger Master was more serious and dedicated to ensuring victory where the future Master's new lease on life had left him more inclined to make various bad jokes as he taunted his enemies. The older Master noted that the Cult's plans to remake the universe had been inspired by the beliefs of the renegade Time Lord known as the Heretic, whose belief that the universe was sick, led him to perceive regeneration as the only cure for this 'illness'.

    , I went along to this screening in LA and journalists put their hands up, and one of the first questions was, "What will happen when he reaches the thirteenth regeneration?" There's a fascinating academic study to be made out of how some facts stick and some don't – how Jon Pertwee's Doctor could say he was
    thousands of years old
    , and no-one listens to that, and yet someone once says he's only got thirteen lives, and it becomes lore. It's really interesting, I think. That's why I'm quite serious that that 507 thing won't stick, because the 13 is too deeply ingrained in the public consciousness. But how? How did that get there?
