   DNA
   , and was conceived by her parents,
   Amy Pond
   and
   Rory Williams
   , aboard the TARDIS as it travelled through the
   Time Vortex
   . She was then raised and conditioned by
   the Silence
   , who used her unique DNA to transform her into the first of several
   Proto-Time Lords
   , granting her great strength, a deep understanding of the complex principles of
   time
   and
   space
   , and the ability to regenerate. She loved the Doctor dearly, and shared a long-lasting relationship with them. River was one of the very few people who knew
   the Doctor's true name
   .

   Melody was stolen from her parents as a newborn baby by
   Madame Kovarian
   , to become a
   weapon
   of the Silence in their crusade against the Doctor. After a later regeneration, she killed the

  <p key="7bcbe7d6-a7d4-4151-9906-afd2083c1c8f">
   The Doctor and her parents left her to make her own way in the
   universe
   . With no connection to her family or the Silence, River became an
   archaeologist
   , ostensibly to track the Doctor through time. She crossed the Doctor's path on several occasions, across many of their incarnations, and generally with the result that she was meeting them at progressively earlier points in
   their own time stream
   . Hoping to avoid
   temporal paradoxes
   , the Eleventh Doctor gave her
   a diary
   to keep track of their meetings and to prevent her from revealing "
   spoilers
   " to him about his own future.
  </p>
  <p key="282c57eb-a4fb-44b2-b637-2a3d52abde69">
   Again forced by the Silence, she made a second attempt on the Eleventh Doctor's life, which led to their eventual marriage. Though actually unsuccessful, she was convicted of his
   murder
   and spent many years in
   Stormcage Containment Facility
   for it — to convince the universe and the Silence that her
   husband
   actually was dead. This confinement was made more bearable by escaping frequently to go out on dates with the Doctor. She was eventually
   pardoned
   , due to the Doctor deleting any evidence of his existence, and became a
   Professor
   of
   Archaeology
   .

Melody then agreed to give a message to River Song from the dying Doctor, and he whispered it in her ear. Asking who River was, Amy had the

   When a mysterious planet appeared out of nowhere, a message was sent to the
   Luna University
   , requesting the aid of its most eminent archaeologists. River accepted the message and went there with a class of students, where they found a tomb apparently untouched by scavengers. As they opened it, though, they found that
   Bernice Summerfield
   was already in it: she arrived first upon receiving the same message as River, recognising that it came from the Doctor. Minutes later, the

   Matrix
   was still active, and that the Doctor and Ria had the power to access it and control it. The arrival of another troop of scavengers then prompted the Doctor to use the powers of the Matrix not only to protect the ruins, but also to rebuild Gallifrey; River then encouraged him to do so, to make himself a
   god
   , thus snapping him out of his delusion. By then, she and Benny had already worked out that the planet was not really Gallifrey, but instead the ruins of a TARDIS, which projected the illusion of Gallifrey by connecting with the mind of the Doctor. The Doctor then reprogrammed it to dispel any illusion after he, River and Benny had gone. River and the Doctor stood hand in hand and watched Gallifrey disappear, before leaving. (

   ' invasion of New York. During this time she went by the alias "Melody Malone." She was there for at least a month before a man named
   Rock Railton
   hired her to investigate what he feared to be a murder plot against him involving "the kiss of an angel." The following day, while attending a
   Starlight Studios
   party, she encountered an old man claiming to be Rock Railton, but believed him to be a bum. When she encountered the man she recognised as Rock, he had no memory of their meeting in her office the previous day.

   After dealing with two thugs that were hired to kill her, River returned to her office only to receive a call from head of Starlight Studios,
   Max Kliener
   . She agreed to meet him at his studio the next afternoon, where she was reintroduced to Rock, who claimed to remember their prior meeting. However, River knew he was lying when she asked about giving him coffee and he pretended to remember this although it never happened. She also noted that
   Giddy Semestre
   , Rock's co-star, also did not remember meeting her the day before at the party.
  </p>
  <p key="49180d4d-d6a8-46a6-b9df-9820022d1ad7">
   Max then led River down a block from the main studio and revealed to her a room full of giant bell jars filled with what appeared to be clones of Rock Railton, Giddy Semestre, and of Max's bodyguard,
   Hank Sissy
   . Max explained that they were not clones so much as everyday people who had had their flesh redistributed in their bodies to make them look identical to their template bodies. To do this, he had used "the kiss of an angel." The duplicates did not live very long, however, and were in fact growing old and dying out faster and faster because the Weeping Angel he was using to create his duplicates was growing stronger and therefore absorbing more and more of the victims' energy. Max planned to transform River into a copy of Giddy Semestre, but River
   kissed
   him using her
   hallucinogenic lipstick
   and managed to escape by killing the Hank copies and pushing Max into the arms of his Weeping Angel, who kissed him and turned him to dust.

   As River was reversing the process to turn the other transformed victims back into themselves and escort them to safety, she was unaware that the Weeping Angel was being stolen from behind the curtain it was sitting behind via an escape hole that had been cut into the wall. She returned in time to see a van speeding off, presumably with the Angel inside. (

   After River's run-in with Max Kliener and his Angel, River met her husband in Manhattan, along with her parents.
   Rory
   was sent back in time to 1938 New York City by one of the Angels and met River.
   Amy
   and the Doctor had difficulty following him since all the time energy the Angels had consumed made time travel difficult. With the help of a Chinese
   vase
   as "landing lights", they managed to get through but found River trapped in the grip of one of the Angels; she had to break her wrist in order to escape and the Doctor used up some of his regeneration energy to fix it. Rory was locked in a
   cellar
   with a group of baby Weeping Angels but instead of sending him back in time, they just sent him to
   Winter Quay
   . When River, Amy and the Doctor found Rory, they also found an older version of him, dying in a bed. After that they heard loud thumps, made by the
   Statue of Liberty
   , which had become a Weeping Angel.

   With the Angels closing in, River, her husband and her parents were forced to flee towards the roof and got separated on the way up. The Statue of Liberty was waiting for them and Rory and Amy decided to sacrifice themselves and create a paradox which would poison the Angels food source and kill them. River and the Doctor watched in horror as Amy and Rory threw themselves off the roof, and the paradox killed all the Angels except one, which somehow managed to survive.

  <p key="e08ce2ba-4b52-4122-be9d-76e93fc63e62">
   The group found themselves in a graveyard that had a gravestone with Rory's name on it. As they were preparing to leave, the surviving Weeping Angel ambushed them and sent Rory back in time. Because of the paradox, and all the poisoned time energy, the Doctor couldn't take the TARDIS back to find him. Amy decided to allow the Angel to touch her so that she could be with Rory. After a tearful goodbye to River and the Doctor, Amy turned away from the Angel and allowed it to touch her so that she could live with Rory for the rest of her life.

   The devastated Doctor asked River to travel with him. River said she would go with him anywhere, but "not all the time", as there was "only room for one psychopath" on the TARDIS. Under the name "Melody Malone", River went upstairs to write
   the book
   that led the Doctor to 1930s New York and said that she would get Amy to write the afterword when she sent it to her for publishing, in hopes that the Doctor would listen to Amy. (

   and brought him to River by mistake. River did not recognise the Doctor in this incarnation. River brought the Doctor to Hydroflax, as part of a ruse to steal the diamond from his head. The Doctor repeatedly tried to tell her who he was, but she did not understand what he was saying. Hydroflax revealed himself to be a cyborg and discovered River's deception, removing his own head in the process. River and the Doctor snatched the head and escaped via teleport to a location near the TARDIS. River discovered the TARDIS and decided to take it for a ride without the Doctor's knowledge, indicating she had done it before. After a brief scuffle which trapped Hydroflax's body in the TARDIS with them, River and the Doctor piloted the TARDIS to the

   Aboard the ship, with Hydroflax's body sealed in a cargo hold, River attempted to sell the diamond-studded head. Eventually,
   Scratch
   arrived to buy the diamond, but then revealed himself and every other person in the restaurant to be Hydroflax devotees. A fight ensued, during which Hydroflax's head was ultimately vaporised by the body. After Hydroflax's body decided to seek out the Doctor's head as a replacement, River came under questioning as to his location. To buy time by "keeping them talking", River claimed to Hydroflax's body that while she loved the Doctor, the Doctor didn't love her back, and he wouldn't be stupid or sentimental enough to come rescue her. River then realised who the Doctor was, and quickly revealed to him that a meteor storm was about to strike the ship and kill everyone and she planned her position perfectly. As the storm struck the ship, the floor broke under River and the Doctor, dropping them to a lower floor, and breaking the standoff.

   The ship descended, with River and the Doctor unable to bring it under control. As they argued about who would save the ship from crashing into the planet
   Darillium
   , they realised they were seconds from crashing and fled into the TARDIS. The TARDIS shielded them from the crash, but the impact knocked River out.

   The Doctor had regained consciousness first, emerged from the TARDIS on Darillium, and using the diamond, inspired a man called
   Alphonse
   to start a restaurant, so he could travel into the future and book a reservation for a balcony view of the Singing Towers. Dressing formally for River when she awakened, the Doctor gifted her with a sonic screwdriver of her own. River expressed concern about the stories saying that this would be their last date, but the Doctor had accepted that their time must come to an end. The Doctor told River that nights on Darillium lasted 24 years and the two enjoyed the view.

   In the 51st century, River led Strackman Lux and her team into
   the Library
   to learn what had happened there a hundred years earlier. A cryptic message had been sent: "4022 saved. No survivors." Expecting trouble, she contacted the Doctor by
   psychic paper
   . The version of the Doctor who turned up, again in his tenth incarnation, had not yet met her. Bewildered, he agreed to help and discovered the Library was infested with a swarm of

   CAL
   would reset the computer and stop the countdown to the Library's autodestruct after it had been activated, but also sacrifice the Doctor's own life. River knocked the Doctor out, handcuffed him and took his place. She pleaded with him to not change their history, not a moment of what had or would come for them. She realised he had always known this was coming. The Doctor began to babble questions  but River merely smiled, said, "Spoilers", and died as the autodestruct countdown was stopped.

River would take care of Donna's two virtual children and Charlotte Abigail Lux (the girl wired into the mainframe) in the virtual world, reading out her diary of her many adventures with the Doctor and how sometimes "everybody lives" when the Doctor came to call.

   When Clara and the Doctor arrived at a gravestone bearing River's name in Trenzalore, Clara again saw the echo of River, which guided her.

   After Clara entered the Doctor's time stream, River tried to stop him from following her, even though she believed that he could not see her. When she went to slap him however, the Doctor caught her hand and explained that he had been able to see her all along, and they shared a
   kiss
   . The Doctor told River that her time had passed and she should stop clinging to him as an echo; without disputing this, River requested that the Doctor say goodbye to her but he didn't know how, so she said the only goodbye she would accept was one where he would see her later. Right after the Doctor granted her request, she revealed that she was mentally linked to Clara, and would not still exist if Clara had died. When he asked how Clara could be alive, she said, "Spoilers!" and her last words to him in this encounter were, "Goodbye Sweetie." River's incorporeal form faded away. To the Paternoster Gang, the Doctor had appeared to passionately kiss thin air. (
