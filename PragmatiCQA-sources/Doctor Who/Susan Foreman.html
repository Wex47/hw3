When the Doctor was able to reach for the button marked "flight stabiliser", Susan collapsed shortly after the engines were stabilised. The Doctor tended to Susan as she slept, and used his jacket as a makeshift pillow for her before she reawakened. Susan then explored the TARDIS as the Doctor tended to the ship's controls. She tripped over a rigger's work case and brought it back to the Doctor when the TARDIS had run out of power. Inside the work case, the Doctor found an

   According to one account, the Doctor and Susan's first destination was a
   vivarium
   beneath the surface of the Moon. Before walking outside, they were confronted by Quadrigger
   Stoyn
   , who had become an unwitting passenger and had part of his face burned when the TARDIS took off. Stoyn's job was to take apart the TARDIS' engines before it was sent to be vaporised, but the TARDIS had run out of power, stranding them. The Doctor took the
   dematerialisation circuit
   so Stoyn wouldn't leave them behind and they explored the strange location. The Doctor, Susan and Stoyn were taken out of the tank and realised they were in a massive cavern filled with vivariums carefully-preserved specimens. The
   Archaeons
   had been seeding primitive planets such as the

   While checking to see if the TARDIS was a threat, the Archaeons began taking it apart. They took the TARDIS'
   temporal stasis capacitor
   while it was still attached to the power source. This caused the
   stasis field
   to breach, freezing the Doctor, Susan, Stoyn and the Archaeons in time, allowing the TARDIS to recharge itself. 450 million years later,

   According to one account, the Doctor and Susan learnt about the Earth's history through a "
   first contact
   induction video" Susan had been provided while on board the rover. With the dematerialisation circuit still in the Doctor's possession, the Archaeons had sent
   nematodes
   , which didn't affect the Time Lords, to kill all of the humans on the rover. When the Archaeons, found the life they had "seeded" had become disorderly and "run rampant", no longer matching their carefully-planned vision, they "purged" the humans on the lunar base and on the Earth with
   lightning
   . The Doctor, who was blamed for the disruption of the Archaeons' experiments, was brought back to the cavern. Meanwhile, the humans retaliated against the Archaeons with
   missiles
   . After the Doctor went inside the TARDIS, evading the distracted Archaeons, Stoyn tried taking Susan with him, but she refused and ran inside the TARDIS.

   With the dematerialisation circuit in place, the Doctor and Susan left without Stoyn, as the Doctor felt that he was just as willing to abandon them. Another barrage of missiles breached the
   atmosphere
   of the Archaeons' cavern, destroying their weaponry; the Archaeons were pulled outside, though Susan saw Stoyn struggle to reach the rover. Afterwards, the Doctor continuously watched the video about the Earth's history and evolution inside the TARDIS, marvelling at the planet's abundance. He promised it would be his next destination. Instead, his next stop was a place with a blue sun and air like wine. It took several trips before he reached the Earth again. (

   The Doctor soon learned the residents were besieged by fox-like aliens who could disintegrate and reconstitute their bodies. Taking him inside their compound, the humans stripped him of his clothes and burned them, citing possible contamination by the "foxes". They gave him new clothes drawn from their own supply. This meant that he was now wearing the garb of a doctor. When they assumed that he was sent by Earth to help them, he agreed. Not wishing to give them his real name, he referenced his new clothes to derive a title: "the Doctor".

   He agreed to help them with their "fox problem" if they would help him find his granddaughter.

Susan went with him and somehow survived, implying there was more than Gallifreyan genetics in her heritage. The Doctor was only successful in this effort because Ace sacrificed herself by blowing up the Lobri and herself with
   Nitro-9
   . Grieving the loss of Ace, the Doctor wiped Sarah and Peri's minds of the event and returned them to their proper times. Susan was returned to the side of her grandfather as they walked back to Totter's Lane after the incident. (

   At

   that October, Susan and sixth form student
   Cedric Chivers
   heard a DJ on the radio read a message to them from a future incarnation of the Doctor saying "it's blowing in the wind," and "it's all in the beat". The following day, a mob of Coal Hill students and bikers attacked and chased Susan. The following day, while crossing

   Rook

The Doctor deduced the workings of the weapon and devised a means of using Susan's radio and other pieces in the warehouse to transmit a blocking signal that negated the effect of the weapon. To buy the Doctor more time, Susan used her psychic powers to slow down the oncoming mob. After his life was saved, Rook decided against coercing the Doctor and Susan to fight in the war and told them that their "secret" would be safe. Afterwards, Susan received a premonition of something coming for the Doctor in his future that he couldn't escape. (

Whilst there she was suspected of being a traitor to the revolution and was sentenced to death. On the way to their execution, Susan and Barbara were rescued. However, in the protection of her rescuers, she became ill and learned how primitive medicine was in revolutionary France. The Physician that treated her reported her as an escaped prisoner. Back at the prison, and the Doctor facilitated her second escape, by impersonating an official. (

When the travellers were all reunited, the Master showed them how he was able to move across time and brought them twelve years into the future, during a war between Reena's people and the
   Dalmari
   , the original people of the planet. To force the Doctor to hand over his
   TARDIS key
   , he threw Susan and the others into the war zone. Susan managed to reunite with Reena, and together they stopped her mother,
   Tanna
   , from bombing the town to stop the Dalmari. She later reunited with the Doctor and was stranded with him when the Master left in the TARDIS. She helped her grandfather to take control of the Master's servers, which he used to stop the fighting and bring the two people to a peace. She then convinced the Doctor to stay on Destination and help them to find an agreement to live together. The Doctor left her in the Master's laboratory with Reena, after setting the controls so that they would travel two years into the future, as he stayed behind and helped the people on Destination. By that time, Ian and Barbara managed to take back control of the TARDIS and bring it back to Destination, so that the travellers were then able to leave. (

   Susan escaped using the orange liquid, and wandered through the tunnels under the hospital, when she came across
   Victor

Reunited with David at the Dalek ship, Susan used more liquid to further Victor's healing process and restore his memory, thus finding out that Bray collaborated with the Daleks during the invasion. Susan confronted Bray and revealed his treachery to the public, ruining his election, and then foiled his attempt to call the Daleks and cause another invasion. David asked her whether she wanted to leave Earth using the Dalek ship, but she refused and destroyed it, choosing to remain on Earth. (

   the Master
   whilst investigating activity in a Dalek Artefact. Captured by him to use as a hostage against the Doctor, she hid from him that she was a relation of the Doctor and member of both Renegades' own species, instead claiming she was simply a former human companion of his.

   During a brief four-way confrontation between David, Susan, the Doctor and the Master, Susan saw David sacrifice himself to save the Doctor from a shot by the Master. Her spirits momentarily crushed, Susan let herself be taken by the Master into
   his TARDIS
   as he made his escape to the planet
   Tersurus
   . However, waking from her torpor, she revealed to him that she was also a Time Lord, startling the Master, and then used her own psychic abilities combined with the TARDIS's telepathic circuits to attack the Master's mind with a destructive mental attack that chipped away at the Master's mind, leaving him half-mad with only force of will and hatred to drive him.

   Although she planned to simply strand the mentally-damaged Renegade stranded on Tersurus, he refused to give up the
   matter transmuter
   he'd stolen from the Daleks, forcing her to shoot it with the Master's own TCE while he was still holding the transmuter. The blast severely damaged the Master in a way which Susan knew would prevent him from regenerating even if he still had any regenerations left; consequently believing him dead, she left in his TARDIS, setting the controls to a random location. With nothing left to hold her down on Earth, she once again became a wandering exile, much like she and the Doctor had been when she'd first travelled with him. She had no intention of letting the Time Lords know where she was, let alone returning to Gallifrey, as she assumed that the "very good reasons" which had led her and her grandfather to make their escape all those years ago had likely not changed since then.
