   Arriving on a space station, the Doctor and Amy encountered a expedition of nuns who were exploring the station due to exotic particles emanating from it and searching for a previous expedition. The Doctor discovered the station had a malfunctioning time engine onboard which caused time acceleration which had aged the last expedition. Discovering a jungle suddenly growing, they discovered the TARDIS was the source and that  Cosette,
   a resident
   of Hawkshaw and a Shasarak were trapped within the outer shell. Due to the time acceleration the three suddenly coalesded into a massive single creature which was expelled from the TARDIS, enabling the Doctor to enter it and figure out that the TARDIS had been infected since Planet Basingstoke. The Doctor helped the ageing nuns contain the creature in a teleport booth, and learnt they were fighting a war with robots,
   Galateans

   Bridget

This caused Chiyoko’s human empathy to resurface and she wept for what she had done, so the Doctor embraced her. She un-made her own creation, causing the Museum’s timeline to cease to exist. The Doctor brought the TARDIS to them and they escaped, though Chiyoko was dying due to never existing. Travelling back to the activation of the Galateans, the Doctor arranged a peaceful co-existence between them and humanity, with the help of Alan showing them the disastrous outcome if they fought, and arranged for Chiyoko’s consciousness to be uploaded to a Galatean body so she could continue living.

After saying goodbye to Sarah Jane and Jo, the Doctor set off for new adventures on his own. (

The Doctor gave the alien a choice, pointing out the alien's fusion engines would destroy everything in a twenty-mile radius if he activated them. After the alien shot energy at the Doctor, in the confusion, Louie placed the device in the alien's equipment. The device broke the link with the Guy Fawkeses and reversed the fear-consuming's effects, draining energy from the alien, as it withered to dust. (

Zzagner wondered if he was any good, which led Alice and the Doctor to

Alice and Jones then travelled through the gate, finding nothing but lights, while Jones recovered from his illness.

Using her memories of her mother's passing, Alice convinced the Chief Executive to accept what he had done and take back control of himself. Alice's words transformed the Chief Executive back into the Doctor, and the return of his memories caused the Entity to overload, destroying the city and apparently killing the Talent Scout.

The resulting paradox flung the Doctor outside into space, knocked out of phase with the rest of reality and into a non-corporeal state. In this state, the Doctor witnessed the Talent Scout stun the Entity in the past, causing the fraction of ARC to break away.

   Escaping another pursuit by the Then and the Now, the Doctor hoped to show Alice the true nature of the Master by bringing her to one of the many places in the universe where his influence could still be felt. They arrived on a planet in the midst of a battle between the
   Sontaran High Command
   and a breakaway legion of
   Sontarans
   . The breakaway legion had encountered
   the Master
   and had come to view him as a god, notably adapting a faction goatee in celebration of his legacy. The Doctor's team also encountered a
   Rassilonian Timefly
   , an endangered species which were used to create
   Chronal tumours
   . Leaving the suicide-detonated-planet, the Doctor deduced that the Master had been responsible for his framing and that they could find
   his TARDIS
   to get the evidence. He brought his companions to Stormcage Prison to collect River for her assistance in getting it. (

   The Doctor and his companions went into space so that the Doctor could regain the information of the location of the Master's TARDIS from a Stargate, as he had wiped his memory of the place. Fighting off another attack from the Then and the Now, they arrived in the location:
   Shada
   , the Time Lord prison planet. As the Then and the Now attacked the security robots, the group ventured into the prison's Black Vault, where the Doctor, Alice, Daak and River were attacked by the security system and put into stasis. The Squire, however, was immune to the effects as she was a time anomaly, and she freed them. The group finally found the Master's TARDIS, where upon checking his log, the Doctor determined that he was not responsible for his framing. (

   Feeling renewed responsibility for Overcast, the Doctor brought his companions to a bar on
   Clundanius XI
   for drinks. River revealed to Alice that the Then and the Now had been tracking them using a chrono-tracker it had shot into her neck, a fact the Doctor had declined to tell her. She proposed they leave Alice behind to avoid the pursuits, but the Doctor refused. The group were forced to flee the bar anyway once the Then and the Now arrived, and, in the confusion, were forced to leave the Squire behind. Daak informed the Doctor of the
   Volatix Cabal
   , a secret Dalek society that disappeared from the Time War before its end, and Alice suggested they could have left records important for their case. However, River realised that the Malignant had found them, (

   Hastily escaping its clutches, the Doctor found that the infection was attempting to corrupt River's timeline. He put her into a cyrobooth to protect her, alongside Taiyan's body. The group arrived on
   Lujhimene
   , another planet affected by the Time War, to find information on the Volatix Cabal. Alice suffered another influx of mysterious memories. The Then and the Now tracked them to Lujhimene and begun forcing the Doctor through his previous incarnations, before the Squire returned to combat it, having acquired new weaponry in her absence. She heavily wounded the Then and the Now, but it shot her with energy, mortally wounding her. As the Doctor nursed the Squire, Alice and Daak decided to investigate the Cabal themselves, and activated the chronal tumour in the Master's TARDIS to use it. However, Alice decided she alone was the liability due to the Then and the Now tracking her, and she shot Daak and left in the Master's TARDIS alone. (

   When the

   Rassilon
   to take over history, the Doctor and Alice were confronted by
   Cyber-Silurians
   on prehistoric Earth, where they had travelled to collect some fruit for
   Jenny Flint

As the situation grew worse, the Doctor sent Alice back to the TARDIS for her safety as he snuck into the Cyberman compound, believing himself safe from the Cybermen due to them being unable to convert Time Lords, but was quickly proven incorrect. Locked within a conversion pod, the Doctor conversed with the
   Cyberiad
   , and learnt that Alice was unable to enter the TARDIS, as its power had been stolen away. Determined to save his friend, the Doctor channelled his mental powers into the network, with his emotions freeing the Silurians from Cyber-control. Though the Doctor believed this to be the end to the Cybermen's plan, the Cyberiad simply terminated the Silurians and launched the Cyber-Arks itself, only for everything to revert back to normal. Still able to remember the events when everyone else forgot, the Doctor contemplated what had happened while back in the TARDIS. (

The Doctor learnt Jex had experimented on his people to create living weapons to win a long war, and became Mercy's doctor in repentance.

Accepting a high noon duel, the Doctor distracted Tek while Jex escaped to his ship. Jex, feeling guilt for the experiments he conducted, committed suicide by blowing up his ship, and the Doctor talked Tek out of self-destructing, instead having him become the new protector of Mercy.

He found a message from Amy saying she and Rory loved him and had lived a long and happy life. She asked him to go back in time and tell her younger self of their adventures, as well as to find a new companion. (

   Investigating a

   battleship in orbit around 1960s Earth, the Doctor discovered Captain
   Gol Clutha
   and his army had killed the Sontarans who inhabited the battleship. Involving himself in their war with
   Cornucopia
   , the Doctor was transported to a dream world, where he was reunited with
   Ian Chesterton
   and
   Barbara Wright
   . After he helped them escape and located the TARDIS, the Doctor was met with distrust by Ian, who failed to believe he was "

    the Doctor

   Cornucopia
   , where they discovered the planet in ruins.

   When the Hunters of the Burning Stone attacked, the Doctor got their attention by claiming to possess the item they sought, allowing Ian to attack their leaders from behind, and finally convincing him that he really was the same man he once knew. Barbara was then kidnapped by
   Miss Ghost
   and the creators of the metal the hunters sought, the
   Prometheans
   , appeared. The Doctor demanded to know why he, Ian and Barbara had been brought to Cornucopia, to which the Prometheans replied that it was not the Doctor they needed, but Ian and Barbara. The Doctor and Ian escaped the Prometheans with the help of
   Horatio Lynk
   . Horatio took them to Miss Ghost's base, where they found a doll that the Doctor recognised. Horatio was then shot by
   Patrick Lake
   , a man the Doctor had previously encountered in
   20th century
   Prague
   . The Hunters then arrived and, referring to Ian as "teacher", removed their helmets to reveal themselves as the
   Tribe of Gum

   The Prometheans revealed that they visited primitive worlds and granted them the gift of their psychic metal, and that they had witnessed Ian, Barbara and the First Doctor's encounter with the Tribe of Gum, and given the tribe the psychic metal after the TARDIS departed. The Tribe became the Hunters, who travelled through time and space in search of more of the metal. The Doctor was shown Patrick's memories; shortly after a repelled
   Cyberman
   invasion in the early
   21st century
   , Patrick lobbied for a new branch of
   MI6
   , one dedicated to space travel and defence against alien threats, to be formed. He trained his daughter to become one of the branch's agents. The Doctor, realising the Prometheans were feeding on Patrick's psychic energy, shut down Patrick's conscious mind. The Prometheans turned on the Doctor, and sent him to relive his most terrifying memories, transporting him to the last day of the

   The Doctor was able to overcome the onslaught, and the memories changed to the moment during their time in prehistoric Earth, when Ian persuaded the First Doctor not to kill Za. The Doctor told Ian that he helped him to be better, and revealed that his first incarnation had been inspired by Ian and Barbara to take on more human companions. He also told Ian of the many deaths he brought about, particularly those of the Time War. Ian reassured the Doctor that he was a good person, and the two finally escaped the psychic realm. They then discovered that the Prometheans' craft was a "neural reverser", which the Prometheans used to regress humanity to the level of cavemen. The Doctor, Ian and Patrick were then picked up by Barbara and Patricia. Once onboard their ship, the Doctor admonished Patrick for turning his daughter into a weapon, with Patricia retorting that she was honouring her fallen mother, and telling the Doctor to think of a solution himself. When the Doctor was unable to, Ian encouraged him, and he suddenly hit on a plan, departing in the TARDIS. He arrived in
   1963
   , at
   Totters Lane
   , where he entered his first incarnation's TARDIS, and used his
   sonic screwdriver
   to break the TARDIS'
   chameleon circuit

   As the Tribe of Gum instructed the primitive humans to worship the Prometheans, the Doctor returned, having planted images of the TARDIS throughout human history, and using that image to alter the neural platform, reversing the effect, destroying the platform, and "locking" the minds of the human race from being altered again. Incensed, the Tribe of Gum, at the Prometheans' urging, attacked the Doctor. Ian and Barbara landed their ship on a fragment of the neural platform and convinced the Tribe to stop by telling them of love and sacrifice, and how the Doctor protected the people of Earth for years. When the Tribe of Gum ceased their assault, the Prometheans attacked Ian and Barbara. The Tribe of Gum then turned on the Prometheans. Both sides were destroyed in the ensuing struggle. The Doctor tried to shut down
   Hugo Wilding
   and Patrick Lake's MI6 organisation, but Hugo had information on the Doctor and threatened to upload it to every database in the universe and make the Doctor a popular figure again, which the Doctor had spent a long time trying to erase. After ensuring his existence was to remain shadowed, the Doctor attended Barbara and Ian's wedding as Ian's best man. (

Believing they were going to die, the Doctor admitted that he knew her two previous incarnations and demanded to know what she really was. Clara didn't understand anything, leading the Doctor to
   deduce
   to himself there couldn't be a connection.

The Doctor realised they needed to go back to the point of the disaster and activate the magno-grab remote, which had caused the burn marks on Clara's hand before, to stop the field and prevent the disaster. After he promised Clara that she wouldn't remember any of the events that had happened, the Doctor passed through a
   time rift
   to give the device to his past self. After instructing his past self to use the device, the Doctor disappeared back through the rift as time began to rewrite itself. After he pressed the button, the Doctor said aloud to Clara that two days had been compressed into the space of one, and asked Clara if she felt safe travelling with him, to which she responded positively.

The Doctor outbid everyone for the Kindred, but, unable to actually pay, he put the TARDIS up for auction so that the resulting bids would overflow the mainframe, allowing Clara to release the Kindred. However, the Doctor's victory was short when he failed to stop the sale of his TARDIS. It dematerialised, leaving him and Clara stranded. (

   The Doctor and Clara went to a Cornucopia airport to try to find their way home, where they witnessed a girl called Keli dissolve herself with a pill, bearing a triangular symbol on her hand. Meeting up with Amy Johnson and Horaito again, they learnt that the triangular symbol was the mark of Azrael, a necrotist who passed on his skills and memories through his mask. After learning Azrael was in possession of his TARDIS, the Doctor recruited Annabel Lake to help him find it after learning she and
   Danny Fisher
   had been hacking the Mainframe for information on bidders. With their help, the Doctor found that Azrael's winning bid came from the Halion Nebula, and the trio set off in a portal to Azrael's world, the Wasting Well, where they were caught in an explosion and knocked out when trying to track Azrael's location.

   However, when the Doctor and Annabel recovered, they learnt Danny was really Azrael, who had coated the TARDIS in the deadly Mercy energy and planned to use it to destroy Cornucopia, fuelled by his hatred of the Doctor and all aliens. Annabel finally forgave the Doctor for the past by freeing him and killing Danny. The Doctor grabbed the TARDIS as it took off and was able to convince it to come back to him and destroy the Mercy. He then parted ways with the Lake family on good terms and went to celebrate in a Cornucopian carnival with Clara, Amy and Horaito. (

However, before they could work out why they had been thrown together, the Doctors were arrested by the guards of Elizabeth I, who was apparently being impersonated by a Zygon, after the Eleventh Doctor gave instructions to Clara through the fissure. The three Doctors were imprisoned in the Tower of London, where the Eleventh Doctor inscribed numbers in the cell which would enable
   Jack Harkness' vortex manipulator

The Queen took them to show them that the Zygons put themselves into stasis in paintings to take over the planet at a future date and revealed herself to be the real Queen who was showing them so that they could defeat the Zygons in the future. She then married the reluctant Tenth Doctor, who left in the TARDIS with his past and future incarnations and Clara.

   Knowing he was to die, the Doctor hid in a
   Teselecta
   copy of himself to keep himself safe. He interacted with his companions through the Teselecta, and then was supposedly
   murdered
   by River Song safe inside the robot duplicate. His "body" was also supposedly burned, but both the real Doctor and the ship remained unscorched and unharmed. He used this to pretend as if he

   The Doctor once again used a copy of himself to battle against the
   Great Intelligence
   and its human slave
   Rosemary Kizlet
   , this time in the form of a
   Spoonhead
   . While still at a
   café
   controlling the Spoonhead remotely, the Doctor made his other self enter
   the Shard

   Kizlet's tablet
   to get
   Mahler
   to obey Kizlet's orders to release everyone. (
