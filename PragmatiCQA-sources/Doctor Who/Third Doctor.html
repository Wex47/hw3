   20th century
   for a significant period of his life, was a distinguished man of high class and gadgetry, often tinkering away and privy with machines. He also liked to share his wisdom with those who had open minds, but his patience would quickly dissolve if something annoyed him. Those who got on his good side soon found him to be a friendly fellow, while those who were against him soon found that this gentleman could actually get physical and hold his own in a fight.

   The technological limits of the time period, and the constraints of his exile, often made him frustrated and bitter. However, he retained his endearing compassion toward his

   ,
   the Master
   . Although appalled by the disregard for life inherent in the Master's schemes, the Doctor treated their relationship as somewhat of a friendly rivalry, even enjoying their battle of wits. The Master reflected an equally casual attitude back at him. The Doctor also held out hope that he could rehabilitate the Master, whom he had once considered a friend. Though the Master sometimes teamed up with the Doctor to deal with foes who threatened them, he always bent to dark and malicious desires, which kept their mutual antagonism alive. Indeed, when they did work together, they showed a mutual respect of each other's abilities. More than once, the Master did offer the Doctor the opportunity to share his power, but the Doctor always refused.

   In the field, the Doctor was aided by Sergeant
   John Benton
   , Captain
   Mike Yates
   , and Brigadier
   Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart
   . The Doctor often took exception to the Brigadier's military approach, just as the Brigadier was frequently irritated by the Doctor's air of superiority and seeming disregard for authority. Despite this, the two men ultimately developed an easy mutual trust and strong friendship.

   He was initially assisted in the laboratory by
   Dr Elizabeth Shaw
   . A capable scientist in her own right, she eventually left to pursue her own work, and the Doctor was given a new assistant,
   Jo Grant

   Clifford Jones

Liz later came to inform him that he was impersonated by one of the Mim so they could disable the Earth's defences and pave the way for their invasion. The Doctor asked for the Time Lords' help to deal with the Mim, as the destruction of the humans would damage the

   who could overturn the decision in favour of IMC. The Doctor had little choice but to play up to the Master's whims after a native alien tribe had stolen the TARDIS. He learned the Master's disguise was a ploy to reach a forgotten alien civilisation on Uxarieus, planning to seize the power of one of their weapons. However, the Doctor met the primitives' intelligent leader in the civilisation's city. Because it was intelligent, the Doctor reasoned with it, convincing the guardian to destroy the weapon and all traces of its civilisation before the Master could misuse the technology it held. The Master escaped to freedom. The Doctor reclaimed his TARDIS and left Uxarieus in the hands of a real Adjudicator. (

Having deduced its purpose, the Doctor threatened to use the device to strengthen the field to affect the Mileu, promptong them to retreat. Afterwards Jeremy confessed he’d spoken to the alien fugitive when he’d called the Damascus project earlier in the day. Furious the project was still operating despite his objections, the Doctor abandoned the Prime Minister on the beach. From this incident Jeremy decided that the Doctor's morality was dangerous and recorded a message stating that the Doctor must be stopped. (

   Grun
   instead. The Doctor won the match and spared Grun, since he was a simple and frightened soul at heart. However, delegate Arcturus revealed himself as a traitor working for

   Hepesh had refused to let Peladon join the Federation because he held fast to the old customs of the planet, which would soon be abandoned if an alliance changed the ways it was governed. He used Aggedor to kill
   Torbis
   , let Aggedor run wild through the citadel and cause chaos and framed the Ice Warriors as part of a bid to sabotage the delegation, creating dissent between all parties. The Doctor brought Aggedor to the Prince of Peladon so he would also learn of its presence, but Hepesh tried to command it to kill as its High Priest and appointed ruler. He intimidated Aggedor with a torch, thinking it would obey out of fear, but instead, it provoked Aggedor into fatally mauling him. With the traitors condemned, relations between the Federation and the Peladon Kingdom were improved. After the TARDIS had been heaved up the mountainside, the Doctor and Jo had to disembark immediately from Peladon when the real Earth delegate arrived and they were outed as impostors. (

His mind, however, was placed into a spare Tun body, and the Doctor stated that now he was a true "rock star". (

   . The Doctor landed his ship in an Earth cargo ship to avoid a collision, but could not properly speak to the crew, as Ogrons boarded it, making off with the TARDIS. Unfortunately, a strange noise caused the human crew to see the Ogrons as though they were Draconians, and they believed the Doctor and Jo had led them onto the ship as spies for Draconia. The two of them were imprisoned on Earth and were unable to convince their captors that they were innocent.

  <p key="6e2470e0-8ea7-4e40-a9af-e4d3fb4b24ca">
   The Doctor was sent to a penal colony on the Moon, where the Peace Party plotted an escape, while Jo was greeted by the Master, posing as a commissioner from
   Sirius IV
   and arranged for the release of the Doctor from the penal colony after intervening with a sabotage of the Peace Party's escape plot. They soon discovered that the Master was secretly working with the Ogrons to provoke the two sides into all-out war under the orders of the Daleks, using
   hypnosound
   technology to confuse them into thinking humans and Draconians were attacking each other. His plans to kidnap them failed when the ship violated Draconian territory, causing Draconians to seize control of it and bring the Doctor, Jo, and the Master to their home world to face judgement by their own emperor.

  <p key="e94bd92c-7749-4e46-9058-88c261db8d4e">
   Fortunately, the Doctor was able to convince the Draconian Emperor that they were being tricked into attacking humans. He sent the Doctor back to Earth with his son, the prince of Draconia, to convince the President of Earth they had been wronged, but the Master sent the Ogrons to attack them and they captured Jo. Unable to turn back because Earth and Draconia were on the brink of war, the Doctor continued to Earth and explained the deception to its President. He also had to reason with the unyielding
   General
   John Williams
   , who joined the expedition to the Ogron planet, and the group rescued Jo after she managed to resist the Master's hypnosound technology and radioed for help.

   The Master anticipated the arrival of the Doctor, having both the Ogrons and Daleks wait for their arrival. He captured the expedition group and promised the
   Gold Dalek
   that he would turn over the Doctor to the Daleks for extermination. Fortunately, Jo had pocketed the Master's hypnosound device, and the Doctor used it to frighten the Ogrons into thinking their Dalek masters were terrorising them. In this panic, the Master cornered the Doctor and Jo before they retrieved the TARDIS, pointing a blaster at the Doctor, firing the gun by accident when Ogrons overran him. Though Jo wrestled the gun from the Master as he was swept out of the room by their lumbering bodies, but his shot had grazed the Doctor's forehead and had badly wounded him.

   she found. He eventually found Jo alive and safe, learning that the Spiridons were a peaceful race forced into violence and experimentation by the Daleks. The group discovered a base with more than ten-thousand Daleks hibernating and buried deep in the ground, and the Doctor figured out they were vulnerable to extreme cold after noticing they slowed down during the nightfall that brought temperatures below freezing on Spiridon. The Daleks were eliminated by using the natural eruptions of liquid ice on Spiridon against them, liberating the Thals, the captive Spiridons, and removing the danger the Dalek army posed to other neighbouring races in the galaxy.

   As the Doctor prepared to return to Earth on Jo's request, the TARDIS was drawn to the planet Far, a planet on the far limits of Earth's empire, where the Doctor had once assisted in the construction of a hypergate to help ships travelling long distances. Discovering that the abandoned planet had a platoon of Daleks on it, the Doctor and Jo were separated when they tried to escape, the Doctor falling into an underground chamber while Jo met a member of the local resistance. The Doctor was able to make his way to a Dalek fuelling station run by human slaves who had suffered serious mutations due to exposure to the radioactive substances the Daleks used for fuel, where he met Jickster, the admiral who had once been in charge of Far's defences and was now the least twisted of the Dalek slaves. Jickster and the Doctor were able to steal a Dalek saucer and reactivate the hypergate, allowing them to escape and make contact with an Earth Alliance fleet. Talking with Jickster, the Doctor learned that the Daleks had two secret weapons on Far; a Dalek army in stasis, numbering over a million Daleks, and a giant transmitter that would broadcast a signal enabling the Daleks to turn the attacking Earth fleet into Robomen slaves en masse once they got into range. Although Jo was nearly forced to help set a trap for the Doctor, the Doctor managed to return to Far in his stolen saucer, accompanied by an Earth Alliance strike team. The Doctor managed to reprogram the robotisation weapon to target the Dalek army, with the overload of Dalek instructions causing them to self-destruct, with the Alliance fleet eliminating the rest.

This forced them into the wilderness with no means of technology, where they remained for so long it caused them to regress to more primitive ways and worship the city that destroyed them.

With Bellal's help, he sought to disrupt their city's functions and remove the power-disrupting facility, though it required him and the humans to infiltrate the city's defences and get through several puzzles. Although the Daleks were incapable of using their
   gunsticks
   and were left in a rare state of vulnerability that took its toll when the Daleks where picked off by Exxilons and the city's traps alike, they resorted to using ordinary guns to coerce the Doctor and company into following their orders. The Daleks ordered humans to place bombs around the city's central tower to destroy it. The city was destroyed, as was the Dalek space ship, when Galloway chose to atone for his ruthlessness as the acting commander by sacrificing his life to manually detonate bombs placed aboard the vessel. Though the Marine Space Corps could now retrieve their cure on future missions to Exxilon, the Doctor regretted having to destroy the Exxilon's city and lamented the loss of one of the universe's wonders.

When Borusa spoke to Rassilon and took his offer of immortality, he was turned to stone and became trapped within a sarcophagus. The Doctor was soon after returned to his time zone with Sarah Jane by Rassilon. (

   The Doctor returned to Peladon with the intent of reuniting with King Peladon, but accidentally jumped fifty years ahead of his last visit. By then, Peladon had died, with his daughter,
   Queen Thalira
   , ruling under a period of dissent, and an ongoing labour dispute between Pel nobility and the Pel miners worsened when apparitions of
   Aggedor
   attacked and killed several miners. Following an uprising by the oppressed miners, and distrust from the queen's chancellor,
   Ortron
   , regarding who the Doctor and Sarah had sided with, the two were sent to face the judgement of the
   Aggedor
   , whom the Doctor calmed with a Venusian lullaby. By Peladonian law, he and his companion were exonerated of any charges placed against them. With the situation worsening, Alpha Centauri summoned for assistance from the Federation, and they sent in
   Ice Warriors
   to ensure production. The Ice Warriors' commander,
   Azaxyr
   , threatened to kill hostages if the miners refused to work, and the Doctor brought the miners and ruling class together to fight the Ice Warriors.

   Following a long series of disputes, the Doctor, Sarah and the Peladonians learned the planet was under siege by
   Eckersley
   , a Federation defector seeking to manipulate the people into giving up their world's stores of trisilicate for his own gain. One of the miners,
   Ettis
   , attempted to wipe out the whole of them by firing a
   sonic lance
   on the Peladonian citadel, duelling the Doctor and subduing him long enough to use the device. Having planned against this, Azaxyr had placed a self-destruct mechanism on the lance, which killed Ettis when he activated it. After recovering from his duel, the Doctor found the apparitions of Aggedor were being created by a machine in the mine that Eckersley had protected with a security system, assaulting the Doctor's senses when he turned it on. When Eckersley cranked up its effects high enough to kill him, the Doctor used sensory withdrawal to block out the attack and feign death until Sarah could rescue him. With the cooperation of
   Gebek
   , leader of the miners, and Thalira's forces, Eckersley and the Ice Warriors were wiped out. Sadly, the Aggedor was a victim of the battle between the groups when he and Eckersley killed each other, upsetting the Doctor.

The Doctor held a strong disgust towards these people, who were any combination of stubborn, selfishly goal-driven or close-minded, and would be further outraged if they refused to listen to him, ignored his protests or went to absurd lengths just to dodge the risk of being proven wrong, especially when they acted antagonistic and undiplomatic.

    The Third Doctor's wardrobe was more colourful and ornate than any of those of his previous incarnations partially because, in real life, the BBC was experimenting with various combinations of colours during
    Jon Pertwee
    's tenure in the role to determine which ones would photograph best
    and partially because Pertwee had outfitted himself in a dark suit with a white frilled shirt and a black cravat, accompanied by an opera cape, for his screen test on the grounds that he found it the funniest clothing ensemble he had ever seen, much more worn--but rather than laughing him out of their offices, the casting advisors seized upon its flamboyance to give the Third Doctor his overall appearance.
