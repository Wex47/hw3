   According to one account, the purported two origins were actually distinct events within a single history. After Davros's Daleks were buried for a thousand years by the Doctor's efforts, the Kaleds evolved into the humanoid Daleks, with the Thousand Year War having come to an end. However, after the neutronic exchange that wiped out the "humanoid Dalek", or
   Dal
   , civilisation, the Dalek Prime created by Davros reemerged from underground, and, passing itself off as a new mutation, directed the new, "natural" mutant Daleks to climb into Dalek casings, seeing it as an easy way to expand its fledgling race. It then set itself up as the new race's leader. The Dal-descended Daleks remained subservient to the Dalek Prime and the other few Daleks made directly by Davros, as programming within the
   casings
   directed them to act so. (

Within 200 years, the Ameron humans had developed technology that frightened even the Halldons, including fearsome weapons. Realising the experiment had gone too far, the Halldons attempted to exterminate their test subjects, but the accelerated humans refused to bow down and destroyed their creators instead before continuing to evolve both in body and in technology at an accelerated rate, soon surpassing their Earthly brothers by millions of years. According to the scientist
   Bryant Anderson
   , who was later able to confirm via
   dissection

   Eventually, Susan realised the meaning of this message which had the Daleks so terrified: "peace and goodwill for all". She burst out laughing, startling and even terrifying many of the Daleks, who had never heard laughter in their lives. In the confusion, Susan took her chance to run off back to the TARDIS, and, despite the pleas of the lone Dalek she had befriended, she fled Skaro. The Daleks remained on a war footing for a while before finding the translation Susan had left behind and realising their error. (

Yvric tried to join forces with the "metal Daleks", offering to tell them a great secret (the location of the planet Earth, which he and Lodian had discovered before they were frozen), though he never got to reveal it, as the Daleks, not recognising one their own ancestors, mistook him for an invading android and obliterated him. Zet, having learned the secret of Earth from Lodian, tried the same thing and was met with more success, as the Golden Emperor had by then realised the truth. Before Zet could tell the metal Daleks how to get to Earth, however, Lodian caused an explosion which killed both himself and Zet, burying the secret. (

   a lone Dalek in
   2158
   Kansas
   had been damaged by weapon fire which penetrated its casing, allowing for a parasitic
   wasp
   to enter the body. Once the Dalek returned to base, it was deemed damaged and sent to the repair bay where its genetic material was to be analysed. This was part of the Daleks' standard practice of taking the
   DNA
   to the reproductive factories for the breeding of more Daleks. It was at this point that the
   Dalek Emperor
   from an alternate future arrived and informed them of a great catastrophe that would befall them and provided them a cure; an insecticide that would prevent a so-called "Mutant Phase" from occurring.

The Queen and unit 2150 attempted to turn the Strategist against the Emperor, but he used 2150 to improve a Dalek beam projector. Thus, instead of sending the Emperor to the Entity's dimension like 2150 thought he would, the Strategist sent the entire Mechanoid army there, bringing about a Dalek victory.

   from the coffin shop the Daleks had captured the Vampire from, apparated onboard the saucer, hoping to rescue the Great Vampire. The Tenth Doctor and Gelsin witnessed the creation of the Symbiont, which caused an unexpected power drain that allowed them to escape with the Eighth Doctor, while Brian chose to stay behind. Whilst escaping the Symbiont, Brian sabotaged the saucer's drive core so that, were he to be exterminated, he would take the saucer with him. Here he learned the target of the Daleks' Ultimate End and told the Doctors of it, then was rescued by the Tenth Doctor. Realising this meant that the Doctors would defend their homeworld, the Strategist ordered for Drones to be enhanced with Symbiont DNA to ensure their victory.

   The Doctors came to the

   flagship

   Birinji
   in order to exterminate the last of the Kotturuh,
   Inyit
   , was judged by her and given instant death, which spread to all Drones that were given Symbiont DNA. This threw the Daleks' assault into chaos, as they panicked that the judgement may spread to pure Dalek DNA, despite the Strategist's pleas to press the attack, giving the Eighth Doctor enough time to apparate aboard the saucer and fit a trigger to the drive core that was earlier sabotaged by Brian. Using a
   Kotturuh crystal
   to amplify the blast, the resulting explosion managed to send the saucer hurling into the Time Vortex, away from the Dark Times. (

   The Daleks assumed the Eighth Doctor dead, however, he had actually survived the blast using
   heat shields
   he acquired on Atharna. He continued to sabotage the saucer, trying to disguise his work as a series of malfunctions, causing conflict between the Commander and Strategist on how to resolve the situation. The Commander favoured the Executioner, giving it autonomy to purge the ship of aliens, whilst the Strategist worked with the Scientist to stabilise the saucer. The Doctor interrupted the Scientist's work by infiltrating his laboratory and tricked him into telling him about their prisoners and secretly planted an explosive on it. He helped the prisoners escaped the Executioner's increasingly insane rampage, with it destroying a Daleks and damaging the ship in the process. The Commander was unable to rein it in, to the Strategist's frustration. The Doctor detonated his explosive, exposing half the saucer to the Vortex causing it to start to break apart. The Strategist sought out the Doctor and tried to bargain with him for safe passage in his TARDIS. He played along however exposed the deal to the Commander, resulting in a firefight between the Strategist and Commander. The Strategist prevailed, killing the Commander, which prompted the Drones to turn on him as a traitor whilst the Doctor escaped. (

If the Doctor refused, it would destroy the Earth. With no way to destroy the Dalek, the Doctor agreed to the deal and provided it with
   an old Time Ring

There he'd get Kate to convince the humans to give it the materials it needed to rebuild its race. As the Dalek prepared to exterminate the Doctor, Rose reached out to Kate's human side, trying to get her to fight her Dalek side by reminding her of the
   good
   of humanity. After a mental struggle, Kate's human side regained control and she used her Dalek knowledge to set the Time Ring to self-destruct. The Dalek, trapped by Kate in a force field to protect the Doctor during her mental struggle, was caught in a warp implosion caused by the Time Ring self-destructing and was atomised. The Dalek Factor in Kate then deactivated without the Dalek there to stir it up and she lost everything the Dalek Factor had given her including her increased intelligence and Dalek personality. (

As Lumpy proceeded deeper into the Starbane, he and the other Daleks soon revealed that Lumpy had never been changed and that the Daleks had tricked the Doctor into literally giving them control of the Starbane. However, the Twelfth Doctor revealed that when he was repairing Lumpy he fitted in a device to control Lumpy's armour and managed to get Lumpy to the core while he piloted his TARDIS away - with the Daleks pursuing Lumpy unable to catch him. Forcing Lumpy to throw the orb into the core, the Starbane and the Dalek forces inside were destroyed - although Lumpy survived in a badly damaged state, screaming the Doctor's name as the Doctor bid farewell to his unlikely companion.

   The Daleks' gunstick evolved alongside other aspects of Dalek technology. When the First Doctor met them in the Dalek City, the gunstick seemed to have the same qualities as a human gun. Daleks could also change the effects of their guns' energy projectiles; at the lowest level, they would merely temporarily disable an individual in the area the projectiles struck. (

It also showed the killing of any opposed to their ideology; in this case, the Kaled scientists. Their shrieking voices were designed to parody the loud repetitive chanting and rants associated with Nazi rallies. The casting out or forced labour of the
   Mutos
   is comparable to the
   Holocaust
   , as is the Kaled consensus of them as lesser beings. Another comparison to the Holocaust appears in

    They have been compared over the years with Nazis, but this is a tenuous connection at best. Certainly there is a lack of individuality, an unquestioning obedience of orders and a willingness to die for the race - all of this epitomised the Nazi stormtrooper ideal. It isn't hard to see, though, even in the most evil member of the Nazi hierarchy, some spark of buried humanity. Even the elite had their fears and superstitions. The Daleks had none of these.

    Real life analogies quickly fail when applied to the Daleks. At times they're compared to the likes of Nazis, but in truth they're literally lacking in humanity. Even "conquest" as we generally understand the term doesn't really interest them - sometimes they put foes to work as slaves (as in

The point is that one can (and should) hope to use reason against real-world governments, but there is virtually no chance of diplomacy succeeding against the Daleks. ... Basically, the Daleks collectively remain united behind one goal: kill everything that isn't a Dalek.
