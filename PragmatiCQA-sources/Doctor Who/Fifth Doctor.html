    the Doctor
   </a>
   , who did not make himself an imposition, preferring to be
   honest
   reserved, and
   honourable
   . However, the Doctor was also less willing to do what he thought was immoral, and became highly conflicted about what choices he could make in a crisis that were truly right. His hesitancy made him seemingly more fallible than many other incarnations, making those around him wonder if he was capable of resolving difficult situations. Nevertheless, he was one of the most overtly fearless incarnations, and frequently found himself right in the thick of battle.

   Turlough
   's antagonism. Stuck in the middle with him was usually
   Nyssa
   , who regularly had to stand as a voice of reason. Even after he seemingly was settled on just having one companion, he and
   Peri Brown
   found another companion, a
   pharaoh
   from
   Egypt
   called
   Erimem

   1851

   Victoria
   had just attended a séance performed by
   James Lees

With the natives' impression of Earth coloured by the treatment "Lees" had received when he started having visions, the Doctor sealed the rift after rescuing the real Lees, the soldiers who had accompanied the Doctor sacrificing themselves to keep the natives back until the rift was closed.

   Arriving in 1896 London, the Doctor and Tegan discovered that Nyssa had been abducted by a group dedicated to
   Nephthys
   , intending to use Nyssa as a new "prison" for Nephthys that could be easier for her to escape. Working with
   Atkins
   , the butler of the man who had discovered Nyssa in the tomb of Nephthys, the Doctor and Tegan were able to determine that Nephthys's essence had been divided between instinct and consciousness, with her instinct restored in a clone of her previous host while her conscious mind was trapped in Nyssa. With the aid of Lady
   Ann Talbot
   , the Doctor tricked Nephthys into making a series of round trips between 1922 and 1992 via an Osiran time corridor, eventually causing her to age to death while Nyssa was safely restored and Nephthys' consciousness was trapped in a new prison. (

   Taking the TARDIS to Manussa after reading about its history, the Mara landed the ship before the rise of the
   Sumaran Empire
   , and embarked on a scheme to bring about the subjugation of Manussa in that time period instead, keeping the Doctor as its primary host while possessing several
   Manussans
   . However, Tegan and Turlough were able to free the Doctor using a circle of television cameras and screens, and the Doctor linked the crystal the Mara was using as a link to the material world to the TARDIS so he could reverse the creature's physical manifestation. However, the process required that the crystal be in physical contact with the Mara, and the giant snake, fuelled by the despair of the many Manussans it had managed to possess, had swallowed the TARDIS whole. In the end, a young man who had been brought into existence by the crystal technology sacrificed himself by going out into the snake's belly with the crystal, destroying it by "restoring the balance".

   As they left York, the TARDIS received a signal from Kamelion's own home planet, drawing him back along with others of his kind. After they followed the signal to a deserted world, the Doctor learned that Kamelion's original designers had been the centre of a vast empire, after the native Kamile uploaded their minds to the Locus when their planet suffered an environmental catastrophe that made it impossible to sustain life, using the Kamelion as a means of remotely enforcing their will on other worlds (the Doctor noted that this didn't match The Master's original description of Kamelion's history, but Kamelion observed that The Master was a notorious liar). Eventually, the Kamile within the Locus came together as four distinct factions that were essentially amalgamations of the original individual personas uploaded into it, titling themselves Authority, Liberty, Harmony and Chaos, with these factions eventually coming into conflict in a day-long war that involved their entire empire and its artificial intelligences, leaving Chaos trapped on that world. Chaos tried to use Kamelion to take control of the TARDIS, but Kamelion retained just enough control of himself to stop his body being used to harm his friends, allowing the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough to thwart Chaos's attempt to change history and then trap him in a secondary console room in the TARDIS before transferring Chaos back into the Locus. Despite Chaos's final defeat, Kamelion initially requested that he be abandoned on that planet so that he couldn't hurt anyone else, only accepting a compromise where he would remain in an isolated room in the TARDIS, trying to protect himself from being used by others against his friends.

With
   Leela
   as his unofficial bodyguard and Tegan appointed as Earth's ambassador to justify her continued presence on Gallifrey, the Doctor used the opportunity to make some changes to Gallifrey's political process that he felt were necessary, such as opening new Academies capable of conferring the rank of Time Lord to their students.

He eventually chose to reject her offer, with Leela helping the Doctor recognise that taking such a stance would turn himself and his people into tyrants enforcing their will on other civilisations. They were rescued from the malfunctioning giant TARDIS by Tegan and the Doctor took the opportunity to relinquish the presidency, passing it on to Lowri, and depart Gallifrey once more. (

Understanding but disobeying the warning, the Doctor and Amy met another tracer inside the pyramid, and she already had one of the segments of the Key in her possession, along her assistant in her quest,
   Harmonious 14 Zink
   . The Tracer agreed to the Doctor's suggestion of "
   Zara
   " as a name. At the top of the pyramid, Zara touched the segment and turned it back into a crystal. This caused a
   gravity well
   to appear, causing massive changes to Mars' environment. Zara left with the segment using
   Zink's Time Ring
   . The Doctor, Amy and Zink jumped on board an approaching ship, and the Doctor piloted it to safety. Unable to help the catastrophe inflicted on Mars, the Doctor and Amy left in the TARDIS for their next destination. They arrived inside a
   castle
   on the
   ring world
   of
   Safeplace
   , where there was a succession dispute between the
   Valdigians
   Lady
   Mesca Amuntic
   and
   Wembik
   . The Doctor concocted an anti-venom for Mesca, whom Wembik had
   poisoned
   because she refused to allow Mesca's son to become
   king
   .

   Meanwhile, the
   Ice Warriors
   , led by Isskar, were guided to Safeplace by Zara to find the next segment, and began fighting the Valdigians. When the Ice Warriors were repelled, Amy worked out a compromise between Mesca and Wembik; they agreed to be married to one another, so that no matter whose son became king, he would also be the son of the other one. While the Doctor asked Isskar to speak to him, his men brought Amy outside the castle grounds. Zara realised the castle was the next segment and turned it into a crystal, trapping the Doctor, the TARDIS, the Valdigians and Isskar inside. The Doctor struggled to hold on, before Amy, having received the segment in her battle with Zara, turned the segment back into a castle, allowing the Doctor, the Ice Warriors and the Valdigians to escape. Amy then turned it back into a crystal and placed it into her satchel.

   Isskar's ship
   to take them as tribunal; Isskar confiscated the segments and sent the TARDIS overboard while the ship was in
   hyperspace
   in the event of the Doctor and Amy's escape. Zara, being unable to detect Amy's segments, travelled back in time with the time ring, having "wrecked the controls" of the ship. The ship was on a collision course with the
   red giant

   Leboon

   The Black Guardian showed the Doctor and Amy a set of potential locations for the Key. Noticing that the Black Guardian was being methodical in his approach, the Doctor told him to randomly send the Doctor and Amy to a location. Landing in

   in the
   9th century
   , the Doctor encountered the
   White Guardian
   whose powers had waned and was posing as Legate of the Caliph going after tax evaders. He then discovered that the Black Guardian was a tax evader, who was hoarding gold to allow his compatriot the

   Chaos
   , he realised that Zara had kidnapped Amy as Zara thought that he would lead her to the last segment. Having contacted
   Romana II
   in the confusion, thinking that Astra was her, the Doctor discovered that after the Key was scattered the last time, Romana had become the final segment of it. To save Romana's life, Astra offered to become the final segment instead, even if it involved her dying to do so. When the White and Black Guardians arrived to try to take the Key away from the Doctor, the Doctor threw it into the

   An explosion set off by the criminal
   Arktos
   and his accomplice,
   Elkin
   , had ripped apart the floor of the nearby mines, killing the
   miners
   inside. Within the wreckage, Erimem discovered a message in
   Egyptian
   hieroglyphs warning of the
   Osiran
   Sekhmet
   , whom the
   Egyptians
   worshipped as a god. The Doctor found a secret passageway leading to Sekhmet's
   trisilicate
   tomb, where three of her four
   blood locks
   had been broken after she fed on the
   blood
   of three royal women, including Alixlyr and the newly crowned
   King
   Pelleas
   ' predecessor, Queen
   Elspera
   , and used the Aggedor to break down the door. Erimem offered her blood to Sekhmet, but had poisoned it with
   mandrake
   root that was inside her ring. Zixlyr grabbed onto Sekhmet and set the countdown on his volataliser. Zixlyr sealed the chamber, blowing himself up along with Sekhmet. The Doctor and Erimem escaped, but Erimem was still dying from her poison. Peri used the Time Lord biochemistry in the Doctor's blood to revive Erimem by performing a "very crude"
   blood transfusion
   on her.

   In a negated timeline, the Doctor and Nyssa followed mysterious coordinates to
   23 November
   1963
   , but the Doctor landed the TARDIS earlier than the coordinates indicated to avoid a trap. Investigating their surroundings, the Doctor and Nyssa were approached by
   Bob Dovie
   , who mistook them for the police officers he had contacted about his missing family, and discovered that Dovie's wife and children had been murdered by
   the Decayed Master
   . As they made their way back to the TARDIS, Dovie followed them, and his refusal to believe in the TARDIS set off the
   conceptual bomb
   the Master had planted on him, causing the TARDIS to explode, but the Doctor was saved by his
   sixth incarnation
   . Joining with his other selves to formulate a plan to stop the Master, the Fifth Doctor realised the solution was to visit Dovie a year earlier and introduce him to the TARDIS, so that he would find it more believable when he had the conceptual bomb and it would not go off. Once his plan succeeded, the Fifth Doctor joined his other seven incarnations in preparing to
   time ram
   the Master's TARDIS
   . However, rather than kill the Master, the

   Davison, a busy actor with other commitments, had his hair cut short at the beginning of

   , because other projects like
   <i key="8da535bc-eacb-4b9a-bf25-a6dbfa0a71ad">
    All Creatures Great and Small
   </i>
   required it. For reasons unclear, he was then allowed to grow his hair several inches while filming as the Fifth Doctor. However, since the episodes aired out of order, his hair length quite obviously varied.

   Were it not for the fact that most serials of season 19 narratively dovetailed into each other, it might be possible to simply believe that the character simply liked to go to the barber shop between stories. Unfortunately for this theory,
   <i key="90c673d5-85f0-46c3-90fa-a1aa9b4df754">
    Four to Doomsday
   </i>
   was narratively tied to the beginning of

   , so the jarring hair growth can only be regarded as a production error.

  <p key="515486b1-553e-495a-9201-9e399c81c88e">
   Davison cut his hair prior to each season, and the production team allowed him to grow it throughout each of his
   production blocks
   . However,
   <i key="7909addd-811c-41cc-8172-450c3a1dcb35">
    Snakedance

   was the final story of his tenure broadcast out of production order, and
   <i key="cafd4686-f485-4bf2-8492-1f1b679335b6">
    Arc of Infinity
   </i>
   didn't obviously lead into it. Thus, although Davison was again allowed to grow his hair throughout the production of
   seasons 20
   and
   21
   , it never amounted to the kind of production error it was throughout season 19.

   fans can tell the production order of episodes by the length of the Fifth Doctor's hair.

   In several DVD commentaries, Peter Davison claims he abandoned his
   half-moon glasses
   because
   Janet Fielding
   teased him when he used them. Fielding seemed to agree with this assessment on the commentary for

   Davison agreed to wear a stick of
   celery
   on his lapel on the understanding that
   JNT
   would eventually have a writer explain the bizarre fashion statement. Though Davison thought the explanation would come earlier, the mystery was at last revealed in his final story. (
