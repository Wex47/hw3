   (AMNH), Brown traversed the country bargaining and trading for fossils.  His field was not limited to dinosaurs.  He was known to collect or obtain anything of possible scientific value.  Often, he simply sent money to have fossils shipped to the AMNH, and any new specimen of interest often resulted in a flurry of letters between the discoverer and Brown.

   The Hell Creek digs produced extravagant quantities of fossils, enough to fill up whole train cars.  As was common practice back then Brown's crews used controlled blasts of dynamite to remove the tons of rock covering their fossil discoveries.  Everything was moved with horse-drawn carriages and pure man-power.  Seldom was any site data recorded.
