   named Junior is chased by a
   Tsintaosaurus
   . His father, Speckles, shows up to rescue him. Speckles scolds at Junior as he could have been killed and for not fighting back (and also due to the fact that Junior is all Speckles has left). The next day, when Speckles is hunting some Protoceratops, Junior is in the way and ends up in the water. He can't swim (As Junior has become aquaphobic from being washed out to sea in the first film) , so he calls for help, despite being in shallow water. Speckles is disappointed in his son's cowardice. However, Speckle's over-reacts and scolds Junior for his inability to conquer his fear. Hurt by his father's comments, Junior tells his father that he hates him and the pair storm off from one another.

   Meanwhile, Speckles is still looking for Jr. He meets a
   Saichania
   named Cy, who wants to avenge the loss of his best friend Daisy at the claws of the same Deinonychus. Jr., meanwhile befriends Blue and meets a
   Monoclonius
   , called Dusty, while looking for shelter. While passing through a deep, dark ravine, Speckles and Cy are attacked by five giant
   Brontoscorpio
   . Speckles is able to kill or injure all of them, but one manages to sting him on the leg, poisoning him.

   Meanwhile, at the dome, Jr., Blue and Dusty are attracted by food. Dusty tries to eat some plants, but a
   Dsungaripterus
   steals them. Cy and a dying Speckles are on their way, when Speckles begins to hallucinate on seeing Junior, but it really isn't. That's when a sand dune starts to shake and they end up in a dark pit. There, they meet a female Tarbosaurus named Fang who heals Speckle's wound with herbs. Fang is revealed to be Blue's mother and is searching for her. She joins Speckles and Cy. While Jr., Blue, and Dusty are playing, Ditto, one of the members of the pack, catches them and takes Dusty all the way up the dome. In return for food, the Dsungaripterus reveals that the Deinoychus are giving the young dinosaurs as sacrifices to a mysterious beast that lives in the local volcano. The beast in turn gives the young dinosaurs to his offspring as "toys" to play with, and when they get bored, they kill and eat them.

   Speckles, Fang and Cy meet a
   Ruyangosaurus
   herd and they stop a pack of Carnotaurus from stealing Ruyangosarus eggs. Speckle's while initially reluctant to aid the Ruyangosaurus he then gives in. Back at the compund, Junior tells Blade to try and escape this area, so later that night, Junior distracts the Deinonychus, while Blade and Blue throw stones at them. But Blue misses one, so the Deinonychus follow them, capturing them yet again.

   The Deinonychus capture the Dsungaripterus, who are threatening to kill him, then, they chase Cy and have him cornered on a cliff. Speckles and Fang arrive and ambush them. One Deinonychus is left behind and knocked off by Cy. The pathway is blocked by boulders, but the same herd of Ruyangosaurus that the gang aided earlier helped clear the rocks.

   The volcano begins to erupt and the Dsungaripterus told them it's erupting. Meanwhile, Speckles, Fang and Cy fight the Deinonychus pack. Blade told the other dinosaurs to stampede out of the dome, because the volcano is erupting. Speckles, Fang and Cy search for Junior. Blade fights Slash and a pair of Deinonychus over a pit of lava, then sends Slash and the Deinonychus falling to their doom in the lava pit.

   Speckles and Fang finally find Jr, Blue and Blade, who are running towards a river. Although Junior can't swim, he jumps in along with Blue and Blade. When they dove down, they find the cave the Dsungaripterus was talking about. There, they find Dusty being chased by three large iguanas. Luckily, Speckles and Fang are able to save them. Once again, Speckles shows his strict attitude about Junior not being brave enough to take on the beasts without retreating. Speckles soon realizes the error of his ways after being scolded by Blue for taking Junior for granted. However, they are soon confronted by the beast, which turns out to be a giant iguana many times larger than a Tarbosaurus. Junior sacrifices himself by letting the iguana hit him, which knocked him out. Everyone mourns for an unconscious Junior who wakes up, making everyone relieved. Speckles apologizes to his son for being so hard on him and that he is happy that Junior is his son. The volcano starts to erupt, and the gang is able to escape.
