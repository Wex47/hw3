   Insects are a class of hexapod invertebrates and the largest group within the arthropod phylum. The first insects appeared during the Devonian (possibly even earlier, during the ordovician), along with the first terrestrial plants, and from there, diversified into a myriad of groups and forms. Insects evolved from crustaceans, and the first insects were wingless, perhaps resembling a silverfish or a firebrat. The first insects were landbound, and the first animals to gain the power of flight.
