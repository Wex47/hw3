   Four years later, Speckles has scraped by on his own, scavenging and raiding nests. One day while attempting to steal food from One-Eye, Speckles encounters a female

   Over the years, Speckles and Blue-Eyes attempt to maintain a hunting territory away from One-Eye. Eventually, however, One-Eye discovers their hunting grounds and again attempts to usurp their territory. Speckles fights and eventually defeats and drives away his old nemesis.

   After defeating One-Eye, Speckles and Blue-Eyes reclaim Speckles' old family nest and hunting grounds. Now a mature adult pair with three young offspring, the family is happy until forced to flee from their territory by a volcanic eruption. Speckles becomes the alpha of a large migratory herd of dinosaurs fleeing the natural disaster. During the disaster, one of the children is killed and Blue-Eyes is wounded; she eventually collapses from exhaustion two weeks later. Seeing this, a large pack of

   After a long journey, the herd arrives at a new, fertile area in which to settle. However, Speckles once again encounters One-Eye, who has been driven out by the same natural disaster. As before, One-Eye causes the herbivores to stampede in order to ambush Speckles and his two babies. Another child is killed and the remaining child, Speckles Jr., is pushed over a cliff into the ocean. Speckles dives into the sea to save him and is pursued by One-Eye. One Eye is attacked and eaten alive by two gigantic

   In the closing monologue, Speckles wishes a peaceful, happy life for his son.
