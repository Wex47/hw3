   s ago when the glaciers began to retreat. This retreat marked the end of the glacial phase of the most recent ice age. Its character was set by the spread of forests as the ice retreated and then by their shrinkage as mankind's demand for timber and agricultural land grew. Although we think of the Holocene as a warm time for the planet, we are still in an ice age. This is indicated by the presence of ice caps at the poles - the planet as a whole is just in an interglacial phase.

   Sea levels rose in the Holocene as the Pleistocene ice retreated. Global warming caused by pollution continues this trend today. By the the start of the Holocene, the land bridge that linked Asia with North America was under water and New Guinea was separated from Australia. Africa and Australia continue to move northward. As
   humanity
   spread around the world, more and more species were wiped out. This trend continues today. It is now referred to as the Sixth Extinction (otherwise known as the Holocene Extinction).
