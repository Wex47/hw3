   velociraptorines are probably
   from the
   , and possibly
   from North America. However, several indeterminate velociraptorines have also been discovered, dating to the
   stage, in the
   Period. These fossils were discovered in the Langenberg quarry, Oker near
   ,
   .

   In 2007
   studied front limb bones of
   and discovered small bumps on the surface, known as quill knobs. The same feature is present in some bird bones, and represents the attachment point for strong secondary wing feathers. This finding provided the first direct evidence that velociraptorines, like all other maniraptorans, had feathers.

   While most velociraptorines were generally small animals, at least one species may have achieved gigantic sizes comparable to those found among the
   . So far, this unnamed giant velociraptorine is known only from isolated teeth found on the
   ,
   . The teeth belong to an animal the size of dromaeosaurines of the genus
   , but they appear to belong to a velociraptorine, judging by the shape of the teeth and the anatomy of their serrations.
