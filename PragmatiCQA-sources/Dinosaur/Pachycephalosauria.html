    Pachycephalosauria
   </b>
   is a group of marginocephalians that is recognizable by the squamosal and very horned face that almost all pachycephalosaurians possess that are in abundance on the snout and back of the head. the most interesting part of this group is the placement of the head on the neck which is from the base of the skull creating a 'J' shaped neck, most likely for absorbing force in combat against other individuals.
