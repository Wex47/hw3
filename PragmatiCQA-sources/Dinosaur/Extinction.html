    extinction
   </b>
   is when a living organism is completely wiped out.  Extinctions have occurred due to climate change, natural disasters, new species introduction, etc.  Major extinctions on Earth were the Oxygen Catastrophe, the Ordovician-Silurian extinction, the late Devonian extinction, the Permian-Triassic extinction, the Triassic-Jurassic extinction, and the Cretaceous-Paleocene extinction.  The Oxygen Catastrophe happened when dioxygen entered the air in large amounts and killed off many of the obligate anaerobic monerans.  The Ordovician-Silurian occurred when a massive ice age killed off about two thirds of all brachiopods, bivalves,
   echinoderms
   , bryozoans, and corals.  The late Devonian extinction was caused by oceanic cooling and only affected the sea organisms.  The
   Permian-Triassic
   extinction occurred when carbon dioxide that was trapped underground was released and caused massive global heating, wiping out over 90% of all life.  The Triassic-Jurassic extinction occurred as a result of gradual climate change which wiped out all
   conodonts
   , 34% of sea life, all crurotarsans or non-dinosaurian archosaurs, the remaining
   Therapsids
   , and many of the large amphibians.  Probably the most famous extinction event is the Cretaceous-Paleogene.  This extinction event was caused a large meteorite that crashed into the Earth, wiping out lots of ammonites, almost all reptiles, all the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and sea diapsids. No animals on land that were bigger than a dog survived. This extinction event paved the way for the
