   Cryptovolans('' hidden aviator'') was a genus of bird dinosaur in the family Dromaeosauridae.Je known for its perfect fliers(feathers intended for flying). At least he was partially capable of active flight. So he was one of the first flying dinosaurs, which was not one of the true birds.It lived at the same time (lower cretaceous) and in the same place as Microraptor.There are opinions that it is the same genus.

   This theopod was about 90 centimeters long and and weighing approximately 187 g. On the thumb of its lower extremities, like its relative Velociraptor, it had a sickle claw intended to hunt small prey in the form of lizards and small mammals. Maybe it was hunting in a flock.
