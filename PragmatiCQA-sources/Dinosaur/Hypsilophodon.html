   . He had gained access in 1868 to a specimen found in January that year by the Reverend
    William Fox
    ,
    who had earlier discovered some fossils of the animal also.
    This specimen included the skull, which had been lacking with the Mantell-Bowerbank block. Huxley first announced the new species in 1869 in a lecture; the text of this, publicised the same year, forms the official naming article, because it also contained a sufficient description.
    In 1870 Huxley expanded this into a full article, in which he as the first researcher noticed that the

   specimens were discovered between 1849 and 1921 and are in the possession of the Natural History Museum that acquired the collections of Mantell, Fox, Hulke and Hooley.
    These represent about twenty individual animals. Apart from the holotype and paratype, the most significant specimens are: NHM R5829, the skeleton of a large animal; NHM R5830 and NHM R196/196a, both skeletons of juvenile animals; and NHM R2477, a block with a skull together with two separate vertebral columns.

   was bipedal: it ran on two legs. Its entire body was built for running. A light-weight, minimized skeleton, low,

    consisted of nine cervical vertebrae, fifteen or sixteen dorsal vertebrae, six of five sacral vertebrae and about forty-eight vertebrae of the tail. Much of the back and the tail was stiffened by long ossified tendons connecting the spines on top of the vertebrae. The processes on the underside of the tail vertebrae, the chevrons, were also connected by ossified tendons, which however were of a different form: they were shorter and split and frayed at one end, with the point of the sharp other end laying within the diverging end of the subsequent tendon. Furthermore, there were several counterdirectional rows of these, resulting in a herring-bone pattern completely immobilising the tail end.

    As Galton pointed out in 2008, the putative armour instead appears to be from the torso, an example of internal intercostal plates associated with the rib cage. It consists of thin mineralized circular plates growing from the back end of the middle rib shaft and overlapping the front edge of the subsequent rib. Such plates are better known from

    In 1882
    Louis Dollo
    named a separate

    By the middle of the twentieth century that had become the accepted classification but in the early twenty-first century it became clear through
    cladistic
    analysis that hypsilophodontids formed an unnatural,
    paraphyletic
    group of successive off-shoots from the stem of the

    Jurassic
    to the end of the Cretaceous shared the common design of a small running herbivore that apparently was very successful.

    Hypsilophodon
   </i>
   fed on low-growing vegetation, in view of the pointed snout most likely preferring high quality plant material, such as young shoots and roots, in the manner of modern
    deer
    . The structure of its skull, with the teeth set far back into the jaw, strongly suggests that it had cheeks, an advanced feature that would have facilitated the chewing of food. There were twenty-three to twenty-seven maxillary and dentary teeth with vertical ridges in the animal's upper and lower jaws which, due to the fact that the tooth row of the lower jaw, its teeth curving outwards, fitted within that of the upper jaw, with its teeth curving inwards, appear to have been self-sharpening, the
    occlusion
    wearing down the teeth and providing for a simple chewing mechanism. As in almost all dinosaurs and certainly all the
    ornithischians
    , the teeth were continuously replaced in an alternate arrangement, with the two replacement waves moving from the back to the front of the jaw. The Z(ahnreihen)-spacing, the average distance in tooth position between teeth of the same eruption stage, was rather low with

   Early paleontologists modelled the body of this small, bipedal, herbivorous dinosaur in various ways. In 1882 Hulke suggested that
   <i key="f8296f14-feac-4bc0-a43f-6873aaa19fc1">
    Hypsilophodon
   </i>
   was quadrupedal but also, in view of its grasping hand, able to climb rocks and trees in order to seek shelter.
    In 1912 this line of thought was further pursued by Austrian paleontologist
    Othenio Abel
    . Concluding that the first toe of the foot could function as an opposable
    hallux
    , Abel stated that
   <i key="f4d60a2b-dd2c-44c4-9092-2c62f07da715">
    Hypsilophodon
   </i>
   was a fully arboreal animal and even that an arboreal lifestyle was primitive for the dinosaurs as a whole.
    Though this hypothesis was doubted by Nopcsa,
    it was adopted by the Danish researcher
    Gerhard Heilmann
    who in 1916 proposed that a quadrupedal
   <i key="ce7fc98e-474d-40c5-92c6-c7095305a6c1">
    Hypsilophodon
   </i>
   lived like the modern
    tree-kangaroo
   <i key="a9675f48-777b-4af5-a1c6-c6891268d0dc">
    Dendrolagus
   </i>
   .
    In 1926 Heilmann had again changed his mind, denying that the first toe was opposable because the first metatarsal was firmly connected to the second,
    but in 1927 Abel refused to accept this.
    In this he was in 1936 supported by Swinton who claimed that even a forward pointing first metatarsal might carry a movable toe.
    As Swinton was a very influential populariser of dinosaurs, this remained the accepted view for over three decades, most books typically illustrating
   <i key="bc36ccb8-56f2-47e2-a19d-df763ccf79e2">
    Hypsilophodon
   </i>
   sitting on a tree branch. However, Peter M. Galton in 1969 performed a more accurate analysis of the musculo-skeletal structure, showing that the body posture was horizontal.
    In 1971 Galton in detail refuted Abel's arguments, showing that the first toe had been incorrectly reconstructed and that neither the curvature of the claws, nor the level of mobility of the shoulder girdle or the tail could be seen as adaptations for climbing,
    concluding that
   <i key="ae5f7041-6bf3-450b-9077-3c04f043efc5">
    Hypsilophodon
   </i>
   was a bipedal running form.
    This convinced the paleontological community that

    Wikipedia:sexual dimorphism
    : Galton considered it likely that exemplars with five instead of six sacral vertebrae — with some specimens the vertebra that should normally count as the first of the sacrum has a rib not touching the pelvis — represented female individuals.
