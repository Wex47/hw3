   Period. It is believed to have been carnivorous, was bipedal and about 2.4 meters in length. It is known primarily from a single fossilized tibia, which, unusually, had been fossilized through a rare process in which the bone turned to opal. The opalized tibia was purchased by a gem shop in 1973 along with a foot claw that might have come from the same animal. Remains have been found in Andamooka, South Australia. This small dinosaur seems to have had long, slender legs, and its ankle was higher and narrower than that of most other theropods. Kakuru was formally named in 1980. The type species is Kakuru kujani.
