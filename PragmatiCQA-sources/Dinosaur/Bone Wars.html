   Cope found out and then humiliated Marsh through mass media. Then one day, at the same site, marsh humiliated cope by saying that he had placed the head of an Elasmosaurus on it's tail. Marsh had lied so he could get his revenge on cope. Finally, they agreed on the challenge which cope won.

   The 'Bone wars' led to the finding of tons of famous fossils. Marsh who was now furious asked scientists to disect his brain to prove that he was smarter than Marsh. This did not happen and Marsh's and Cope's relationship detoriated.
