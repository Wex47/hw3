    Albian
   </b>
   is one of the middle Cretaceous epochs. It was dominated by Ceratopsians, the last Brachiosaurids, Ornithopods, and some theropods.  Examples of the Albian dinosaurs are Sauroposeidon, maybe some Protoceratops, Iguanodon, and Saltasaurus. Plesiosaurs and Icthyosaurs are still alive, yet the long tailed Pterosaurs died out, Pterodactyls (short tailed pterosaurs) replaced them. Continents were getting ready for shaping up to their modern looks. All Allosaurids had died out.and new Carnosaurs appeared. Nodosaurids (hornless and clubless Ankylosaurs) were evolving.
