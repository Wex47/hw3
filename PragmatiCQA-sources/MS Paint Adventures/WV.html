   is a mysterious wanderer who exists "years in the future, but not many" - in
   2422
   , in fact. Prior to becoming an exile, he was a

   known as the Warweary Villein. He becomes a playable character during

   . Like all other

   and simply picks up objects when told so without further complication. Though this severely limits his inventory capacity - to the number of things he could reasonably carry - it also means he isn't prone to Fetch Modus-related shenanigans.

   "Villein"
   means a "free person under the feudal system" as well as a farmer. To differentiate commands between his past and future selves, his past self's commands end with a question mark (?). All exiles each have multiple titles composed of two words. The first and second words of each title start with the same letter.

   The Vagabond has a deep, intense hatred for Kings, whom he sees as bossy tyrants, stemming from his past as the Warweary Villein. Instead of royalty, he likes the concept of democratically elected mayors, to the point of building '

   When the Vagabond presses tab on his keyboard, a picture of a planet representing Prospit falls on the floor and the TaB cans come out. This mirrors Prospit's moon falling onto The Battlefield and Dream John and Dream Jade entering. The TaB can explosion after the chess game he plays could be seen as Dream Jade's death. The Vagabond seems to "mourn the loss of the citizen tab", while the

   The Vagabond seems to "decide" how the planets look like and if they have any moons. He recreates the world he knows, either from his memories or due to some subconscious knowledge he has as a game construct.

   WV initially met and befriended PM when they crossed paths during their time in exile, and they appeared to become close friends. During their time spent with the Aimless Renegade, it became apparent that he harbored some level of romantic feelings for her, as he tried to win her over with gifts. After WV was unceremoniously gutted by Bec Noir, PM donned the Queen's ring and teleported him to the

   WV is seen to trust John, despite his original rudeness. This may be due to their many encounters, the first of which was their meeting on the battlefield when he was WV?, in which John gave him the wallet and the ring to keep safe. The many commands that WV gave John, while delivered in a seemingly rude manner, shows that WV at the very least trusts John enough to carry out actions that decide the fate of entire planets. While they have not interacted much since then, it can be assumed that the trust remains. (Though, if Dave and WV are best bros, what about John?)
