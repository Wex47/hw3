   is, as the name would suggest, a device that can be used to temporarily store objects and persons outside of the current time stream and thus "send" them to the future. The top of the capsule resembles a pink lotus flower. The bottom appears to be made of stone, but it also features a time countdown and greatly resembles the
   Cruxtruder
   . Said countdown indicates how long it will take the capsule to bloom and release its contents back into the normal time stream. Usually the capsule seems to be located in the

   Later, we are shown the Frog Temple within the Medium, and we see the Lotus Time Capsule again. Unlike when we see it in Jade's time, the capsule is entirely green, and currently has no blooming flower. Instead it holds a glowing white orb referred to as "a seed". Later, we see the
