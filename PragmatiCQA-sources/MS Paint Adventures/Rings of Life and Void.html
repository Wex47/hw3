  <p key="16d48c0e-97b8-4f04-9319-e18612991e50">
   It is currently unknown if a revived ghost can remain alive if the ring is removed, as Aranea was killed immediately after its removal, and proceeded to dematerialize. It is also unknown how immortal a ghost that wasn't a god tier would be if wearing it, and if they would react differently to its removal. It is unknown if the ring works on a living or uninjured player. However, an interesting property of the ring seems to be that players can carry it to or from the dream bubbles by sleeping and waking.

  <p key="e9f1deb0-61c3-4aad-bd49-43412416e36d">
   Another interesting property is that the ring doesn't bring the dead body to life, but instead actually makes the ghost wearing it corporeal. For example, when Roxy gives the ring to
   Calliope
   , she is not resurrected in Caliborn's body but becomes a completely new being.

   and
   (an ability that is
   to be a power of the ring itself). Although Roxy is later
   to use these same powers without the aid of the ring, this is likely because the ring helped her get in touch with her powers as a hero of Void. The ring also has the standard powers of a queen's ring, so a

    Similar to how the Queen's Rings heavily reference the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the Rings of Life and Void themselves seem to be a reference to a quote spoken by Sauron to Frodo while he wears the One Ring: "There is no life in the void, only death."

    The Rings can be thought to mirror Roxy and
    Jane
    ; the Ring of Void originates from Derse where Roxy, a hero of Void, dreams. Meanwhile, the session's female dreamer on Derse's counterpart, Prospit, is Jane, a hero of Life.

   <li key="145bcb2e-0310-4f48-bd51-3b7cb0c2fe9c">
    The Rings could possibly be a reference to The One Ring from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, specifically the Ring of Void, giving the user to turn invisible, but with the added bonus of passing through objects.
