   , and it is the basis of a stratified societal caste system that assigns social status based on blood; low-ranking trolls are regarded as "Lowbloods", whereas high-ranking trolls are referred to as "Highbloods". Different blood castes also have differing biological aspects, such as the high psychic ability among Lowbloods, and the gills possessed by the high-blooded ruling Seadwellers. Natural lifespan also increases in line with one's rung on the Hemospectrum; rustbloods may only live for a few decades, whereas the high-blooded

   The eggs hatch into young larval trolls, known as wigglers, which wriggle about to locate a cozy stalactite from which to spin their cocoons. Curiously a wiggler's eye color is sometimes depicted as the same as their blood color (although Sollux's wiggler eyes seem to be blue and red), while in the credits they are shown to have yellow eyes with gray irises like teenage trolls. If their eyes do have their blood color, it can be assumed that the change to yellow is part of their drastic metamorphosis during pupation. These grey eyes

Together, they surface and choose a location to build a hive, the Alternian equivalent of a house. The building process is facilitated by carpenter droids left on the planet to cater to the young for building.

   while humans reproduce heterosexually, making it clear that she was referring to biological sex instead of gender and stating almost conclusively that trolls have two distinct biological sexes.

   have a concept of hermaphroditism, but it applies to livestock and not trolls themselves. If trolls did not have a term or concept of homo- and heterosexuality due to not having a sexual preference being the norm in their society, then they would not have created one for hermaphrodite if they also fell into this category. Further evidence for this can be found in how Kanaya finds it strange that humans can lactate yet are not hermaphrodites like the species found within the butler genus, and we know that female trolls do not produce milk because
   . Ultimately, the matter remains inconclusive, and Hussie shows no signs of
   the reproductive biology of trolls any further, although he has offered up
   as a potential explanation for the different troll genders. The drones are shown to hold two separate buckets with a differing symbol on each arm, one specifically for kismesissitude, and one for matespritship, it can be determined that genetic materials are different depending on the pairing. In other words, a matespritships and kismesissitudes could possibly result in the release of different gametes, resulting in this labelling on the drones.

   Hussnasty Mode
   ). However, it can be assumed that they do have ears of some sort as they are humanoid and can hear. It is also very likely their ears are pointed, as shown in Hivswap Act 2 during the trial scene, which you can see from the various troll's talk sprites.. Sea dwellers have fins on the sides of their heads (though whether they are in essence webbed ears or separate organs is unclear).
   Xefros Tritoh
   alludes to sea dwellers having webbed fingers in
   Hiveswap: Act 1
   , but this is never seen in any of their appearances. Troll teeth are sharp, often protrude beyond the lips in a fang-like manner, and
   after being knocked out, a trait displayed by both Equius
   . The appearance of the set of teeth can vary from troll to troll too, with some having completely even teeth, to others having bigger teeth in the upper or lower jaws. Some trolls also have big canines, like Kanaya and Vriska, with the rest being rather small. Apparently higher castes have sharper teeth.

   While trolls are humanoid and possess generally human proportions in nearly all depictions, and while Homestuck's often stylized art direction makes direct comparisons of size difficult, the few
   we do see seem to show that the
   Condesce
   , a fully grown (and ancient) adult troll, is significantly taller than juvenile or even young adult trolls. Excluding her horns, she is 1.5 times as tall as

   . It is unknown if this larger-than-human stature is shared among all adult trolls, is determined by blood color or by the Condesce's extreme age, or if it is something unique to the Condesce herself (although she only
   slightly taller than the fully-grown
   Handmaid

   It is speculated by some that trolls' horns serve as erogenous zones (they are not made of bone, as shown by the troll skeleton above), but the only canon basis is Karkat's
   that it would be typical Gamzee behavior to fondle his horns, and even this instance has the alternative explanations of mere reference to Gamzee's semi-constant state of glassy surrealism, or the horns being Gamzee's actual honking devices. However, in this

   U and non-U English
   . As such, there's probably a similar parallel for troll anatomy - chitinous windhole and protein chute, for example, may correspond to the windpipe and esophagus, respectively.

   Trolls of different blood hues have been

   Trolls can have many different blood colors, ranging from dark red to a more deep fuchsia, covering nearly all of the rainbow's colors. This is referred to as the hemospectrum and serves as the basis of a complex caste system.
For trolls blood color sometimes dictates their life, as seen in Hiveswap teal bloods have to pursue careers similar to lawyers and attorneys, while jade bloods seem to only live in the caverns, though there seems to be only proof of those bloods experiencing those specific jobs, other traits for specific blood colors can affect their choice in career, as well as their place in the hemospectrum, for example, a rust blood can never have a suitable job in most, while a fuchsia or violet blood may have a chance to have, any career they may want

   While it is unknown if this is still the case of adult trolls elsewhere in the interstellar empire, recreation is an important part of the lives of young trolls on the Homeworld.

   Fiduspawn

   battling monsters that hatch out of balls
   . Despite employing real ravenous beasts in its gameplay, this is seen as a somewhat juvenile pastime. Video games also exist on Alternia, usually delivered in the form of biological game storage media known as "game grubs"; a magazine of the same name also exists, paralleling

   Not much is known about Troll eating habits. Nepeta says
   that she hunts "great beasts," presumably lusii, and eats them. This is possibly not the norm, however; in Hiveswap, trolls are shown to consume packaged food stored in a
   thermal hull
   (refrigerator) in a similar manner to humans, rather than hunting for their food in the wild, although their food is often somewhat esoteric. A feature of troll cuisine frequently referenced in Homestuck is a sauce known as
   grub sauce
   , which is described as being similar to mayonnaise in character.
   Charun Krojib
   is stated to eat worms, but it is unknown how common this practice is.
Culled wigglers are often incorporated into various food items.
