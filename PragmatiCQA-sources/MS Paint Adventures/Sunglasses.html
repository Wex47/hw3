   They were initially located in the

   Ben Stiller bust
   blocking the door to
   Problem Sleuth's office

   understandably tried to reach the sunglasses (unsuccessfully) for a full half hour. They were later stolen by unscrupulous whores who tied up and robbed
   Ace Dick

   obtained a pair of sunglasses that bear more than a passing resemblance to the Ben Stiller Bust's. In fact, considering the way GPI used them to view all of creation, it is possible that he somehow came into contact with Nervous Broad and took her glasses, and then increased their size so he could use them.
