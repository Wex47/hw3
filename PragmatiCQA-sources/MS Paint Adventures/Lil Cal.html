   Cal is first introduced as having been part of Dave's upbringing by his bro; however it
   that Dave is severely unnerved by the puppet. This turns out to be partly due to the presence of a copy of Cal in Dave's dream room on

   . Cal is picked up by Baby Dirk, and travels with him on his meteor during
   The Reckoning
   . Due to the
   scratch
   , two iterations of this meteor, and Cal, ultimately come into existence: one which travels to the B1 universe, and another to B2. The first of these iterations arrives with Bro on pre-scratch Earth. This means that the real Cal who torments Dave in his waking hours is, in fact, a future version of the very same Cal who haunts his dreams.

   Initially believed by Dave to be thoroughly awesome, Lil Cal slowly began to both disturb and flip him the fuck out over time. In Dave's defense, Lil Cal has a
   rather unnerving aesthetic
   and initially seems to possess independent mobility, including the ability to appear very suddenly. This movement is, in reality, the work of Dave's bro flash-stepping around and moving Cal as he does so. However, this is later seen happening without the presence of Dave's bro, which has been suggested to be Dave's subconscious mind manipulating Cal in the same way that John and Rose's subconscious minds had them write on their walls. It is unclear how often Cal's movements are controlled by Bro, how often they are controlled by Dave, and how often they are controlled by other means.
  </p>
  <p key="6ca06d55-1ef2-4a62-a9e9-246b168ef74e">
   The effects of Bro's mind games give Dave occasional nightmares in which Cal talks, causing him to wake up in a cold sweat. This is due to Cal's presence on Derse's moon, where he can seemingly move without external force. Cal possesses this ability there because that incarnation of him has (presumably) been animated by Dave's subconscious.
  </p>
  <p key="c5724eee-bf77-4a28-af33-4346110645ac">
   During strife, Bro uses Cal as a weapon, making Cal a part of his supposed
   puppetkind
   abstratus
   . Bro manipulates Cal so that it appears that Cal is fighting with incredible speed and maneuverability. This succeeds in delivering both a physical beatdown and psychological trauma.
