Remembering him getting pushed out of the way before being able to talk to them, he does the same to himself and ends up off the page, presumably onto the gray border of the website.

   It is questionable the effects on the timeline that John's retroactive "un-retcon" of himself made, as him stopping himself from interfering reset the timeline to the way it would originally proceed, with WV dying, but also ends up making the two Johns who keep each other from interfering, removing the situation where he did interfere from ever happening. Paradoxically, this would mean as John never entered Dave and Jade's conversation and would make him never able to know to stop him from doing so. Somehow, retcon powers seem to tie loose ends when it comes to paradoxes and
   not result in any problems
