    Transportalizer
   </b>
   is a pedestal-shaped device used to transport people and objects to other places. The central stairwell of
   Jade's house
   features a series of Transportalizers (

   Skaianet Laboratory
   near

   The post-scratch kids'
   Frog Temple
   contains two transportalizers, one yellow and one purple. They presumably allow travel to Prospit and Derse, which would explain how
   Grandma
   was able to steal the
   fourth wall
   from Derse and bring it to Earth (and, if the transportalizers are in all incarnations of the Temple, would explain how
   Grandpa
   did the same). Another transportalizer was found on
   LOCAH
   , which was also shown to lead to Derse.
