    Sburb
   </b>
   is the human name for a sandbox-style game that takes place superimposed over the real world, rather than in a virtual space. The game is known as

   to the
   trolls
   . In the game, the server player is able to manipulate the client's environment in real time in a manner reminiscent of
   The Sims
   . The client of the game has no need to interact with the computer and can freely roam around completing objectives. Computers are only necessary for interacting with other players and performing actions like downloading Grist with
   GristTorrent
   .

   Actions available to the server player include being able to build rooms, add on to existing rooms, deploy game objects such as the
   Totem Lathe
   , and manipulate objects in the client's environment, though the server player cannot manipulate objects directly affecting the client player. It is said that the server cannot operate outside of a certain radius of the client, however

   Each new client-server connection generates a unique session of the game that is apparently independent of all other sessions, unless a daisy-chain of connections is formed with existing players. The exact number of connections varies depending on the length of the chain in question, though the minimum number of players for a normal session, even if additionally null or void, is two.

   The game appears in each universe through mysterious means. In both the troll and human sessions, one or more meteors had (in another example of disregard for chronology) fallen to Earth hundreds of years before the game began, containing frog temples. On the walls of these temples are hieroglyphs, which can be deciphered to reveal the code for the game. In the kids' session, this was done by
   Jake Harley
   , who then released Sburb through
   his company
   . In the post-scratch troll session, Sollux decoded the glyphs in Aradia's temple, and sent copies of the game to his friends.

   Sburb seems to differ only minorly depending on its players' culture.

More commonly, however, aspects of the game seem to take after human culture. Structures resemble human architecture and Earth geography, and carapacians have human-exclusive qualities like

   A session of Sburb begins long before the players actually run any programs. The paradoxical nature of it allows it to set up certain features on a host planet that enable it to be played at all, such as the presence of each planet's
   First Guardian
   and Frog Temple(s) giving it no true origin. Before beginning the game, players will already have significant parts of their lives be involved in the game's outcomes. Every fully functioning session (that is, every session destined to be won and every
   Null session
   ) will ensure certain features about itself and its players and as such, require them. Deviation from Sburb's rules appears to be integral to the game's experience, to the extent that it is often, ironically, the way that it is meant to be done.

   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="6aad7436-b5b4-44bb-9bf2-ab9fbd51946a">
   Sburb consists primarily of two different sides—the client and the server. Each runs their own separate discs of the game, and connects to the other. The server is able to manipulate the environment around the client in a matter similar to that of The Sims; manipulating the client's house and placing objects from the
   that facilitate the basic functions of Sburb. The game requires a bare minimum of two players to function properly, each acting as each other's server and client player. Despite that, increased amounts of involved players connected through a daisy chain of clients and servers offer a greater variety of items in the phernalia registry, as well as larger amounts of build grist to work with, multiplying by 10 from the base amount of 20.
  </p>
  <p key="9b962fe9-3b54-4e26-8a86-faaa36bf5b57">
   The most important item in the Phernalia registry is the
   Cruxtruder
   . Opening this with great force will provide the player with Cruxite dowels, which can be used with other provided items to alchemize the player's unique
   Cruxite artifact
   ; the item that ultimately allows them to enter the
   Incipisphere
   . Once opened, the Cruxtruder also provides the player with a countdown timer to indicate when a meteor will collide with their house, urging them to enter quickly.
  </p>
  <p key="6504ff2c-53ad-4f65-a90c-5902a322b13e">
   The Cruxtruder also releases a
   Kernelsprite
   —one of Sburb's most integral elements. This can be prototyped up to two times with virtually any item,
   . Once the player enters the Incipisphere, the kernelsprite loses its kernels and becomes a sprite; a guide of sorts for the player with a deep knowledge of Sburb's mechanics. Depending on the items prototyped with the sprite, they can either be
   ,
   , or
   . It is required that the kernelsprite is prototyped at least once before entering in order for the session to function as necessary.

   Grist has a secondary purpose as materials used to facilitate alchemization through the use of the
   Alchemiter
   . This allows the player to create useful items, such as more portable computers or more powerful weapons. (Players tend to

The details of the gates aren't well known, and it is debatable how each gate corresponds to each location. What is evident, however, is that alchemizing tools that enable flight can more or less trivialize the act of building until later on

   Over the course of this progression, the player can explore their land, meet the
   consorts
   living there, and learn about their mythos. They may also find out their own personal quest, which generally has to do with fixing a wrong committed by that planet's denizen: John must unclog the oil in the pipes on his planet and clear the overcast sky, releasing the fireflies his denizen trapped there; Rose must restore underwater life to her planet after her denizen had eaten every living thing, etc. Their denizen will be awoken at some point over the course of this quest. As the player explores and slays enemies, they will ascend the
   Echeladder
   and become stronger. They will also earn
   Boondollars
   , which can be spent primarily on
   Fraymotifs

This grist is meant to be used for the

   Every Sburb player (with few

   exceptions
   ) is a
   paradox clone
   —meaning they are a perfect ectobiological clone that is destined to become the person that is eventually targeted for cloning (i.e. the Alpha Kids), or a descendant of a paradox clone (i.e. the Beta Kids). This cloning is done during sessions, and the resultant children will ride meteors during The Reckoning to their place in the history of their home planet.

   The Scratch
   is a (usually) optional event during Sburb that effectively resets the host universe back to its start. It is initiated when the session's
   Scratch Construct
   (found on the Time player's planet) with the aid of the quills of
   echidna
   ; the Space player's denizen. It is a lengthy and difficult process, as the game will spawn many high level underlings to prevent it from succeeding. The key difference between a pre-scratch and post-scratch sessions is that the order of paradox clones delivered deviates. For the kids' sessions, this means that John, Rose, Dave, and Jade were born as millenials destined to play Sburb, but post-scratch, their ectobiological parents and true paradox clones Jane, Roxy, Dirk, and Jake were the ones that would take their place as Sburb players (albeit under
   ). The remaining generation become the ancestors or guardians of the Sburb players. Since the scratch entirely recreates a universe and its session from its beginning, the players who initiate the scratch will remember nothing of their time before the universe is reset, though naturally, with a
   known exception
   . It is shown, however, that if players escape their universe and session
   through
   some
   means

   Because of the way that the paradox clones are sent to different times, only one session between the pre-scratch and post-scratch session actually has to involve the creation of paradox clones, which is how void sessions are able to exist, given that they rely on their scratch counterpart to initiate The Reckoning
   . Between the two sessions, the one that created the paradox clones is the universe in which Sburb released as a beta, while the session that didn't is the one in which Sburb released as an alpha. This is heavily speculated to be due to
   weird plot shit
   . The pre-scratch session is intended to be the one in which cloning takes place, however a known
   glitch
   in Sburb can cause the post-scratch session to involve cloning, dooming the pre-scratch session to require scratching since it is necessary for the players involved to exist in the first place. The glitch will also result in the post-scratch host planet's first guardian being

   Roxy made some progress on their personal quest on the Land of Pyramids and Neon following the events of [S] GAME OVER, but only through their consultation of their Denizen, Nix. Nix would simply provide the Choice of remaining where they are and facing oblivion in a soon to be doomed timeline, or going to LOWAS and joining John in the new timeline, at the cost of their friends facing the similar loss to the one they have already faced. The result of Roxy's would seemingly manifest with the death of their alternate, post-retcon self. Nothing else is revealed about Roxy's quest.

   Thus it is revealed that the ultimate purpose of Sburb is as a method of procreation for entire universes - a single planet is sacrificed in order to create an entirely new universe (or several are sacrificed for several universes), which may themselves propagate one or more universes, and so on. Therefore, the objective of Sburb is the successful creation of a new universe, which is implied to be the nature of the Ultimate Alchemy.
