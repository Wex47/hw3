   In the year 2422, the
   Wayward Vagabond
   , a carapacian from the kids' session, discovers the buried skyship base at what was once the site of
   Rose's house
   and uses its
   Computer Terminal
   to send messages into John's mind. After accidentally setting off a mysterious timer, the skyship base launches from its bottle-shaped home and flies towards the

   . Over the 413 years since John's meteor crashed, a large white tree formed in its crater. From it grew the helipod base, which the Peregrine Mendicant would find and fly towards the Frog Temple. Part of the base was destroyed after Becsprite percieved PM's messages to Jade and caused the helipod base's terminal to explode, percieving PM as a threat.

   Both PM and WV find the Aimless Renegade guarding the Frog Temple. Using munitions left behind by the Harleys, AR attacks the other exiles, and the ensing scuffle further destroys the ruins of the Frog Temple. The three eventually make friends.

   Some time later, a hovering egg-shaped ship appears in the air above the exiles, falls to the ground, and reveals the fourth exile, the

   When the White Queen uses a special key on a hidden control panel, she triggers the many pieces of the fourth and final station floating in Earth's orbit to recombine into the
   Bec Head Base

  <p key="e5bf30bb-116a-488b-872e-33f0327cd338">
   WQ, now serving as PM's adviser, explains to her that AR must destroy the four stations with Grandpa's explosives, and tells her about the
   Writ Keeper
   , who has been waiting inside the
   Lotus Time Capsule
   in the depths of the Frog Temple.

   WV pulls PM aside and shows her the White Queen's Ring, which he had been hiding inside his spear the entire time. Meanwhile, AR begins rigging the bases with explosives, and WQ waits outside the Lotus Time Capsule for WK. At some point, WV returns to his base and ingests a piece of
   Uranium
   . However, the station's power goes out and traps him inside.

   Immediately after WK emerges from the Time Capsule,

   . He then kills both WQ and WK. AR notices Jack Noir and sets off most of the explosives, destroying almost every base. However, he hesitates to destroy WV's base, because WV is trapped inside. Jack Noir then kills AR to prevent him from destroying the last base. At this point, Noir notices the Red Miles which are destroying the Human Universe, and decides to make an escape. In the process, he also seriously wounds WV by violently reaching inside him and pulling out the
   Uranium
   inside his stomach. Noir uses the Uranium to power the station, and uses a machine within it to travel to the Troll's

   In the aftermath of Noir's rampage, PM puts on the Queen's Ring and transforms into a white version of Noir. She then picks up WV's body and takes him and Serenity with her into the Troll's Incipisphere to chase Noir, leaving Earth behind forever.
