Rose observed that all other Sburb walkthroughs ended before the Medium is reached, probably due to the author's termination by meteor, so she included instructions on how to get into the Medium as quickly as possible. As John's server, she aids John and builds up his house in the first two acts; however, her internet connection was unstable, causing numerous shenanigans. She relies on a connection from the nearby lab which was mysteriously unsecured, but she has to move to her dead cat's mausoleum to get closer to the source of the connection.

   . Rose also would not let Dave join in on these plans, possibly because she wants to be alone with Kanaya, maybe making this a date. After ingesting some strong liquor, Rose went on a walk with Kanaya, and during that, they shared a kiss. Rose then proceded to fall down the stairs. When Rose was drunk and organizing cans for the mayor, Kanaya became angry, prompting Rose to ask if Kanaya was going to break up with her. The answer was an emphatic no, further supporting that Kanaya and Rose are together.

   While Kanaya's emphatic refusal to break up with Rose even in her rage over Rose's drunkenness showed that their relationship possesses the fortitude necessary to survive great hardship and emotional strain, Rose's express of regret (and mention of Kanaya as her girlfriend, even in sobriety) maintains this with even greater certainty and puts to rest doubts that the entire relationship was made possible by Rose's drinking.

   's existence and behavior as absolutely mortifying. She considers her squared-sprite self to be an upsetting funhouse mirror version of herself and can't stand Jasprosesprite^2's talkative, self-absorbed and flirtatious attitude. This is largely due to how the sprite's obvious similarity to herself and how the sprite's behavior reflects on her. Even when Jasprose was merely Rosesprite, Rose found the prototyping of pre-retcon self to be absolutely absurd and nonsensical through the lens of her seering abilities, sending Rose into a fit. Jasprosesprite^2 doesn't appear to have any particular animosity towards Rose, but as she begins to affirm her own identity, she starts to realize that she was very stuffy when she was Rose. This view on her former self may reflect on the Alpha Rose.

   Rose and Jade share a friendship similar to John, but appear to interact less regularly. As Jade and Rose only talk to each other a few times in the comic, not much is known about their friendship. Jade had the unfortunate responsibility of informing Rose of her mother's death.

Rose had also unsuccessfully attempted at acting as auspitice for Terezi and Gamzee's black romance. Post-retcon, the two appear to interact even less, due to Terezi generally oribiting Vriska.
