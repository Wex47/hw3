Pucefoot ruled the death an accident but the senator suspects foul play. Doctor Honeytongue, a former military medic and forensic expert, makes it clear he thinks the senator did it. Berrybreath takes the case. First they visit Pucefoot who confirms that in his expert opinion the death was accidental, but Honeytongue remains convinced that the senator killed his wife and paid off Pucefoot. Berrybreath next visits Duke Pinesnort who admits to having had relations with the senator's wife. He then goes to confront the senator at his hive. The senator greets them with a bag filled with beetles and congratulates Berrybreath for solving the case and inquired if Pinesnort was behind it, and then Berrybreath finds Lemonsnout's insurance policy. It reads "one accidental death good for 2 huge bags of insurance beetles". The senator insists the bag is unrelated but Berrybreath is reaching for his nooses to hang all of them.

While snooping, Terezi finds the Lalonde Family scrapbook, which the two of them read through. Kanaya believes that Rose's violent tendencies growing up were actually just her thriving in trials, not unlike those found in the brooding caverns. Kanaya also finds Rose's violin, which she believes to be a torture device, which Rose used as a musical instrument through human magic. Kanaya demonstrates how Rose would likely play it (albeit poorly), as Terezi compliments her on her torturing prowess.

Jade successfully distracts him, and makes her way to a boulder next to a river, with a flower atop it. Becquerel catches up with Jade and trips her. Sick of Becquerel getting in her way, she asks Rose to throw a ball of yarn out of her window as hard as she can. She does so, and Bec teleports all the way to Rose's house to fetch the yarn ball. Jade successfully climbs the boulder and plucks a glowing seed from it, and Bec returns home.

    . Jeff then arrives nearby "partpy" and exclaims his desire to "keep this frieking thing going forever". After forever goes by, he is seen partying in the room alone, with the image of himself on the shirt grown old, gray, and distorted. Jeff notes that he is still alive, despite everyone else being dead. Jeff prepares himself to set out on a quest of finding "someone new and not dead who will party." Upon turning his frame of view towards the outside of the house, he immediately spots the

    green eyed gray squirrel. Deeming the squirrel "DTP" ("down to party"), he begins to climb out the window. Unfortunately, an upward facing nail within the frame of the windowsill causes the shirt to be ripped right down the center as he climbs over the nail. Jeff is shown torn in two on the ground, gray and mangled like his shirt's image had been. The shirt has been fully recovered, no longer being torn, and with the image the same as when Sweet Bro had originally airbrushed it. The squirrel notices the shirt, dons it for itself, and propels itself away on its own flatulence. Sweet Bro's ghost states the obvious, and the comic questions whether the story has ended. Notably, the shirts of Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff are switched around, possibly representing how even two different types of people can have many similarities.

After Eridan expertly kills it with the rifle, Gamzee begins a discussion with him, questioning why he's so fixated on romantic relationships, and Eridan begins an impassioned speech about how the military history of his lineage is representative of his current degree of romantic passion. Gamzee offers him a sopor slime pie to chill out. After vehemently refusing the pie, Eridan kicks Gamzee out of his land through a gate. Immediately after Gamzee is gone, Eridan remarks how rude it was that Gamzee didn't make more of an effort to stay later.

    The Dolorosa happens upon the Signless, pondering how hard raising a child could possibly be if brainless monsters do it all the time. The young Signless almost immediately gets snatched away by a crocodile-like creature, whom the Dolorosa kills. Unfotunately, then the Signless gets snatched away by a lion creature. The Dolorosa kills this beast as well, and walks further, now visibly paranoid and on guard, brandishing a hacksaw. A massive bird swoops down and takes Signless away, so the Dolorosa climbs a pine tree, pulls it down to the ground, and releases it so it acts as a catapult for its coconuts. A coconut hits the bird square in the gut, and it drops the Signless. Hoping for a soft landing, the Dolorosa runs after him to the spot where he's going to land, which happens to be a cart. The passengers, a greenblooded and blueblooded troll, notice the young Signless and discuss how they could possibly sell him for a large sum of money. Seeing this, the Dolorosa engages Rainbow Drinker mode. The Dolorosa then walks away from the burning wreckage of the cart, and remarks how the Signless is more trouble than he's worth.

    Set in a typical Japanese classroom, the students are mourning the recent death of Damara Megido. Damara herself walks in immediately afterwards apologizing for being late. After class, Cronus chases after Damara. Cronus remarks that she has lost her accent, but she insists that she is the real Damara, and they head towards the embankment where she died. Damara then recounts her accident as they stand on the embankment: Cronus was propositioning her, and when she refused and pushed away from him, she fell. Cronus gets angry, saying it wasn't his fault as she falls once again. The next day, she comes into class again, just as fine as she was before. Cronus, understandably shocked, inquires "Wvhat the hell are you?" Damara responds that she is Damara and writes out a note telling Cronus to meet her after school. When they arrive at the embankment once more, Cronus threatens her, insisting he can keep killing her if he has to. Kurloz and Meulin sneak up behind Cronus and restrain him, and when Damara's eyes are white, she explains to him that he doomed this timeline when he killed her the first time, that only she knows the one true timeline, and that only she knows when and where they really die.

Meanwhile, Jake had run into a ram lusus, which he outran by dashing off the edge of a cliff, miraculously saved from the great fall by a giant flower. Jake, after a moment of thought, concludes that Dirk is pulling his leg about the term being outdated, and Dirk concedes defeat in the conversation.

    Rose tells Dave and WV that she has been keeping track of the days, and that today is Christmas Eve. She tells Dave of her secret Santa plans. They gather together with the trolls, and Kanaya tells Rose about a similar tradition that trolls observed called Secret Sufferer. Kanaya explains that the tradition began in remembrance of the acts of
    the Expatri8
    who allowed the Disciple to continue the teachings of the Sufferer in secret, causing the Expatri8 to get exiled. However, the Sufferer's followers sent dangerous gifts to the highbloods as a reminder that the lessons of the Sufferer were still being taught. It later became a yearly tradition of pity and hatred gifts to close friends and rivals respectively. Karkat remarks that he's glad he doesn't have to do that any more, mentioning one year when Vriska sent out doomsday devices to everyone, all but one of which were faulty, which killed the
    <a href="#Secret_Sufferer" key="720b2709-ed78-400c-8cbb-24a636769912">

    of their group. Rose and Dave explain that it's similar. While Karkat finds the idea lame, Terezi and Kanaya eagerly agree. The meteor enters a dream bubble and everyone is knocked off their feet, and they find themselves on a bright, beachy planet. Meenah greets them, along with
    Mituna

    , and Porrim. After the intermission with "Secret Sufferer Is Comin' To The Municipal Community Gathering Of Citizens", Meenah is asking Rose why she had to bring up kissing traditions, as Cronus tries to convince Latula and Terezi to kiss him while holding up mistletoe. Rose defends herself by saying that she didn't know Cronus would be such a creep. Dave counters by asking her what she was doing with so much mistletoe on the comet in the first point. Rose states the she regrets that part of the tradition, saying that she will find a way to rectify it, as we see Damara kissing WV using mistletoe as well. After "Cherub Charitable", we see Dave talking to Terezi and a few of the

    about how to use Christmas stockings.
    Kankri
    blows his whistle and tries to tell Dave that he's participating in cultural appropriation and complains about it until Dave offers a stocking to him. Kankri accepts the stocking and proceeds to babble about the wonderful gifts it contains before it cuts to "Deck it All". Afterwards, the meteor is exiting the dream bubble, much to the relief of Karkat. The two groups exchange goodbyes, and Karkat later sees a present labeled with his name on the meteor. Opening it, he is enraged to find some of the dancestors inside, celebrating the New Sweep.

      Karkat is seen sends out an angry tirade to the other 11 B2 trolls, stating that he's going to make sure Secret Sufferer is done right this year. All the packages end up at Karkat's house, and he begins groaning about how he has to send them all out himself. His lusus walks in the door and gives Karkat a behemoth shit, smudging the tags, and requiring him to base where he sends the gifts on who he thinks made them. Each troll shows varying degrees of dissatisfaction, except Nepeta and Gamzee. Karkat is then on his computer, who remarks that he wants to wrap this ordeal up. Aradia messages Karkat telling him that he probably realized but their gifts did not make it to the right trolls, but that it was ok, because most of them were enjoying the gifts they got. The last panel shows Karkat flushed in frustration when Aradia tells him that despite the mix-up, it was the best Secret Sufferer they've had.

     The continuing adventures of Lady Grimme as she encounters the Red Knight.

    A young turtle in a book store sees a poster for a new adventure novel, starring Lady Grimme, Casey's character. Casey buys the book for the turtle, and they go off to read it. Inside the book's story, we see Dave's character rambling about being a "

    " while Lady Grimme and Casey are walking by. The three have a short conversation, in which Dave's character reveals himself to be a knight, guarding the land beyond the bridge that Viceroy and Lady Grimme were about to cross. The knight explains his reasoning for wanting to keep gothic wizards outside the area, and Lady Grimme asks the knight to step aside. Strife ensues, during which it's revealed that they have the same birthmark, tying into a piece of lore surrounding missing royal twins meant to defeat the evil King Noir. The knight explains the mission to Lady Grimme, and she agrees to join. Viceroy briefly tries to object, but the turtle's reading session is cut short by an Iguana inviting them to tea.

    Aboard the meteor, Rose tells Dave that she has discovered a collection of Alternian romance novel reviews written by Dave, but he says that they're reviews of Karkat's performances of the books as he reads them aloud to himself every night. Karkat whispers something to Rose, and then openly voices his plan to steal reading material from Equius's belongings. Dave objects, thinking the suffering would be equal for all of them. Karkat explains that he's been desensitized to it, and Dave theorizes that Rose will find the cultural exchange fascinating, which Rose confirms. Dave, believing this to be blackmail in order to get him to stop reviewing, states that he will stop. Rose explains that neither of them want him to stop, revealing that it's blackmail to

    . An Equius in a butler outfit arrives and greets Dave. Dave asks where the island's other butlers are, prompting several other Equiuses to appear nearby and offer Dave towels or glasses of milk. He turns down their offers and instead asks them how their system works: what happens when one of the butlers needs something? Having never considered this question before, the Equiuses begin to debate among themselves, with each one insisting that they alone should serve the other butlers, and the disagreement quickly leads to a brawl. Kanaya, arriving just as the fighting begins, asks Dave what he did to cause this; he tells her that he merely asked them a question.

    The scene begins with a numerous crowd of game sprites in a typical convention-scene, with Nannasprite making an announcement in front of a crowd of other sprites. Nannasprite welcomes everyone to the Spritecon, and reports that there will be a number of panel time and location changes in the con's schedule, but refuses to clarify for the audience, seeing no fun to be had in it. The sprites show disappointment and anger, but Nannasprite insists on them figuring it out themselves. Davesprite takes over the stand to address the agitated sprites, and tells them that even though its of the sprites' nature to be coy with information, he insists the con will go smoothly, and he gives them the new schedules. The convention goes on as planned, but when Nannasprite refuses to give out information of where the next con is, an agitated Davesprite, and gives up after he finds out the planning committee consists of Poppopsprite, Nannasprite, Sassacresprite, and a famous detective/riddler.

     A great number of trolls go to summer camp.

    The story opens up as an alternate universe, in which Karkat and the other A2 trolls, except for Aradia, attend summer camp at camp

    . The AU is revealed to take place in a friendfiction script which Karkat wrote, and is making Dave read. In the story, the trolls state their opinions on the idea of going to summer camp. Dave boredly skips over lines of dialog, and reads certain revisions from troll culture to human culture aloud, leading to conflict between Dave and the real Karkat. The story trolls have romantic interests and conflicts set up as they choose which
    <s key="65b287d6-ee73-4987-a4b8-adadacac20bf">

    </s>
    beds to sleep in. They then meet counselor Bro, and his sentient hand puppet
    Big Cal
    . The inaccurate portrayal of Bro causes the real Dave and the real Karkat to bicker. Karkat's expert storytelling reveals that there was an incident at camp last summer, and sends the trolls to the (artificial lakeside) beach for more character development, which Dave partially skips over via montage. It is later revealed that the incident in question involved a camper dying. The trolls also meet humans from the rival camp, who are OCs based off of Dave, Sweet Bro, Hella Jeff, and Geromy. This, of course, leads to even more arguing between the real Dave and Karkat, including Dave ripping the story in half. The script is taped back together off-panel. After rapping and insulting Camp SGRUB, the "Sburbs" are scared off by Cal. Later, at the campfire, Vriska asks Bro about a secret treasure which Dave had referenced in his rap, and Bro responds with obligatory mythos. Later, while Bro sleeps, Feferi offers Drugs (brand root beer) to the group, and they all decide to "Do Drugs" in the woods, except for Tavros, Eridan, and Gamzee. Vriska deliberately set this up to go treasure hunting. They find a map to the treasure, and a dead Aradia, who warns them of

    . Meanwhile, at the cabin, Tavros is distracted by Sweet Jeff and Hella Bro, as Dave Slider convinces Eridan to defect to Camp SBURB, while also stealing Cal. A chase scene occurs between the monster and Drugs enthusiasts, which Dave skips over. Since the skip worked so well, he skips to the climax, in which SGRUB is sold to SBURB for zero dollars, and

    </a>
    is placed in the SGRUB cabin. Equius and Sollux also defect during this time. Eridan rejoins and Sollux disarms the bomb, as Tavros and Slider have a sick rap battle for the possession of Cal. Vriska attempts to keep the treasure to herself, until Terezi convinces her to buy back Camp SGRUB with it. Bearjack reappears, killing Sweet Jeff and reactivating the bomb, which Eridan disposes of. Nepeta murders Bearjack, and Camps SBURB and SGRUB merge into Camp SBURG. To celebrate, everyone throws a barbecue. However, the scene is edited out by Future Karkat, who goes on a long rant about the blatant wish-fulfillment in everyone's storyline, insulting Past Karkat the whole time. Past-Karkat agrees that there is wish-fulfillment in the script, but decides that it's harmless to make a universe where everyone's a little happier.
