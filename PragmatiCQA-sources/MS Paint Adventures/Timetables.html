   possesses a similar set of objects, known as her Music Box Time Machine. While Dave's timetables are built on red gears, reminiscent of the ones in the
   Land of Heat and Clockwork
   , Aradia's devices appear to be the comb and cylinder of a music box encased in large quartz rocks, reminiscent of her own
   Land of Quartz and Melody
   . Just as Dave spins the records to travel through time, she presumably revolves the cylinder forwards or backwards to move along the time stream.

   In the original (pre-retcon) timeline,
   Gamzee
   is the final owner of the Music Box Time Machine as of
   . He uses it to travel through time in the B2 session, presumably going back in time from his arrival on the meteor to visit Jane and possibly traveling to the future to raise Caliborn and Calliope (although his means of arrival on their planet have been as of yet unclear, and time travel with the Music Box is only one theory).

   When Vriska reaches the Alpha Kids' Medium in the post-retcon session with the meteor, she uses the Music Box Time Machine to go back in time and advise the Alpha Kids on how to prototype
   . While Vriska did bring objects such as the refrigerator which held the corpses of the dead trolls with her, it's most likely that these turntables can't transport other sentient beings.

    It seems like Timetables are strongly tied to music (it seems logical, since music is strongly tied to time and rhythm): Dave's Timetables resemble records, and Aradia's look like a music box.

    A Time player's timetables generally seem to resemble their session's

    . Or perhaps by the whims of

    The question of whether items like the timetables actually have intrinsic power can be debated.

    that, rather, such items (in that case, Rose's
    Thorns of Oglogoth
    ) only channel innate abilities of the player that wields them. Rose, for example, could use the Needles due to her connection with the Horrorterrors, and Dave can time-travel as a Hero of Time. However, Gamzee and Vriska both being able to use the Music Box Time Machine appears to invalidate this claim, since neither have any time-traveling powers of their own.
