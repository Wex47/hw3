   Jane believes the creature doesn't have a name, and as such she and her friends refer to it as GCat for short. This name's connection to the four nitrogen bases that form DNA (Guanine, Cytosine, Adenine and Thymine), not only connects it to the naming convention of the various
   online handles
   , but also, more delicately, to how the DNA sequence involved in Bec's creation was recorded with a substitution of these letters by those used in the word

   Prior to the
   Alpha Kids'
   entry into the Medium, GCat is seen performing various esoteric and often inexplicable actions on post-scratch Earth. While it interacts mostly with Jane, it does not do so exclusively. GCat appears to possess a capricious spirit, hindering the kids' efforts as much as it appears to aid them. Whether this attests to anything about GCat's own nature or the general independence of cats as opposed to dogs is unknown.

   GCat had been interfering with Jane's life for years prior to her playing Sburb, including an incident in which GCat teleported her into a random field on the other side of town
   . Whilst this action is definitely unhelpful, GCat later saves her life twice, although this could be more due to a necessity to fulfill the conditions of a timeline in which Jane does not die and thus secure its own existence than due to loyalty to Jane. Jane states that he often vanishes from her life for weeks at a time.
