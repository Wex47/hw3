   Problem Sleuth

   Mobster Kingpin is a gruff lout who doesn't take anything from nobody, see? He rules his city with an iron fist. While Mobster Kingpin is in charge of this city, oddly enough he has to
   overcome the same trials
   as
   Team Sleuth
   , such as having to find a way out of his office, (which appears to be in the lower deck of the
   Chicago Overcoat
   ) and passing a
   Quest of Spirit
   . He has no qualms about making passes at
   Nervous Broad
   and no sympathy for
   Hysterical Dame
   if she doesn't do what he says. His stats vary, as he has the ability to max out any stat randomly by using his Battle Technique: RUNNING NUMBERS. What makes Mobster Kingpin a real threat is his very powerful
   Combat Operandi
   and
   Battle techniques
   that not only nullify but counter attacks coming to him.

   While MK's stats are impressive, he has several known flaws. The two weaknesses he has shown are his
   Blood Sugar
   and
   Emotions
   . The higher these gauges rise, the more damage MK takes and the faster he is beaten. If these are not high enough, Mobster Kingpin is invulnerable to nearly all attacks and when struck makes a highly odd "Fwank" sound.

   Black Hole Mobster Kingpin is the resulting form of Mobster Kingpin after tightening his Gravity Brassier to such a degree that his mass increased several orders of magnitude, and his volume reduced sufficiently to allow him to fall entirely within his own Schwarzschild radius. Thanks to the
   laws of physics
   , in this form he appears to have become entirely invulnerable, as his mass has become too great to move by conventional means, and any attacks would simply be swallowed into his event horizon.

   to get the electric current to the giant fan faster, Black Hole Mobster Kingpin would be once again vulnerable for a time, since he would no longer fall under his (now much smaller) Schwarzschild radius. However, seeing as BHMK is now more massive than the entire universe, it seems much more likely that the size of the universe will become smaller, rather than the speed of light becoming larger.

   Black Hole Mobster Kingpin continually pulls on the Gravity Brassier's drawstrings until his mass is a whopping googolplex. This causes him to become an ultra-massive black hole (which might not even be a real term). Mobster Kingpin was pushed out of the brassier when
   the Moon
   gently landed on his hat as he erupted out of
   Mount Saint Lardass
   and landed on the
   Ham Needle
   , killing him once and for all and destroying the black hole.

   MK holds the
   Megaton Key
   , which leads to the Real World next to Team Sleuth's offices. Leaving to go and Sleuth the Real World is the goal of the game. While it is true that only the strongest man on earth can wield the key, it does not indicate exactly how heavy it is. MK was the strongest man on earth when he was wielding the key, so it makes sense that he can wield it. Due to the
   troublesome nature
   of
   specific items and weapons
   , it's most likely the case that when
   Ace Dick
   became the strongest man on earth, (Therefore MK could no longer wield it) that the key was in its other state, the Brass Knuckles. Only when MK finally dropped the item did it turn into the key.
