   . In the game, the server player is able to manipulate the client's environment in real time in a manner reminiscent of
   The Sims
   . The client of the game has no need to interact with the computer and can freely roam around completing objectives. Computers are only necessary for interacting with other players and performing actions like downloading Grist with
   GristTorrent
   .

   Actions available to the server player include being able to build rooms, add on to existing rooms, deploy game objects such as the
   Totem Lathe
   , and manipulate objects in the client's environment, though the server player cannot manipulate objects directly affecting the client player. It is said that the server cannot operate outside of a certain radius of the client, however

   Each new client-server connection generates a unique session of the game that is apparently independent of all other sessions, unless a daisy-chain of connections is formed with existing players. The exact number of connections varies depending on the length of the chain in question, though the minimum number of players for a normal session, even if additionally null or void, is two.

   The game appears in each universe through mysterious means. In both the troll and human sessions, one or more meteors had (in another example of disregard for chronology) fallen to Earth hundreds of years before the game began, containing frog temples. On the walls of these temples are hieroglyphs, which can be deciphered to reveal the code for the game. In the kids' session, this was done by

   Sburb consists primarily of two different sides—the client and the server. Each runs their own separate discs of the game, and connects to the other. The server is able to manipulate the environment around the client in a matter similar to that of The Sims; manipulating the client's house and placing objects from the
   that facilitate the basic functions of Sburb. The game requires a bare minimum of two players to function properly, each acting as each other's server and client player. Despite that, increased amounts of involved players connected through a daisy chain of clients and servers offer a greater variety of items in the phernalia registry, as well as larger amounts of build grist to work with, multiplying by 10 from the base amount of 20.

   As players build up each others houses, they gain access to higher gates, which will thusly grant them access to each other's worlds; one's own second gate taking them to their server's house, the third gate to a random part of their server's world, and the fourth gate to their server's server's house, continuing onwards. The details of the gates aren't well known, and it is debatable how each gate corresponds to each location. What is evident, however, is that alchemizing tools that enable flight can more or less trivialize the act of building until later on

The key difference between a pre-scratch and post-scratch sessions is that the order of paradox clones delivered deviates. For the kids' sessions, this means that John, Rose, Dave, and Jade were born as millenials destined to play Sburb, but post-scratch, their ectobiological parents and true paradox clones Jane, Roxy, Dirk, and Jake were the ones that would take their place as Sburb players (albeit under
   ). The remaining generation become the ancestors or guardians of the Sburb players. Since the scratch entirely recreates a universe and its session from its beginning, the players who initiate the scratch will remember nothing of their time before the universe is reset, though naturally, with a
   known exception

   Because of the way that the paradox clones are sent to different times, only one session between the pre-scratch and post-scratch session actually has to involve the creation of paradox clones, which is how void sessions are able to exist, given that they rely on their scratch counterpart to initiate The Reckoning
   . Between the two sessions, the one that created the paradox clones is the universe in which Sburb released as a beta, while the session that didn't is the one in which Sburb released as an alpha. This is heavily speculated to be due to

   . The pre-scratch session is intended to be the one in which cloning takes place, however a known
   glitch

   is implied to be responsible for this. John's quest, phrased as a riddle, was to journey to the place where "constellations danced beneath the clouds," and to free the stars from the shade and release them into heaven. The "stars" refer to the fireflies that inhabit LOWAS, trapped under the clouds. To clear them, John had to travel to his denizen's palace, which resembles a large pipe organ, and
   on the organ within.

  <p key="572bd26c-b5b0-42bf-b87f-9e789cbfc235">
   However, John's quest had two stages. Before he could use the pipe organ, he first had to clear the oil that had covered his planet and clogged all the pipes. To do that, he had to face his denizen, and presumably ask him to clear the oil.

  <p key="e7867f1f-d4a5-4dc0-afcf-770cd74b3e24">
   It is unknown how the issue of the oil would have resolved itself had he requested this from his denizen: rather, John came to Typheus asking for help mastering his retcanon powers, and, in the process of that, banished the oil from existence on LOWAS and

To restore life in the oceans, Rose must "play the rain," meaning that she must play a song whose notes form the musical analogue to a genetic code that will make life possible again.

   Out of all the kids, Rose is the one who has done the least progress on her planet quest. She seems to be disinterested in it entirely, and has instead spent a large amount of time navigating her planet, attempting to find ways to break the game.

   Due to their status as Nobles (instead of Heroes) in a Void session, Jane, Dirk, Jake and Roxy had very minimal personal quests. What little is known about their quests is largely encompassed by the fact that their session is entirely inert, save from divine intervention from the arrival of the four pre-scratch kids, forcing the post-scratch kids, and by extension, the entire session, to lay in wait. All four of their lands are themes around death and noble gases, with emphasis on how stagnant and inert the nature of the session is. All the consorts are dead and all the enemies are skeletal undead monsters, and seemingly only appear after the arrival of all four players. None of the pre-scratch kids would make much headway in their personal quests, aside from Jane and Roxy in various measures.

   On Jane's planet, the Land of Crypts and Helium, the aspect of infertility and the awaited arrival of life are constantly referred to, with lush flora growing just visibly out of reach under the planet's surface, occasionally breaking through the soil. Jane would partially accomplish this through the augmented abilities she gain by unlocking Trickster Mode. Half of her planet would be suddenly covered in lush, tangled plant-life. This overgrowth would show visible signs of decay later on, possibly indicating that Jane's sudden power-up was not intended as part of her quest.

   Roxy made some progress on their personal quest on the Land of Pyramids and Neon following the events of [S] GAME OVER, but only through their consultation of their Denizen, Nix. Nix would simply provide the Choice of remaining where they are and facing oblivion in a soon to be doomed timeline, or going to LOWAS and joining John in the new timeline, at the cost of their friends facing the similar loss to the one they have already faced. The result of Roxy's would seemingly manifest with the death of their alternate, post-retcon self. Nothing else is revealed about Roxy's quest.

   Thus it is revealed that the ultimate purpose of Sburb is as a method of procreation for entire universes - a single planet is sacrificed in order to create an entirely new universe (or several are sacrificed for several universes), which may themselves propagate one or more universes, and so on. Therefore, the objective of Sburb is the successful creation of a new universe, which is implied to be the nature of the Ultimate Alchemy.

    The color of the Sburb/Sgrub logo seems to correspond with the most important player in the session. In the pre-scratch kids' session, this was Jade, while in the post-scratch trolls' session it was Gamzee. The post-scratch kids' logo is red, implying that Dave or Karkat will be the most important player. However, it is worth noting that the Auto-Responder and Dirk's rapbots are also associated with the color red, and it is also possible that the most important character in the session may be considered to be Caliborn, even though he is not a player in it. After the events of the End of Act 6 Act 5, Jane is also associated with the color red, considering her outfit, text color and eyes have changed to this color.
