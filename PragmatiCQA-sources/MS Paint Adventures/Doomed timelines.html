A doomed timeline is created when a person fails to do what they are supposed to do causing the entire timeline and its inhabitants to be doomed. Interaction between doomed timelines and
   other universes
   is prevented; however a person can travel back in time from the doomed timeline and avert the timeline from ever being created. In fact this is at times necessary to succeed, meaning a doomed timeline has to exist in order to ensure its own non-existence.

   Three doomed timelines have been shown in the kids' session. However, there were likely others due to Dave's remarks about dead copies of himself. It is also possible that if that timeline did not affect the alpha timeline, none of the alpha players would be aware of its existence, and it would therefore have no bearing on the story. Of the three known, two were directly caused by Terezi. This stands to reason, as she is a Seer of Mind, and her role is to explore various possible outcomes.

   Only one doomed timeline has been referred to so far in regards to the cherubs. In this timeline, Calliope's abstination from communicating and bonding with the kids allowed her to predominate over Caliborn. This instance of Calliope reached the god tiers but ended up dying eventually, most likely due to the Muse's version of The Choice involving sacrificing themselves to stop an uncontrollable tyrant/Lord and become a martyr that would benefit all who lived.

   This was the result of the Condesce controlling Grimbark Jade and Crockercorp Jane, and when the stardust in the cartridge that Caliborn inserted glitched the timeline, resulting in the deaths of many characters. Many lives were lost, but this was prevented in the retcon.
