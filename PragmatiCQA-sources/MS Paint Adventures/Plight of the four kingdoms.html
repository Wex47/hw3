    The weasels are an aggressive race of anthropomorphic creatures. They dwell in the
    salted melon
    fields. They are known for
    flipping the fuck out
    , and their
    king
    is the most practiced in this ability. The weasels crave
    elven eggs
    , and go on periodic raids into elf territory for them. The weasels' representative at the negotiations is the
    Weasel Emissary
    .

    The elves are known for their cunning and intuition. They are perhaps the most clandestine of the four kingdoms. Elves can grant wishes, provided you give them enough
    . Elves have an unusual lust for the pies created by the clowns; they will steal them right off the clowns' windowsills. The elven representative at the negotiations is the
    Elf Exemplar

    The hogs are the most unappealing of the four kingdoms. Their
    Pulchritude
    is considerably low, and will only associate with
    characters
    who are equally as low. The hogs sustain themselves on salted melons; however,
    their kingdom is so muddy
    and unappealing that the melons refuse to grow there. Thus, they must gather their supply from the weasels. The hogs' representative at the negotiations is the
    Hog Provost

    The clowns are the most presumptuous of the four. They excel in song, dance, and piemaking. Their primary source of entertainment is to pick on the hogs by slapping them on the behind and watching them squeal. Only a

   The Weasel King charges
   Problem Sleuth
   with handling the negotiation and arbitration of the situation. To aid him in this task, he arms Problem Sleuth with the
   Tectrix of the Arbitor
   and appropriate attire (It looks pretty ridiculous). As the
   Weasel Emissary

   Elf Exemplar

   Hog Provost
   look on, Problem Sleuth, armed with the Tectrix, must use the Allegiance Mesh and appropriate negotiation strategies to hammer out a treaty between the four kingdoms. Despite his best efforts, Problem Sleuth can't figure out the complete
