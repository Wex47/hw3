    Windows
   </b>
   are physical portals between the normal world and the
   imaginary universe
   . Windows have a number of special properties that can be useful in solving puzzles:

   <li key="c79a9eda-b155-428d-9ee4-acf702aa8c93">
    If a window is unplugged while an object is partway through, the object will be severed at the plane of the window's pane, due to the unpowered side no longer existing or being "On". Anyone on the unpowered side of a window may meet some interesting
    friends

    Windows may be moved freely, even while the window is active (up to the limit of the power cord's extent, of course).

   Windows may manifest as objects that would not typically be described as windows, such as mirrors or traffic light lenses. They are often glass surfaces but many exceptions occur such as the
   bodices
   , jacuzzi, the back of the trucks, and the occasional random magical portal as the result of a flying carousel.
