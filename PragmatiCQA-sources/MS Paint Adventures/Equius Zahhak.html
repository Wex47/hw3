   Equius is a complicated and initially disturbing troll. He is a firm believer in the
   blood caste system
   , believing one should respect those higher than them and be personally disgusted by those who are lower (such as those on the

   ). He believes one is not only allowed, but obligated to boss around anyone who is lower-ranked than them and to accept and obey orders from anyone who is higher-ranked. He believes "highbloods" should act with elegance and authority and "gutterbloods" should act with crass and submission, and most importantly, highbloods and gutterbloods should not fraternize. Any deviation from this pattern (such as Gamzee and Aradia's actions) flusters him greatly. He tries ordering highbloods to order him around, but notices the contradiction. He tries to keep up with many aristocratic practices, and has dabbled in slam poetry (mostly about his strange fetishes).

   Equius has a tendency to quickly fly into a rage about practically everything. He is only able to express his rage by building robots, setting them to "Kill Mode," and smashing the shit out of them with staggering quantities of violence. In a pinch, other acts of destruction will do, such as when Aradia throws a

   Equius is freakishly strong, and has trouble controlling his strength; under his touch, bows snap, glasses break, and his exceptionally strong lusus

   He seems to enjoy the concept of domination, admiring his own strength, as well as the clout that his blue blood gives him over the lesser blood colors. However, it would seem that he would prefer to be dominated by the few trolls that occupy a caste higher than his own, or by anyone lower-classed who acts with a manner refined enough that it confuses him. He even went so far as to make an artificial heart which pumps blue blood for Aradia.

   Equius has an obsessive crush on Aradia and created a robotic body for her upon request (complete with artificial passion for him programmed onto an artificial heart that pumps indigo blood). But this may have been Vriska's

Later on, he was upset about how Aradia had become his superior (being his server player and thus in control of his physical environment) but then took perverse pleasure in being dominated by her, even ceding the leadership title to her.
   His relationship with Aradia is hard to define, like much of troll romance, but his feelings tend to lean more towards the flushed quadrant. They were, however, together romantically. In the

Equius could possibly have saved himself easily, but he was killed because he would rather uphold the caste system, feed his own fetish, or perhaps uphold a pacifist idealism (as he shows towards the idea of
