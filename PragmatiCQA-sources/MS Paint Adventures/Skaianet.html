   . On the surface, these breakthroughs are due to Sassacre and the many scientists throughout Europe he has recruited into the company through his foundation, the Distinguished Gentleman's League of Intellectuals and Luminaries. In reality, however, Sassacre and his fellow gentlemen are merely faces for a laundering scheme, wherein the Condesce is developing and releasing adapted Alternian and Sburbian technology over time. Twain selected the 16 year old
   Einstein
   as his protege in 1895, and Einstein advanced the company's laundering methods significantly, as well as spreading its presence in Europe.
