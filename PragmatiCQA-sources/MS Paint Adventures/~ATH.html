   ~ATH is an apparently insufferable language to work with. Its logic is composed of nothing but infinite loops, or at best, loops of effectively interminable construction.

   The only straightforward way to get anything done with ~ATH is to use the EXECUTE statement. However, EXECUTE statements may only be placed at the end of the eponymous ~ATH loops. The loop's life is bound to that of a specified object, and will not terminate until that object dies. In the above example, the loop is bound to the program's life, so there is no way to break the loop and continue execution. However, ~ATH allows the user to import other objects from a rather large library, such as the author and the universe. Like

   This shows that ~ATH code is apparently color-sensitive, a fact of which Karkat was skeptical.

   The program, when run, causes the computer to explode and places a curse on its user, everyone he knows, and everyone he will ever meet. Examining the source code, the program appears to split itself into two: one blue, and one red. (~ATH do we part?) It then imports two instances of the universe. What follows is inscrutable: the indentation and coloration suggests that the ~ATH blocks overlap in a manner that is entirely unlike any normal programming language.
  </p>
  <p key="c718755d-1839-4508-a0c3-dc408ca77ba9">
   A possible interpretation: The red code waits for the death of the universe (U1), then waits for the blue code to end. The blue code waits for the death of "!U2" (i.e., the opposite of the universe or perhaps, since ~ATH code runs til death, the negation indicates "upon the creation of" or the death of U2's nonexistence), which has no immediately discernible meaning, then waits for the red code to end. The lines are twisted in such a way that the program can't finish executing until the universe both stops and starts existing at the same time, which apparently makes the computer explode. As Karkat puts it, Sollux is "obnoxiously good" at ~ATH.

   According to Andrew's Formspring, U1 is the trolls' universe and U2 is the kids' universe, and the program in some way represents the relationship between the two. However, it is notable that it could also mean the Pre-Scratch and Post-Scratch universes, as they are destroyed and created at the same time, thus validating the code, as the Double Mobius Reacharound that Vriska used to blind Terezi was also valid. Whether the execution of the virus actually caused certain events within Homestuck or merely foreshadowed them is unknown. It should be noted that "
   Universe
   " is also a term of art within mathematics (and programming languages often utilize mathematical concepts) used to refer to the set of all mathematical objects with which one is going to work with mathematically.
