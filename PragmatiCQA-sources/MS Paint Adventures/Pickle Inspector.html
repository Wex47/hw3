   Pickle Inspector is a somewhat socially awkward acquaintance of both
   Problem Sleuth
   and
   Ace Dick
   . He first appears in
   , seen in
   his office
   while Problem Sleuth is spying on him. While he is physically rather weak, his enormous
   Imagination
   stat is quite useful in the
   imaginary universe
   , where he can conjure

   Pickle Inspector is a bit more off kilter than his two compatriots, and when we initially discover him he is trapped in his office like the others, albeit a bit farther along than Problem Sleuth in that he is already hiding in his

   </a>
   . Despite him being an Inspector, he has no phone with which to field calls from
   Nervous Broads
   , and it may bring to question why he's there or even why he's an Inspector in the first place. Pickle Inspector lacks the Hard-Boiled mentality of the other two Sleuths, and is very polite and mannerly as he goes about his business. Pickle Inspector is not a complete ninny, however, and will take any female attention he can get, even if they're conjured from his own
   Imagination
   . When
   Problem Sleuth
   visits him from the
   imaginary universe
   , he gives a disgruntled look and bars his door shut with solid steel. It appears that Pickle Inspector had no real plans to really try to get out of his
   office
   . That is, until you take control of him and mess it all up.

    Pickle Inspector's Statistics:
   </b>
   Pickle Inspector has terrible
   Vim
   and
   Pulchritude
   statistics, giving him little to no use in most cases in the real world, and serves as an effective pack mule to carry non-essential items. However, he has secondary traits that give him an advantage over the other two sleuths. He has a very good
   Height
   attribute—in fact, the highest natural one—and can make use of it to reach for items not usually accessible. His other helpful trait is his
   Etiquette Monstrance
   , which holds seven of possible nine Mannercite Shards, and his polite demeanor allows him to modify his meager
   Pulchritude
   , providing him with an alternate means of solving

   others
   to do it for him.

   Fortunately, since most of the danger in the game is involved within the
   imaginary universe
   , Pickle Inspector is more at ease there with his variety of
   Imagination
   -based abilities. He is able to summon

   based objects, which can be used for support and offense. While Pickle Inspector usually does not directly involve himself in fighting, and tends to run away when feeling disconcerted, his support has kept Team Sleuth alive on more than one occasion through the provision of arms and armor that are more suitable for use in that realm.

   he has been busily going his usual rate of 6 feet per year to reach objects to interact with, giving him not much chance to execute
   Combat Operandi

   Battle techniques
