   The name Horuss is a play from "
   Horus
   ", the Egyptian god of the sky, war and hunting, and the word "horse". Horuss is the god of many things, and this may be a reference to Horuss being a "troll Renaissance man". Horus was also conceived by the use of a golden phallus, so the name may tie in to the Zahhaks' phallic associations.

   Horuss is polite, mindful of cursing, interested with horses, and makes references to sweat much like his dancestor. He also tends to unsettle those around him with his odd interests and tendencies, again, like his dancestor. He has also taken it upon himself to be more optimistic in order to abide by the wishes of Meulin, and makes an effort to please others and talk more openly and freely about his feelings. While he takes to this task with gusto and only reverts to his older, gloomier self when ordered to by Meenah, Horuss doesn't quite perform chipper friendliness properly, as he has a bad habit of talking over others, especially his matesprit Rufioh who often cannot get a word in edgewise. This is a stark contrast with Equius, who talked little throughout the story prior to his death and in a terse, severe tone on all occasions.
  </p>
  <p key="6ca7b46b-7c57-4736-9f41-3160a0a4be6f">
   He also believes that he is a being consisting of multiple entities (which he sometimes refers to as "souls") that simultaneously are him and separate beings inhabiting his body, including the souls of at least two ancient legendary musclebeasts, various kinds of devices including hivehold appliances, planets, star systems, several universes, abstract concepts which no language can describe, and at least one "soul" from Alterniasia (which he believes helps him understand Damara's language).
  </p>
  <p key="b85d7141-646d-40c5-a1d9-6fe6f92ec3c8">
   He also used to think that those lower on the hemospectrum of him were not worth his time before he befriended Rufioh in the woods where the Lost Weeaboos lived. Unlike Equius, he got angry at those lower than him and scared Rufioh with his contempt for him and Damara. He primarily associated with cobalt, indigo, and purple-blooded trolls before he befriended Rufioh. In the dreambubbles, while he still sometimes acts rude to those lower than him by calling them "peasants", he is far more willing to treat them with respect than he used to be. Also, he still treats starting romantic relationships with someone significantly up or down on the hemospectrum like a scandalous act, despite his loving relationship with Rufioh, and he was embarrassed when others found out he and Rufioh were matesprits.

  <p key="cdb89e1d-01cf-4a35-a6da-f070ca8f1e48">
   He deeply respects Equius, Nepeta, as well as their moirallegiance, and became moirails with Meulin, who he previously didn't care about, after being inspired by their story.

   , which started in secret before the trolls started their session while Rufioh was still dating Damara. However, Rufioh is unhappy with the relationship and it appears that he is moving to end it. Rufioh seems somewhat annoyed and disturbed by Horuss's multiple identities. At the moment, Horuss is "unaware" of any coming breakup, or indeed any tension at all.

   The connection between
   Damara
   and Horuss is largely obscured, but Damara is said to constantly warn Rufioh of the weakness of his matespritship. Horuss is unable to have meaningful conversations with her, since he cannot understand her lowblood speak. She frequently teases him with lewd, flirtatious remarks, and even offers to have sex with him although Horuss has trouble understanding most of it.

   While Meulin and Horuss are fairly loving towards one another, their relationship is far from perfect. Horuss often has trouble understanding Meulin's mimes. Meulin actively teaches Horuss to suppress his anger and other negative emotions at all times and substitute it for a happier attitude instead. He smiles a lot because of what Meulin taught him about emotions, even when it's physically painful for him. However, he doesn't seem resentful of Meulin whatsoever.
