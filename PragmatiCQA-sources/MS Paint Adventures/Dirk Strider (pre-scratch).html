His apartment has many hidden webcams in it, which seem to be set to record any disconcertingly erotic event involving puppets in the area. Interestingly, not all of bro's puppets are hip-hop-based and a good number of them seem to have more to do with sex than rapping; many are nude, except for skimpy leather clothing, and a lot of pictures feature oddly censored out areas.

Dirk also shows a higher degree of ninja speed than previously expected, as he is able to not only predict but counter all of Dave's attacks ahead of time at one point, making it appear that he is fighting when it's really just an after-image that Dave battles while Bro waits safely on the sidelines. Dirk is the only guardian to blatantly attack his charge.

   Within the Medium, Dirk has been seen taking on and presumably wrecking the shit of a massive tentacled underling. He later battles with
   Jack Noir
   after Jack slaughters
   The Armies of Light and Darkness
   and destroys the chain that attaches
   Prospit
   to its moon. They battle upon the giant
   Beat Mesa
   , and they seem almost matched in power. Dirk plunges his sword into the platform, causing it to crack. It is later revealed that he most likely attempted to initiate the scratch.

   to get to
   John's house

   After Jade's entry to the Medium, Jack Noir's fourth prototyping unfortunately allows him to kill Dirk and injure Davesprite with ease. He puts on Dirk's shades and takes Lil Cal. Interestingly, Dirk is impaled with his own sword, which
   <a href="Rambunctious Crow.html" key="fd365743-561b-45c2-b10a-d1074d8f3014" title="Rambunctious Crow">
    goes through his chest
   </a>
   and into the floor of the platform he was on, indicating Jack killed him while he was already down as well as echoing Dirk's previous actions where he absconded with his sword impaled in the Beat Mesa. Dave later told Jade he knew about Dirk's demise, explaining that he always felt like he had a really strange relationship with his Bro/Dad, but it amounted to a kind of kinship in a way. Dave also said when he found Dirk's body, he thought about taking the sword, but felt it was too weird and decided to leave it where it was. Although later, in a conversation with Terezi, he claims it would be easier and cleaner to take out horizontally and launches off of it in a attempt to prove it and then just lays there with his shades aside, presumably in his form of mourning.

   with them. His collection includes both paintings of them and various marionettes, dressed in super cool gangster/pimp clothing. In contrast to John and Rose's disgust for their guardians' obsessions, Dave thought his Dirk's puppets were very cool, but has mentioned to Rose that they're starting to unsettle him. Bro has one signature ventriloquism puppet he uses to rap and is never far from:

   . He enjoys playing mind games and is stealthy like a ninja. He is a master of different kinds of Modi. He knows how to
   weaponize a Sylladex
   , and according to Dave, the two brothers often have "hashrap" battles, where they insert keywords into rap to launch the contents of their sylladices at each other.

   Dirk seemed to lack any sense of self-awareness or empathy in his methods in preparing Dave for Sburb, such as his tendency to deprive Dave of food and deliver constant physical abuse, which Dave later describes as
   in nature and believes he saw raising a child as a game. He holds martial prowess and fighting above all else besides puppets, as he started Dave's training when he was just a baby. Many of his interactions with Dave only involve violence and his constant poker face is never broken by body language, to the point that Dave likens him to a robot. It's also implied that Lil Cal's influence played some factor into his behavior.

   Aside from rapping and over the top violence, Dirk also took to creating chatbots that he would have autonomously bid for his obtuse smuppet pornography as a means to generate money. According to Dave, these chatbots would always be almost, but not quite at the precipice of becoming self-aware. His post-scratch self likened the hobby to taking care of a flock of pigeons. This predilection towards creating intelligent programs is not dissimilar to his post-scratch's own vested interests in robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as his creation of his self-aware Auto-Responder.
