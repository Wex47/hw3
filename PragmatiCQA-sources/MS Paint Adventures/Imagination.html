   as a measurement of a character's ability to manipulate the

   . The stat reflects the limitations of their imaginations in the world, as well as the ease of which they can change the imaginary world. Using one's imagination, the characters can control matter, space, time and logic of the imaginary world.

   Problem Sleuth
   has a middling amount of imagination. Although he rarely employs his imagination in altering the imaginary world, he does interact in more subtle ways, such as turning the legs of a monster into mobile legs.
   Ace Dick
   's imagination is pretty terrible. It barely exists. If used, it's more likely to explode in his face than be of use. If it was a face, he'd punch it.

   Using his imagination, Pickle Inspector divided himself into eight parts using
   Combat Operandi
   : Lv. 8
   Pickle Replicsimile
   . One of the Pickle Inspectors then used Combat Operandi:
   Temporal Replicsimile
   to split into two selves, one traveling into the future and becoming
   Future Pickle Inspector
   , the other the past and becoming
   Past Pickle Inspector
   . Later, Future Pickle Inspector used
   Temporal Replicsimile
   again, becoming
   Past-Future Pickle Inspector
   and
   Future-Future Pickle Inspector

   Some items can increase the amount of imagination a character has, most notably
   alcoholic beverages
   . The amount of imagination increased is relative to the current imagination of the character and the strength of the drink. The higher the imagination, the less of an impact the drink. Although hangovers do not lower imagination, they temporarily disable imagination itself until the hangover is cured.

   Normally, characters in the living world who project themselves into the imaginary world are unable to move their physical body, and should reside in the safety of a

    Fort

   . However, those with the Combat Operandi:
   Abstracted
   Thought
   are able to have both imaginary bodies and be consciously separate from them. It is not entirely clear if these separate consciousnesses are divided entirely from their source, or if they still share the same mind (further complicated by time-traveling alter-egos). Due to the portals from the imaginary world to the real world, people with high imagination have the potential to create imaginary inanimate objects and bring them into reality. Imagination is also reflected in the real world by the character's mannerisms. Characters with low imagination may be less humorous or witty, an example of which being Ace Dick eating
   candy corn
   instead of performing
   Candy Corn Vampire
   .
