   The painting,
   and signed by the artist with only a single initial "T," depicts a jet-black horse with a bright orange mane (presumably made of fire) rearing up on its hind legs, poised as if to strike. The horse's opponent is former NFL linebacker
   Bill Romanowski
   , wearing the black and silver uniform of his short stint with the
   Oakland Raiders
   . Romanowski's posture is somewhat ambiguous, but it is assumed that he is charging directly at the horse, preparing to tackle it. Their battle is set atop a field of what appear to be small blue hills, possibly of snow or sand. The sky is painted with the same shade of blue used for the ground, making it difficult to determine where the land ends and the sky begins. Far off in the background, behind Romanowski, a mysterious, craggy purple mountain juts sharply into the air.

   Andrew Hussie, who is particularly fond of "so-bad-it's-good" media and equine themes, praised the painting's flaws in a December 2007 review posted to his blog (now archived in
   that covers his extensive history with the piece). Hussie drew particular attention to the horse's bizarrely humanoid and well-developed biceps and back muscles, compared its blazing mane to the bright and straightened shock of hair one might see on a

   </a>
   , and expressed a sort of delighted confusion at the vague and inexplicable setting of the scene. This post marked the beginning of Hussie's quest to acquire the painting, asking for donations to meet the artist's asking price of $425. The funding campaign was successful, and Hussie received the Painting of a Horse Attacking a Football Player in January 2008.
