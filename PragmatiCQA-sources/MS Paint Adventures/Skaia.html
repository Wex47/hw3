The Battlefield becomes a fully spherical planet upon a third protoyping. After the fourth prototyping, The Battlefield appears to have gained a large outer shell made of checkered tendrils.

   By this means, Skaia forces players to enter the game in the first place, as Skaia eventually fails to protect itself when the largest meteors in the Veil are launched at it, at which point it is destroyed, due to either running out of defense portals or an inability to teleport objects of such size. The players' goal is then to stop the Reckoning before this happens by defeating the Black King, thereby winning the game. The players then disperse their planets' grist hoards into Skaia, preparing it for the

   When the kids orchestrated the scratch, past Skaia manipulated the defense gates so that the meteors bearing the kids and their guardians would land in different places and time periods, so that each kid-guardian pair would be switched (John/Nanna, Rose/Mom, Dave/Bro, Jade/Grandpa). Rose states that Roxy and Dirk living in "the future" instead of the time period Rose and Dave lived in was one of Skaia's "peculiar whims".

  <p key="36feca4f-52f0-49e8-998f-ea6130bcc250">
   Rose also explains the kids' plans to deposit the pre-scratch Battlefield into Skaia, where it would supposedly produce the new universe. This is because the post-scratch session is a void session, wherein there is no pre-entry prototyping destined to happen. Skaia would remain in eternal stalemate, and the Black King would never initiate the Reckoning. Furthermore, the Courtyard Droll blew up the Black and White Kings (or their symbolic representations), making it all the more necessary for another Battlefield to be deposited.

   The trolls' Sburb session was fairly regular, although they faced a 12x prototyped Black King able to release the Vast Glub, making it an unusually difficult final boss.

   Despite being prototyped 12 times, Skaia's battlefield does not seem to differ from the kids', save for the lily-pad like structures. It should be noted that only the first 3 prototypings seemed to affect the battlefield itself in the kid's session, while the 4th added an additional structure surrounding it. However, it is likely that the troll's battlefield is more complex than an initial view suggests - a book in a Prospit library in the Beta Kids' session talks about further non-euclidean modifications based on the addition of additional orbs to the Queen's ring - a notion that the book's author finds ridiculous because it only has 4 orbs.

   It is implied that, upon winning the game, the trolls' Skaia underwent a transformation. From the
   , it seems brighter than usual. It possesses a shimmering surface that resembles a spherical pond more than a sky, and multi colored glowing Lilypads are found on its surface.

   to be floating in the center, which implies that the session's Genesis Frog will be transferred to Skaia for it to grow, with Skaia functioning as its “crib”. It is suggested that pre-entry prototypings are required for Skaia to transform to support something as large and complicated as a universe. A platform bearing the Sgrub symbol has also appeared, to allow the trolls' entry into the universe they created and "rule it as gods".

   to take the path of the conqueror, Skaia becomes darker and heavier, turning into a solid sphere before exploding in an event known as the First Break.
   Fifteen new planets
   emerge from the blast and scatter around the Medium while the remaining Skaian matter collapses into a black hole at the center of the incipisphere. Three of the planets are swallowed by the black hole, leaving only twelve. As part of his quest, Caliborn uses powerful bombs to push each planet into the black hole, "sinking" them.
