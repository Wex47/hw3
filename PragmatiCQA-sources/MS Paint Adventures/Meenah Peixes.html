       No punctuation, uses all caps for emphasis, but text is otherwise uncapitalized. Uses )( and -E for capital H and E. Fish puns even more compulsively than Feferi. Slight elements of Eridan's accent (-in, gonna, etc). Replaces the eyes in emoticons with 8 for goggles and includes a 3 before to represent a tiara, like Feferi (e.g. 38D).

  </h2>
  <p key="9628a55d-3003-4a76-87a8-a408b74c08d8">
   When the suggestion box for Feferi's name was open, "Meenah" was one of the suggested names,
   . The name is derived from the Sanskrit name for the zodiac sign Pisces, Mīna.
  </p>
  <p key="79f47a04-3954-4669-98e0-5fb8eb185250">
   The name may come from the
   Meena
   caste of India (a reference to the
   <a href="Hemospectrum.html" key="2f702bdf-327e-4406-b077-7f1f482b42cc" title="Hemospectrum">
    hemospectrum
   </a>
   ), who claim to be descended from
   Matsya
   , the fish avatar of Vishnu. The name of the caste is derived from Sanskrit for "fish" (
   <i key="6705b402-e2b5-4e63-a932-4ca4e863b4b3">
    "meen"
   </i>
   ), with which the name for the zodiac sign Pisces, Mīna, is cognate. The name also bears a striking similarity to the Arabic word Mina, which means "seaport", referencing her astrological symbol. Her name may be a reference to an Near Eastern unit of currency, the Mina. This goes along with her love of money/gold. This unit is key to the pun in "
   the writing on the wall
   ".
  </p>
  <p key="1cd3a52a-d9c3-4b3c-8284-ba813214cd99">
   It is also possible that the name comes from a variation of the Indian god Parvati, in the form of Meenakshi, the fish-eyed goddess, who was also set to be the divine ruler of the city of Madurai, going along with Meenah's royal status.

   After the game began, Meenah became a constant source of trouble for her team and frequently attempted to engineer feuds and rivalries between her friends. She did so because she believed that her team would be more likely to win if they were more aggressive. Her efforts were largely ineffective and actually backfired when her constant bullying caused

   During the final hours of her session when it became apparent the session was unwinnable and Aranea came up with the plan to

   informed her that if the trolls were dead when the scratch completed they would continue to exist as ghosts, instead of being condemned to non-existence. After the scratch was activated she killed herself and all of her friends by exploding a bomb before the scratch completed. It was timed so that the scratch would take effect before the god tier players came back to life.

  <p key="f10cbc5e-748a-48a4-98f8-bf728dfb173d">
   Meenah's short explanation enrages Aranea, who proceeds to tell the story of the post-scratch ancestors Meenah-style, summing up each post-scratch troll's adventures, with the exception of Meenah. Meenah, who had been enjoying the story thus far, asks Aranea to tell her story, not as short of the others, but not as long as she usually does. She appears to be so excited over the fact that her post-scratch self became an insanely wealthy galaxy-owning dictator that the dazed smile retains on her face even as Jake, having mistaken her for simply a past Condesce, beats the shit out of her.

She and Vriska then discuss how they're going to put forth their plan without Aranea, and Vriska reveals that Aranea was controlling most of the ghosts, and without the army they don't see how it'll be possible.

   (for the hell of it). She also comes across as very rude and quite sarcastic at times, possibly making her one of the meanest out of the adolescent trolls. She seems to be a little sneaky and sly as well. However, she does also volunteer some information to John, such as her intention to kill Dream Roxy for no apparent reason. When questioned about Karkat and Vriska she claims to have no knowledge of them, making it likely that she has not heard of the other trolls from Hivebent, due having only just died from her perspective.

   Despite being prone to rude and sarcastic remarks, too impatient to listen to excessive speeches from Aranea and
   Kankri

   Mituna
   , even though from past experience she knows he's rude and insufferable, rescues Karkat from Kankri and even strikes up a friendship with him, and openly compliments Terezi's dragon costume even without apparently having met her before. Meenah admits to having attempted to kill
   Meulin
   several times during their session (though the latter hadn't noticed), but says that's all in the past, and aside from a certain displeasure at Meulin's loud and excitable nature she does otherwise carry on a friendly conversation.
