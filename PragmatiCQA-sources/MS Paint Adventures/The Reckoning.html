   Skaia

   occupying a separate location in space time Skaia can send the meteors to various points in time of the host planet's history. Most of them arrive at the same time, namely during the time the players start their Sburb session, motivating them to enter the Medium in the first place, which creates a circular paradox.

   eventually captures the
   White King
   's scepter and uses it to initiate the Reckoning. After this point, the meteors are sent towards Skaia, starting with the smallest and gradually sending larger ones. The players have twenty-four hours to defeat the Black King and end the Reckoning before the largest meteors destroy Skaia and render their session unwinnable.

   The pre-scratch kids' session of Sburb, however, had the Reckoning occur much earlier than it is supposed to in an average session, on account of

   There is no Reckoning in the post-scratch kids' universe. This is due to the lack of any prototyping, meaning that the Battlefield remains forever in its initial stalemated state.

   The Reckoning is an important part of the story of the
   paradox clones
   . At some point after being "born", each paradox clone is transported onto one of the meteors in the veil, and with it, through Skaia's defense gates, to the player's home planet, into the past, thus
   creating them in the first place
   .

  <p key="957222e0-69ee-4383-a8c2-c0e99582c4ff">
   After the scratch is activated, the meteors carrying the paradox clones are sent to an alternate version of their home planet. Other meteors don't get this treatment.
