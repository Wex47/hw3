   He is wrapped in yellow caution tape instead of the typical dirty rags worn by an exile. His name might be a reference to 'rebel without a cause'. His use of long-range munitions may well be a joke, as he is "Aimless" yet describes his skill at marksmanship as "striking."

   All exiles each have multiple titles composed of two words. The first and second words of each title start with the same letter. Commands for an exile's past self begin with a question mark (?). The Aimless Renegade is also known as the Authority Regulator and the Armaments Regent.

   and were painstakingly excavated from beneath the sand. The full extent of his armory is unclear at this point, but he has been shown to have a pair of pistols and a rocket launcher in addition to his AK and most likely carries a quite formidable assortment of weapons from the personal collection of Jade's grandfather. Given that centuries have passed, however, it is unknown how many of these guns continue to function.

   Initially, he is quite aggressive towards WV and PM, although this seems to stem from simple territorial enforcement rather than familiarity and hatred. He briefly considers letting them slide, but finds he is unable to ignore their flagrant trespassing. He seems to be rather single-minded regarding his laws and the enforcement thereof, replying that he "[doesn't] give a shit" about the common mistake of whether his gun is magazine-fed or clip-fed (though this is more likely Andrew telling the people correcting him about semantics that it's largely irrelevant to the story anyway) and seeking to destroy WV and PM for violating his "crime scene." He repeatedly fails to hit his intended target, including one occasion where he seems to be

   , he was preparing to blow up the pods which was part of the Exiles' plan to prevent Jack finding them. However Jack appeared from the Lotus Flower in the frog ruins, shortly after the White King came out of the same Lotus Flower. Jack killed the White King and the White Queen upon confrontation. Outside the temple Jack targets PM, and AR begins to blow up the bases prematurely to prevent Jack using them, this diverts Jack's attention to AR. AR manages to blow up all the pods, except for one- WV's pod, hesitating since WV was trapped in the pod. In his hesitation, Jack decapitates him.

   Much like how the Vagabond wants to be a Mayor and the Mendicant wants to be a Postwoman, the Renegade seems to idolize Judges and the law in general. This is evidenced by the caution tape he wears and his obsession with the "illegal pictography" and "illicit amphibian idolatry" that the Temple represents. He also wears a powdered wig fashioned out of ammunition belts and holds a mock court with himself in the judge's seat. He will do whatever is necessary to remedy these crimes and keep others from interfering with his jurisdiction and appears to prefer to go about these tasks via violent methods. It is also notably ironic that although being labeled as a renegade, he has a strict sense of lawfulness. Just as Wayward Vagabond only eats vegetables, it seems he only ever consumes meat products and may be carnivorous in nature. The Renegade has been shown to be completely selfless, as he sacrificed his only escape route to save a
