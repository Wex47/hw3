   Diemen is the name of a town in the province of North Holland, Netherlands, which comes from the river Diem (itself originating from di eme, meaning "the water"). Alternatively, it may come from the German die men ("the men"), or its agricultural definition of "a layered pile of hay, peat, or straw in the open field". Xicali may originate from Mexicali, the capital city of Baja California. Additionally, Xicali in chinese means "scrubbing force", possibly alluding to a birth assignment typical of a rustblood.
  </p>
  <p key="7cac11f5-bff9-42ed-a1b3-c69b9f8231fa">
   Diemen's leaked placeholder name,
   , comes from his original design having a wiener dog lusus,
   . It fits his current love of hot dogs as well.

His lusus was killed, and Diemen was forced to take to the streets, obtaining food by "talking people" into giving him oblong meat products.

Diemen is so shocked that he stumbles backwards, pulling the player with him, and after rolling down a hill, Diemen hits his head on a concrete curb, after which MSPA Reader lands on him ass first, leading to the outcome of Diemen being killed, and MSPA Reader accidentally and unwillingly earning the high ranking title of deadliest ass on Alternia .

Diemen is distraught, but in their attempts to comfort him the player offers to help him obtain a new one, claiming, falsely, that they know where a large number of oblong meat products can be obtained. Spurred on by this, Diemen follows the player on a circuitous, random route through Outglut, that eventually leads them into the sewers. After more aimless wandering, Diemen feels that he is too tired to go on, and despairs at his inability to obtain more meat products. However, he feels gratitude to the player for attempting to help him. The two then feel the rumbling of a drone patrolling the sewers, and hurry to escape. Diemen falls in the sewage, only to be rescued by the player and pulled up a ladder to the surface. The two realize that they have emerged into a meat storage freezer, filled with oblong meat products. Diemen is overjoyed, and he and the player become certified friends in this "meat heaven!!!" good ending to Diemen's route.

   . Diemen was subsequently made homeless, and forced to live on the streets scrounging for food; particularly, Oblong Meat Products, a Troll hotdog analog.
Despite being forced to live on the streets, he retains a relatively optimistic view on life and does what he can to get by. He mentions that he's gotten quite proficient at talking people into giving him meat products, but is still quite wary of people trying to steal his food right under his nose—it's happened several times in the past, since trolls think Diemen's status as a burgundy makes him an easy mark. Yet, he later laments that he's not particularly good at anything, and some of his attempts to get more food ends up ruining his friendships.
While friendly and open to chat with others, Diemen prefers taking things slow when making new friends as he wants to assess whether the person in question is indeed friendship material. His cautiousness can be attributed to the fact that he's worried people are only trying to get close to him so they can get his oblong meat product.
Diemen's trust can be earned by being a good and understanding listener, as well as being genuinely helpful and kind to him. By then, he's more likely to speak candidly about his life, and even offer the player his shirt to use as a sling for their broken arm. It should be noted that he seems to get really attached to the player in a short amount of time; in his good ending, he stares at the player a little

   intensely after the player saved his life, while his second bad ending has him blatantly making flushed advances on the player.
When Diemen loses his hot dog to the player's clumsiness, he is visibly distraught and upset. But the instant the player offers to get him another one, Diemen is willing to put his grievances aside and follow the player in their search for food. Once fixated on the goal of obtaining another meat product, Diemen becomes surprisingly gullible and goes along with whatever the player says.
He misses his lusus quite a lot, and would openly weep when reminiscing the activities and food they'd bonded over. However, he understands that dwelling too much on the past wouldn't really help, and instead focuses on the few benefits of living off the grid. Diemen believes that if he can survive on his own out in the open, his lusus would be immensely proud of him, since life on Alternia as a lowblood is no easy feat.

   Diemen shows up as a cameo in
   Hiveswap: Act 2
   . He is on the rustblood car in the train and can be talked to, although he will accuse Joey of trying to steal his hot dog in the middle of their conversation and won't say anything else after.

   Diemen's Troll Call reveal card described him as "All About That Oblong Meat Product", although notes that he is uncertain about its precise contents. Diemen is rarely pictured without his signature hotdog, of which he is very protective, and much of his dialogue concerns it.
