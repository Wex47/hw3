   , Jade still avoids him, leery of any "confrontation", as though his being dead has not stopped him from lecturing her whenever she approaches his stuffed remains. She apparently finds these confrontations to be "intense" as her grandpa is very strict and charismatic. He's prone to giving
   stern lectures
   to Jade whenever they meet and insists Jade carry a

   when she leaves the house, or else "there would be hell to pay." According to Jade, he was much easier to deal with when he was alive. Even the battle engine seemed confused, deeming their combat "STRIFE?". Jake Harley seems to suggest that Jade take a bigger and more effective gun before she goes outside to defend herself.

   He decorated his house with multiple motifs, including suits of armor (including some more modern armors such those of
   Iron Man
   and
   the Judge
   ), decrepit mummies, big game trophies, sunbleached photos of women (his "beauties"), and globes. Though Jade doesn't mind the suits of armor, she hates the mummies and hunting trophies. Some of the big game trophies in Jake's tower appear to be chimeras, or combinations of different animals. Whether these are genetic experiments, mythical creatures, or terrible abuses of taxidermy is unknown. Notably, some of his trophies are the mounted heads of

   According to Jade, Grandpa is an extreme polymath; he's a world-renowned explorer, naturalist, treasure hunter, archaeologist, scientist, adventurer, big game hunter, and billionaire. This would explain the close proximity of ancient ruins to his house and having a laboratory. His renaissance man aspect may be the main contributor to the fact that both Jade and

   He was then stuffed and set up infront of the fireplace, just like
   Poppop
   . He was originally a prime candidate for Jade's
   Kernelsprite
   , but John advised Jade against it before entering, as prototyping him would lead to a lot of the enemies having Grandpa's face. They were planning to prototype him after entering, but Bec warped Grandpa's body (along with the rest of the room's contents) into outer space so that he could prototype the Kernelsprite with himself. Jake's body remained in outer space until the universe was destroyed by Jack Noir.

   In the post-scratch version of the kids' universe, it is later revealed that the Frog Temple had two hidden transportalizers. These lead to Prospit and Derse, based on their colorations. This would explain Grandpa's accessibility to the Medium, a secret long kept throughout the story, should these transportalizers exist in all instances of the temple itself. They would not account for the apparent time travel involved in the situation. It can, however, be assumed that Grandpa may simply have used the
   Lotus Time Capsule

   As a guardian, most of Jake Harley's traits can only be inferred from second-hand information and interaction with other characters. Jake is a world famous adventurer, billionaire and philanthropist. His interests for the most part match up with his
   post-scratch self
   , including an eclectic list of pastimes including adventuring, travelling, ancient artifacts, guns, women with an affection of the color blue, and taxidermy, interests that he would mostly pass on to his granddaughter before his passing. Similar to Jade, he appears to have a strong grasp on various sciences, particularly in areas of physics, energy generation and various SBURB-related fringe-sciences.
  </p>
  <p key="3250af4a-6d88-4a03-b9cc-d90dc623e162">
   During his youth, he acted especially similarly to Jake English, but appeared to also share his adoptive sister's interests in mysteries and practical jokes before those interests shifted towards adventure. He had a huge affection towards dogs, and took on the name of his grandfather's dog, Halley (albeit, slightly corrupted into Harley, due to his apparent speech impediment).
  </p>
  <p key="ae806975-ddf0-4bfc-bccd-6990a6cf8e2c">
   Jake Harley is notably a strange and private man, and shows signs of being a generally awful parental figure. This is indicated by his neglect of his children, Joey Claire and Jude Harley, and to a lesser extent, Jade, who he allowed to play with pistols as a toddler. While not a villain, he may share his post-scratch self's general lack of self-awareness and issues with maintaining relationships.

Before leaving, he reassures her that he believes in her. Jake and his sister would never see each other again in person in either of their natural (or extended) lifetimes.
