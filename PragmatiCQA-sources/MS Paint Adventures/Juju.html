   believe they simply appear spontaneously out of nothing. Each juju exists as a single entity across all realities and cannot be copied or permanently destroyed. Should there ever appear to be two copies of one juju, one of the "copies" is either an illusion or an error that will eventually be erased from existence, or more commonly, is destined to end up becoming the other version at some later time.

   These traits are similar to the traits of objects in a
   bootstrap paradox
   , where an object travels through time from the future, to the past, thereby creating itself in an eternal cycle. Because the item is always becoming itself, it has no true or "traceable origin". This would also explain why a juju cannot be destroyed, because destroying it at any point in time would result in the juju not being able to exist in the first place so that it could be destroyed, creating a
   grandfather paradox
   , an unstable loop that would result in a doomed timeline. But the abilities of juju breakers also disputes this

   Lil Cal is the most prominent juju in the comic, a seemingly innocuous if slightly unnerving puppet that in truth is a cursed vessel of misfortune. It has been stated to exist solely to ruin the lives of those within the universe containing it. As an element of his curse and perhaps its origin, Cal's essence is entangled with Caliborn's; his eyes serving as "the most beautiful windows into [Caliborn's] hideous soul." Lil Cal's origins are paradoxical and occur across multiple universes, making him one of the more temporally convoluted jujus. Caliborn previously feared the curse Cal contained, but became relieved and excited when, in his communion with Cal, he realized that the curse would be brought about by himself. Originally believing there to exist two separate instances of Cal within the same universe, one on Earth, one in Dirk's Dersite room, Caliborn had demanded that

These two traits have been burned into his subconscious by Gamzee, which lead to the creation of a "dream self" for Cal that paradoxically became the very puppet owned by his Bro that haunted Dave's waking self and then in turn branched off into all other instances of Cal from there.

   Calliope
   and Caliborn each have their own juju: a giant color-coded sucker, each in a color matching its owner's blood. When in close proximity, the suckers gain a magnet-like attraction and fuse together into one green-and-red spiral sucker. Anyone holding the fused juju gains the irresistible urge to lick it; doing so engages

   While Calliope claimed that her juju would be useless without her brother's, Caliborn said that they each did something on their own and that they probably did the exact opposite of each other. Calliope kept her juju in a juju chest, and it is apparently an heirloom passed down to her by her ancestors. The same is probably true of Caliborn's juju.

   The suckers enchanted the shackles keeping their shared body chained to the wall, preventing them from leaving the meteor until Caliborn took full control of the body and freed himself from Calliope's chain by gnawing off his leg. The two cherubs gave the captcha codes for their jujus to two of the B2 kids as gifts: Calliope gave hers to
   Jane
   and Caliborn gave his to
   Jake
   . Jake later attempted to give the second code to Jane but could not remember it; Jane was, however, easily able to deduce it. After the suckers are alchemized, they fuse and Jane engages Trickster Mode by licking it.

   The Captchalogue code for the suckers is derived from
   Ouroboros
   , differentiated into two codes by their owners' respective typing quirks: "UrobUros" for Calliope's and "uROBuROS" for Caliborn's. Applying punch-card alchemy logic, ANDing (&amp;&amp;) the two codes gives "OHG1OHGK", and ORing (||) the two codes produces the code "?!wl?!w?". It is yet to be seen what objects this would create.

   As the suckers fuse together, a variant on an ouroboros, consisting of an intertwined black and white snake biting each other's tails, becomes briefly superimposed over the combined juju. This variant is identical to

   Vriska has since found the treasure, and John tried to touch it, even though she warned him against it. Post-transformation, it appears to act as a gateway to multiple points in time and space, and consequently makes any object that passes through appear at a myriad of places, both spatially and in respect to timeline. It is unknown if this effect is totally randomised, or if the points an object that passes through appears in have a pattern to them. Shortly after passing through it a second time, John's dream hologram started blurring out and he vanished, his physical body shortly following suit.

The crowbar, while not explicitly stated, might be a reference to the Half-Life series, in which Gordon Freeman, the game's protagonist, has a crowbar as his trademark weapon. He also loses his crowbar and will either get it back or replace it with a new one, similar to how jujus can't be destroyed or always return to the owner.

He says there's a probability that it simply tells the result instead of influencing it, just like how regular clocks do with time. He also says there's a possibility that it does influence the result, but adds that there is a hole in that theory given that Slick broke it. A further complication is the question of whether Slick's opinion would have lent any weight to the outcome as, since he was exiled by Vriska, he would consider her death Just.

Access to it served as the primary goal of the Midnight Crew during the events of the intermission, and was gained by the use of

   A pair of mysterious rings that provide powerful aspect-related abilities. The Ring of Life can be used to resurrect spirits in the Furthest Ring, and the Ring of Void provides complete invisibility and intangibility to the wearer. They are said to be correspondent with one another, one being lost whenever its counterpart is found. The Ring of Life was most recently used by

   ripped it off her finger and snapped her neck. It is currently unknown whether someone who has worn the ring will stay alive after wearing it, as Aranea was killed immediately after the Condesce took it (however, as Aranea's eyes seem to turn a ghostly white before she falls into the fire, it is possible that having the ring removed does remove their living properties. The condence snapping Aranea's neck would not have caused her eyes to turn white, it would have just killed her). It is now in the possession of Roxy Lalonde after "retcon shenanigans" by John Egbert, who has passed it to Calliope, rendering her alive again.
