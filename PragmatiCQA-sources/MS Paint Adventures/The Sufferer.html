   The rage that overcame the Signless at his execution seems to continue on in his descendant, with the truth
   perhaps also being encoded somewhere within Karkat. One of the Signless' teachings was that
   , obviously referring to
   the Reckoning
   that would come with Karkat playing the game
   Sgrub
   , and echoing real-life mythology surrounding the
   Second Coming
   of Jesus Christ, whose story the Signless' life parallels. It is thanks to this prophecy that Karkat has a lusus, with the crab lusus presumably having been bred in secret by the Signless' followers who believed in this prophecy.

  <p key="01e3509d-fb74-4857-825e-bf027604882c">
   The Signless' hope of uniting all of Alternia's blood castes was in a sense realised by Karkat's leadership of a team of
   heroes
   from across the hemospectrum.
