   Sprites are meant to serve as a player's guide, but they also have functions important to a session. Despite serving as a guide, sprites cannot accompany their players through
   The Seven Gates
   until they have unlocked the ability to do so at which point the sprite gives the player a
   pendant
   which they can use to summon the sprite. Until that point, a Sprite can still communicate with their player using a Spritelog, which can work at a distance - at least allowing Nannasprite to communicate with John as he was down on his planet past the first gate, and she was still in the house.

   Combining the kernelsprite with inanimate objects, living or formerly living beings is a process known as prototyping, the objects or beings become the sprite. The sprite or the individual(s) prototyped are given access to a wealth of knowledge about Sburb and their corresponding player's personal quest, with the ability to convey the information limited by intelligence of the sprite which is limited to that of its composing parts, as seen with

   players face and the Royals of the light and dark kingdoms. Because the sprite only splits upon entering the Medium and never again, only the prototyping done before entering the Medium will affect the Underlings and Royals. (For example; John prototyped his sprite with a harlequin doll before entering the Medium, and with his grandma's ashes after entering the Medium, but the Royals and Underlings only were affected by the harlequin prototyping.) A sprite entering the Medium also causes the
   the Battlefield
   to grow, with each entry of a prototyped sprite causing it to grow further. The final form of the Battlefield can only be reached by all players prototyping at least once before entry, as the final form of the Battlefield is required in order to grow the
   Genesis Frog
   and thus win the game.

   A session with no pre-entry prototyping is called a
   void session
   . A lack of spires on a session's Prospit and Derse (as well as orbs on the Queens' rings and Kings' scepters) are indicative of a Void session. In such cases the Kernelsprite is unaffected by entry and instead the kernel disappears upon prototyping.

  <p key="2ea455cd-dc07-41e3-81c1-c5427dcb6db1">
   Prototyping is where an object, or living or dead organism is combined with the sprite. Each individual sprite can be prototyped twice, although they only need to be prototyped once prior to entry to make a session viable, and the second prototyping can still be undertaken post-entry, however with the kernel gone the information will not be dispersed. In order to be prototyped a sprite needs to have direct contact with an object or organism. Jasprose mentions that brief or incidental contact may not result in a prototyping
   .
  </p>
  <p key="feb8a320-ae2e-4ebe-850e-9d0d547a1f3d">
   Kernelsprites that have not been prototyped pre-entry are
   remain in their
   Second tier prototyping mostly works the same as first tier, except that extremities of the sprite such as a
   or
   will not lead to prototyping - touching the core of the sprite, or full-body contact, appears to be necessary. However, this might be a special circumstance applying to sprites and non-sprite beings, since Nepetasprite was prototyped with Davesprite when they shook hands, and Jasprose seemingly knew that this would happen
   . Alternatively two sprites would be more reactive with each other than a sprite and a living person, as it has been previously stated that Kernels and Sprites have an affinity to be prototyped with the dead.
  </p>
  <p key="66c808cd-0379-4354-99c7-93eba997cb33">
   While inanimate objects appear to act as templates for the sprite affecting its behavior and personality, living or deceased beings do not merely act as a template for the sprite to imitate, but rather literally become the sprite with the deceased being resurrected, including bringing the soul back from the afterlife. The Kernelsprite also has an innate attraction to the dead or soon-to-be-deceased, with almost all Kernelsprite across all sessions ever played being prototyped with such individuals.
  </p>
  <p key="fe302480-e489-4125-a4b3-0a7493e5d4c6">
   While the physical traits and associated abilities of prototypings are cumulative upon a sprite, the mental identities of the prototyped components are not. When people have been prototyped with animals or objects, or animals prototyped with objects, they keep their identity, with the other prototyping only influencing their instincts and some behavior. However in the case of two components of an equal "level" the two different identities are merged, as seen with the trollsprites.
  </p>
  <p key="05fd7aa1-f051-4354-b194-b98d1916190c">
   What constitutes a single component is complex, as two things combined into one can count as a single prototyping, while a single component that is existing in multiple pieces can count as a single prototyping. Prototyping two separate components simultaneously also appears to use up both prototypings.

   Sprites with unstable components or conflicting prototyping are liable to self-destruct.
   Tavrisprite
   "tavrispl♉ded" themself only minutes after being created due to the irreconcilable personalities it possessed. Jadesprite, while she did not self-destruct, released a burst of energy similar to Tavrisprite soon after being created due to being upset over being revived, this was exacerbated by her other prototyping causing her to see the
   Green Sun
   . It is unknown if this was her simply losing control of her first guardian powers or a failed attempt at self-destruction, as first guardians are nearly indestructible it could possibly have prevented her self-destruction. Even though the combination of

   While sprites are supposed to act as a guide to the player, a player is also capable of prototyping themselves and becoming their own sprite. This can be used to circumnavigate the normal process by which information is revealed, as well as giving the player a power boost but at the expense of having no one to assist the player for parts of the session.

   A tier 1 sprite can be prototyped with another sprite. This process allows a sprite to be prototyped with more than two non-sprite objects. This new type of sprite is referred to as a sprite^2, or "squaredsprite". The unique prototyping results in many peculiar changes to the sprite, including the discarding of the usual "sprite tail" in favor of actual legs. The sprite also flashes constantly between the two original sprites' color schemes.

   All squaredsprites gain partial access to the memories of all alternate versions of the entities that make up the sprite. The specific physical iterations that were prototyped to result in a squaredsprite stick out as the "main" ones, but memories of other iterations' experiences are accessible. For example

   However, all squaredsprites seen have involved sprites from two different sessions - it might be the case that the access to alternate memories requires sprites from multiple sessions, not just any two sprites. It should also be noted that Rose and Davesprite both already had some memories from a doomed timeline - this may also have contributed to this ability.

   The session being

   trolls
   each. Only the prototyping of one of these sprites was seen, during which he prototyped both trolls simultaneously; as such, it is likely he prototyped the other two in the same manner. Dirk's sprite was only prototyped with one troll by
   Gamzee
   . It was subsequently prototyped again by Dirk, thus making it the only sprite of the session pre-retcon confirmed not to have its prototypings occur simultaneously and the only sprite to have a non-troll component.

However, Jaspersprite prototyped Pre-retcon Rose into Roxy's sprite after Roxy's funeral for Rose, unbeknownst to Roxy, and Jasprosesprite^2 prototyped Jake's sprite with

   In the only seen dead session, prior to entry there were signs the session had potential to be a multi-player session. If it is the case that would likely mean all dead sessions require a single player to reject the other player(s) and play by themselves. It was speculated that as the other player(s) are prevented from playing that their sprites and the player's sprite are all released at once. This could potentially cause them to prototype each other and collapse into the black hole, thus allowing entry into the dead session. However Andrew
   that it was a single kernel that collapsed.
