       Normal pUnctUation. British spelling. Only capitalizes U. But occasionally capitalizes full words when flustered, as shown
       Uses emoticons incorporating the letter u such as ^u^, u_u, and :U. Will occasionally incorporate tildes (~) into emoticons such as ~_u and :u~. Encases actions in angle brackets, such as &lt;kisses!&gt;. Encases words in asterisks (*) for *emphasis*. Sometimes multiplies letters or punctuation by 11.

   The name comes from the Greek muse of epic poetry, which gives them the title
   <a href="Mythological roles.html" key="7e644ddc-9cd1-4c1e-aa2c-10a3fa36e2d3" title="Mythological roles">
    Muse of Space

   . The muse also gave her name to a musical instrument similar to an organ, often played at
   circuses
   . Furthering the theme of muses,
   Urania
   was the Greek muse of astronomy, while
   Uranus
   was the primal Greek god personifying the sky; thus,
   William Herschel
   named the planet that he and his sister discovered after Uranus.

   It is also a reference to the novel
   Middlesex

   Kalliope (the goddess)'s symbol was a writing tablet, like Calliope's most treasured thing is her drawing tablet. It reflects them being a characterization of the Homestuck fandom too, as Homestuck is quite the epic story and tends to use poetry now and then.

   ". Umbra is Latin for "shadow" (whence we get 'umbrage', meaning anger); in English, it can mean the same, but usually refers specifically to the darkest part of a shadow. 'UU' also completes the DNA motif of all the other chumhandles/trolltags, representing uracil.

   The word "
   uranian
   " is a 19th-century term referring to a "female psyche in a male body". Though Calliope is not technically in a male body, the body, later on, belongs to her counterpart, Caliborn. Uranus is also commonly associated with the Sailor Moon character of
   Tenō Haruka
   , an androgynous lesbian character who is often interpreted as being intersex and/or nonbinary due to being referred to as "both a man and a woman. A soldier of both genders, with strengths and personalities of each.”

   In North America, the caduceus and Asklepios are often confused for one another, where the former is used to symbolize the medical profession, while it is used to represent commerce elsewhere. While Calliope uses this symbol, Caliborn uses the Japanese-preferred symbol for Ophiuchus which is a tilde superimposed over the letter U, a stylized symbol of a man holding a snake. The tilde also resembles Calliope's fake horns, each of which in turn resembles one of the entwined snakes. Her sign may also be two adult cherubs mating, as adult cherubs turn into serpents while mating. Even further, her symbol could be interpreted simply as a caduceus without the wings, similar to how Caliborn predominated before their body could develop wings.

   he revealed that he had their session's Jack Noir kill Calliope before the said game (at least from his temporal perspective). It is also mentioned that Caliborn would like to get his hands on Calliope's Juju (just as she would like to do with his,
   ).

   Calliope seems very friendly and cordial toward Jane and Jake, offering constructive advice about the alpha kids' session. However, due to the rules of her and Caliborn's game, she tends to be extraordinarily cagey when referring to personal details about herself. She is like this with Dirk and Roxy, but not shown to as much of an extent.

   She seems very fond of Roxy and even confides in her during the final moments of her visibility into Roxy's session. Calliope reveals to Roxy her name, title, and race, and even gives her some fan art of a

   Roxy. She admits to Roxy how beautiful she finds both the human and troll races, and how insecure she is about her own appearance, even going so far as to say that no one would even kiss her as a means of revival as a result. She seems taken aback by the notion of a flushed relationship, due to her race's standpoint on the matter, but does not seem to object much to pale relationships.

   that seems to reference events involving Calliope and Caliborn and stars a character named Calmasis, who seems to be representative of them both. This would tie in well with Calmasis' androgynous nature. The cover of the book also features Calliope's associated symbol and Calliope's outfit is nearly identical to Calmasis', with the dark green suit and red bow tie. Calliope also wears a wig that matches Calmasis' snow-white hair, furthering the link between them. As Calmasis seemingly represents both Calliope and Caliborn, it is unclear which one is the antihero and which the antagonist.

   Calliope and Caliborn are seen playing a game of chess. Caliborn had created tiny caps for his king and queen in order to hide one as the other after convincing Calliope to let him swap his king and queen's starting positions, and thus fool her into believing he had swapped them while actually leaving them in their normal starting position. In the book, Calmasis engages Zazzerpan in a game of chess, which closely parallels the game of chess between Calliope and Caliborn. However, during their chess game, it was, in fact, Caliborn who plays the role of Calmasis, and Calliope who emulated Zazzerpan.
