   Aradia lost most of her interest in ordinary activities after her death, and appears to be constantly bored. Breaking things is the only way she is comfortable in showing her emotions. She refuses to allow herself to acknowledge that she has emotions because it makes her feel safe to feel nothing. She also seems to blame herself for her death before she entered the Soulbot, saying that the circumstances that led to her death involved
   on her part.
  </p>
  <p key="11aed9ce-1b44-4620-a68a-af06795de42e">
   Before her death, she seems to have been happier and more enthusiastic,
   while playing Flarp. It also appears that she enjoyed the movies of Troll Indiana Jones, which likely influenced her decision to be an archaeologist and use the whipkind strife specibus. Post death, she has since stopped caring about both archaeology and role playing, along with essentially all of her former interests.

  <p key="e771379f-6c0c-4d0b-aff8-5183f67e9c70">

   for what appeared to be revenge, but might have been to ensure Vriska's ascension to
   god tier
   . After getting used to the body she still appears to be fatalistic and jaded, but now a lot more violent and confrontational, though she does acknowledge certain trolls (such as
   Karkat Vantas
   ) as friends. This change is probably brought on by the violent tendencies from the blue blood in the soulbot. Karkat has called her a

   This is more or less true once Aradia achieves god tier and is, officially, very much alive and intends to stay that way. She is enthusiastic and kind even when talking about depressing things. She is convinced that there is no reason to grieve, and thinks that things are going to turn out okay. Considering her knowledge of the time stream, it is likely that she knows some hopeful things later in the timeline, as she knew Sollux would see her again, but he would be blind. Aradia has abandoned her typing quirk now, even though she used it prior to her death. This change might be related to her claim that she feels
