   The Team Charge Debacle is a series of events, originally thought of as a singular accidental event, that occurred due to the Team Charge v. Team Scourge session of Flarp. It started with Vriska crippling Tavros, and continued through a vicious cycle of revenge.

   During one FLARP session, Vriska, Tavros' clouder, set up an extremely difficult session for him, trapping him between a cliff and some unreasonably overpowered enemies. Realizing that there was no possible way to win, he tried asking Aradia and Terezi for help. Neither responded, as they were distracted by

  <p key="8e477401-a402-449d-9f7c-ae71859ca97d">
   As an act of protest, Aradia and Terezi severed ties with Vriska. Aradia was racked with guilt over her inability to help Tavros. Terezi advised her to not take action, and volunteered to handle it herself. Despite Terezi's warnings, Aradia decided to take revenge, with the encouragement of the voices of the dead. She summoned the ghosts of Vriska's previous victims, and unleashed them on her.

   into consuming mind honey and killing Aradia with his psionics, an act made particularly cruel by the implication of a romantic relationship between the two. In response to this, Terezi tricked Vriska by contacting her and forewarning her of her plan to exact revenge, suggesting that Vriska consult her
   magic cue ball
   to confirm the seriousness of Terezi's threat. Immediately afterwards, with Sollux's help, she contacted

   and told him that Vriska was using one of his valued objects, (the magic cue ball), to cheat in the game that they were playing together. In anger, he blew up the Cue Ball in Vriska's face, causing her to lose her arm and her vision eightfold.

   Vriska retaliated immediately by using her mind powers in a Psychic Double Reach-Around. She began by gaining mind control over Tavros, and used his powers of psychic animal communion to control Terezi's
   Lusus
   , which guided her while she slept. She then used the lusus' influence over Terezi to persuade her to walk into the middle of the forest during a bright Alternian day and open her eyes and stare into the blistering Alternian sun, blinding her. This event also caused Terezi's
   dream self
   to wake up on Prospit and stare into Skaia, blinding her as well. This was likely inspired by Mindfang's idea of

   After this final exchange, Vriska and Terezi eventually established a truce, ceasing this cycle of revenge. In a later
   with Terezi,
   Karkat
   mentions that Vriska had been nowhere near her at the time—since Vriska cannot control Terezi, he is baffled as to how she managed to blind her.

   Eventually, once the trolls have entered the Medium, Aradia receives her Soulbot from
   Equius
   , and regains a physical form and stronger emotions. She travels to the Land of Maps and Treasure to confront Vriska. Thanks to her new robotic strength, she beats her to near death and leaves her to bleed out with Tavros nearby. Unconscious, Vriska wakes up on Prospit, only to be greeted by Terezi, who completes the karmic cycle with a slap to her face. Directly after, her dream self manipulates Tavros, but only into writing himself messages in her blood (she does not take full control of his mind). She tells him to take her to her quest cocoon and kill her quickly, which he fails to have the cojones to do. She dies slowly within the cocoon and ascends to
