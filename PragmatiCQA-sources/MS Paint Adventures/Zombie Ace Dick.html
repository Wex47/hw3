   Problem Sleuth
   when Problem Sleuth frees him from his confinement of rope from some unscrupulous
   whores

   Ace Dick's attacks revolve around using his stout weight and his hearty Vim gauge. The most common, albeit the most absurd, is the Truffle Shuffle, where he lifts up his shirt and dances back and forth to defeat his enemies. Individually this attack has little use (and in fact gets Ace Dick killed in one scenario), but the more Ace Dicks that come into play, the more damage this attack deals. Ace Dick also has several moves that involve using his mouth.

   AD is a tough customer that prefers violence rather than diplomacy, and solves many of his problems through the usual method of beating something to death, preferably with whatever is lying around, including fictional items used to express a stat, such as the
   Etiquette Monstrance
   . As a high
   Vim
   character, Ace Dick uses his great strength to solve problems. For example, he can wield many
   weapons
   that others cannot, such as the
   Machine Gun/Hairpin
   . One of his greatest weaknesses is that Ace has possibly the lowest
   Imagination
   stat in the universe, which tends to give him trouble in situations that require creativity.

   Ace Dick's pathetic
   Imagination
   means that he is almost unable to
   fantasize
   anything interesting. So when he completes his
   Quest of Spirit
   he can't even cognize a
   female alter ego
   that is actually female. Hence, Ace Dick has an alter ego, referred to as Li'l Ace Dick, that is another copy of himself that goes around wearing a wig as if he is female. The wig eventually turns back into its
   Innocuous Double
   , a helmet, which he then wears for a short time to fight

   Belly of the Whale
   and swallows LAD whole. LAD does get the last attack by detonating two

   Because hot sauce increases
   Vim
   and this particular hot sauce is especially potent, Fiesta Ace Dick has a Vim stat far higher even than Ace Dick's, allowing him to use weapons with extraordinary
   encumbrance
   , move very heavy objects, and destroy busts with
   bratwurst
   like fingers. However, his
   pulchritude
   is very low, and he has no
   imagination
   to speak of. Fiesta Ace Dick has what is probably the largest
   Health Aegis
   in the game, the Frijole Aegis. He lost only three beans from an attack as powerful as the
   Cinder Ablockalypse
   , and has about a million more, making him practically indestructible.

Presumably, his Aegis is still intact, once again making him nigh invincible short of 1 hit kills. Before he could use his awesome Latin Vim again, he was sucked in by Ace Dick to allow Ace to become strong enough to shut Death's door.
