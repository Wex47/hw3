   The seven gates are a reference to the seven chakras, also referred to as gates by many. By opening a chakra, one enters a new level of understanding with one's self. The eighth chakra is unity with the universe, or enlightenment, so Skaia would be considered the eighth chakra since it gives infinite creative potential with the universe. Frog temples have seven spirographs on the sides and at the top instead of the Skaia spirograph, have a frog on top. The frog represents the universe, so this would be be another allusion to unity with the universe in the eight gate.
