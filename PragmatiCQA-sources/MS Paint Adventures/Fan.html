   The purpose of the fan is to blow
   Pickle Inspector
   's safe door closed, since he lacks the
   Vim
   to do it himself. PI has known to become homoerotically interested in his fan, and has even received
   divine guidance
   concerning it.

   At one point in the story PI places his fan through the activated
   Jacuzzi
   , causing it to appear in the
   Imaginary City Streets
   and land on the bottom half of the
   Candy Mecha
   . The Mecha blasted off, carrying the now-enormous fan to
   Whore Island
   . Its plug crashed through the roof of the
   Sleazy Brothel in the Sky
   .

   Hysterical Dame
   and
   Nervous Broad
   decided that activating the giant fan is of the utmost importance, and embarked on a fantastic whore-filled adventure to alter the plug's aspect and scale enough so it could couple with a standard-sized outlet in
   Madame Murel's Studio
   . They even went through the trouble of defeating
   Madame Murel
   in personal combat in order to give it power.

   Godhead Pickle Inspector
   used
   the fan cord to sew the
   imaginary universe
   back together after
   Demonhead Mobster Kingpin
   tore it in half. It would therefore take billions and billions of years for
   electricity
   to run from its power source on
   Whore Island
   , traverse the entire universe twice, and finally reach the fan, turning it on.

  <p key="c18b2d48-e80c-4d58-a481-997552692a96">
   Due to a
   black hole
   and some weird
   science
   , the fan actually succeeded in turning on. Surprisingly, Hysterical Dame and Nervous Broad's quest to supply the fan with power resulted in the accomplishment of a critical move, pushing the precious
   Snoop bust
   off the
   Candy Mecha
   , and causing it to fall through the
   Labrynthine Sudocube Comprehsensile
   , which in turn led the bust to be sucked into the black hole and deal damage to
   DMK
   's
   fetal seedpod
   .
