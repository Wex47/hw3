   After
   Problem Sleuth
   diplomatically solved the
   plight of the four kingdoms
   , he gained the ability to commune with them from afar. The kingdoms assembled their finest heroes and sent them forth to climb the
   Cathedral of Syndetic Ascension
   . The merry band consists of a
   Weasel
   Warrior, a
   Hog
   Cleric, an
   Elf
   Mage and a
   Clown
   Bard. Each Hero hails from a different kingdom, and has abilities similar to games played from Dungeons and Dragons:

   <li key="6ea2f7cd-47be-49fa-9849-2f90c585e849">
    The Weasel Warrior uses his disciplined
    Flipping the Fuck Out
    technique to slice enemies with his sword.
   </li>
   <li key="b146110c-8166-405d-b60c-910ab5dccbd7">
    The Elf Mage can cast a variety of destructive and utility spells to assist the other heroes and defeat enemies using his
    majyyk
    wand.
   </li>
   <li key="3db34d53-a052-483d-a0db-64e11ecf746e">
    The awkward and somewhat inept Hog Cleric casts a variety of healing abilities with his Crook of Fealty to keep the band healthy. The Cleric also can summon
    salted melons
    .

   <li key="3058b013-8ea2-47c0-8769-0f2ed48e47ba">
    The Clown Bard, equipped with only a
    Lute
    , can play songs to affect the material plane. The Clown Bard is also capable of incendiary
    Lute Solos
    .

   The Heroes managed to best countless foes, such as
   Garnghut Blistershod
   , during their climb up the
   Cathedral of Syndetic Ascension
   , make crucial adjustments to the
   Clock Tower of Cartesian Alignment
   , and lead the charge against
   Dark Matter Mobster Kingpin
   before being sucked into his
   black hole
   . There, they proved to be absolutely useless.

   The Clown Bard is not to be confused with the
