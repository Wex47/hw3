   Becquerel shares the same birthday as John,
   April 13
   - however, he came to Earth millions of years ago, long before the Kids did. He was created by the
   Draconian Dignitary
   using the DNA encoded from
   Rose's notebook
   , and that of the dog
   <a href="Halley.html" key="eb02c114-b3c3-4f11-933d-b680f45a77e4" title="Halley">

   in the
   Frog Temple
   meteor lab. The omnipotent puppy-Bec was seen destroying the lab just as
   the Reckoning
   was beginning. The
   Authority Regulator
   witnessed this event, and it led to him recognizing Bec's face on a pumpkin when he became the
   Aimless Renegade
   . The creation of Bec is most likely the reason the gods from the
   <a href="Furthest Ring.html" key="685bb6c1-3c33-4ad7-aa47-fbeb5d405ed2" title="Furthest Ring">
    Furthest Ring
   </a>
   believed it was important to destroy Rose's notebook, though since they seem to have an understanding of temporal inevitability, it is very unlikely they thought that stopping Bec's creation was a possibility.
  </p>
  <p key="6daba4af-fa47-4eea-b966-e56878988d15">
   The Frog Temple meteor was sent onto Earth by a
   Skaian
   portal, and crashed into
   Jade's Island
   . Lava from the nearby volcano flowed into the impact crater and the young Becquerel was seen emerging from the lava pool.
  </p>
  <p key="7edab667-84ac-4b20-9507-ab74864ed176">
   He is next seen observing Grandpa Harley's and Jade's arrival to the island from a distance. He eventually becomes their loyal pet. Bec is undoubtedly Jade's guardian, as he seems to be the only other sentient being on the island we know of. It is a role he inherited from Grandpa after his death.
  </p>
  <p key="46f95072-f3c4-4def-93a5-bda3310d8088">
   When a
   dreaming Jade
   attempted to investigate his arrival on earth in a Skaian cloud, Becquerel appeared in front of her and blocked her from investigating. In the dream world, she was stopped from looking at a glowing white orb with the Sburb spirograph logo in it; meanwhile, in the real world, the Dreambot, which was mimicking the actions, was denied entry to the
   Frog Temple
   . It is unknown what secrets Bec was trying to keep from Jade.
  </p>
  <p key="94119a4b-6fe7-45e5-8659-25147ef0da9b">
   After Jade's dreambot explodes, destroying her bedroom and sending Jade falling to the ground far below, Bec is seen watching from a distance as a colossal meteor bears down on the island. As expected, Bec finally
   shortly after the beginning of

    Jade
   </a>
   is about to enter
   the Medium
   , Bec prototypes himself and destroys the
   meteor
   inbound for Jade, and even redirects her bullet into the
   Bec-shaped piñata
   . This generates an explosion that reaches all the way to Dave's city in Texas, and possibly across the entire Earth, sparing only
   Jade's Island
   . This is probably largely responsible for wiping out humanity on Earth before the
   Exiles
   arrived.

   Becsprite appears in its Skaia prototyping form on Earth, rather than after entering the medium. Presumably this was done for stylistic purposes as a floating Bec head is kind of silly looking.
  </p>
  <p key="2f76b429-d473-45d9-befa-3e708e32d898">
   After his entry to the Medium alongside Jade, he blows up the
   Peregrine Mendicant
   's computer when she tries to contact her. Even as a sprite, he seems to remain incapable of speech, and talks in giant blocks of flickering images containing no text.
  </p>
  <p key="d4375dc8-33f4-4e93-baad-3fd1a8c8d452">
   Bec's second and final prototyping was with the taxidermied corpse of Jade's dream self, the new sprite being a combination of Bec and Jade, known as
   Jadesprite
   . Since Jadesprite's personality overrode Bec's, and then Jade ascended to god tier, he was presumed to be permanently removed from existence. This was later confirmed by him being crossed out in the
   However, even after ascension Jade occasionally displays dog-like behavior, like barking at meowing cats, so it seems that minor parts of Bec's personality have survived in Jade. This is further supported by the fact that

   After
   Jack
   gets prototyped with Bec, he also gains some of his traits, such as thinking of dog treats and mailmen. He also gains feelings of loyalty and even love towards Jade which led to him being unable to kill her. Apparently these feelings are so strong that he could not even bring himself to destroy a banner that bore her symbol.

   Jade says she couldn't accomplish such a task if she tried. This has proven to be true as, despite her shooting at him several times with her rifle, he is unharmed; Bec simply alters space to avoid being hit by the bullet. He also seems to have fantastic speed; not only does he seem to be able to perceive and interact with bullets as if they were barely moving, but he can also run ahead of them quite a distance, allowing him to fetch bullets in mid-air. Jade never knows what Bec is doing, so it is assumed that he does not show up in the prophetic cloud images on Skaia. It is possible that Bec is controlling time and space so that he may keep his doings a secret from his young charge. This directly corresponds with his manner of introduction to the story. He was initially only seen in very vague ways - first as a carving on a

   After fetching a stick on what appears to be Jade's island, Bec teleports to various other locations around the world. He catches a baseball at an official-looking game mid-pitch, intercepts another dog's frisbee at a beach, steals a cricket bat, and picks up a football in the middle of a game. We see a flurry of other sports bats and balls, as he returns home to a large pile of them near the stairwell. Looking pleased with himself, he settles down on the bed in Jade's room, to which she remarks that he's
