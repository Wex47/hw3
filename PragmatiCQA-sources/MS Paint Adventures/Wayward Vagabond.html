   The Vagabond has a deep, intense hatred for Kings, whom he sees as bossy tyrants, stemming from his past as the Warweary Villein. Instead of royalty, he likes the concept of democratically elected mayors, to the point of building '
   Can Town
   ,' a town made out of cans of food, and being its mayor. He sets the cans in a "military training" session that is remarkably like a game of chess, for four hours and nine minutes. (It is interesting to note that all his activities within the station seem to mirror various prophecies within the story, such as how "black defeats white" in his game of chess, and the uncanny correlation between his seemingly random city backdrops and actual planets within the story and their positions in the universe. However, this could simply indicate a lack of creativity on the Vagabond's part, seeing as all this would technically be history to him.)

   While the Vagabond hates Kings, he is quite reverent and respectful of the the former White Queen. He and the Aimless Renegade quickly craft a crown to gift her upon sight.

   The Vagabond is very critical of himself when he thinks dumb ideas (player commands), calling himself stupid and feeling dislike towards himself for a short time after. This could probably be because he has a permanent negative outlook on himself after the death of his fellow pawns at the hands of Jack. He therefore beats himself up on small mistakes he makes.

After WV was unceremoniously gutted by Bec Noir, PM donned the Queen's ring and teleported him to the

   WV is seen to trust John, despite his original rudeness. This may be due to their many encounters, the first of which was their meeting on the battlefield when he was WV?, in which John gave him the wallet and the ring to keep safe. The many commands that WV gave John, while delivered in a seemingly rude manner, shows that WV at the very least trusts John enough to carry out actions that decide the fate of entire planets. While they have not interacted much since then, it can be assumed that the trust remains. (Though, if Dave and WV are best bros, what about John?)
