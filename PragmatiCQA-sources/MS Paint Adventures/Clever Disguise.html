   It combines
   Fetch Modi

   Queuestack
   Modus, with both the first and last cards being simultaneously accessible, as well as an Array and a Queue and a Stack to create an Array of Queuestacks. It has six slots, potentially allowing for much more complex Modus combinations.

  <p key="5f036b3e-c0fa-4a59-a075-72aabac286bc">
   It is possible that the order in which the cards are inserted alters the resulting hybrid Modus. For example, were the Array cartridge inserted before the others, John may have ended up with a Queuestack of Arrays, or something to that effect. Also of note is the fact that combining the Queue and Stack Modi caused John's Captchalogue Cards themselves to change in coloration and usage, while adding the Array card to the previous two only altered the Cards' organization within his Deck, except for the first card in each queuestack, which turned blue. This may be due to the obvious compatibility of the Queue and Stack Modi, which implies that the Modus Control Deck acts on Modi in predetermined ways and may create unexpected combinations when dealing with a Modus with which it is unfamiliar, though this is subject to question, considering the Array Fetch Modus actually came with the Modus Control Deck.

    Remote Ghost Gauntlets
   </b>
   are a pair of gloves that augment John's ability to carry objects. Each Gauntlet is itself a set of two gloves, a gray computer-glove that John wears, and a blue and slimy replica that mimics the movements of the gray glove. Not only does this enable John to grab objects out of arm's reach, but they act with proportionally increased strength, as the blue glove is able to wield the
   Telescopic Sassacrusher
   . The right-handed Gauntlet is created by combining one of the Fake Arms, the blue slime on his wall, and the
   PDA
   . The left-handed one is created by combining the right-handed Gauntlet with the bathroom mirror. Each comes at an expense of 32 build grist and 128 tar.

   was on John's dresser in his bedroom before he decided to hang it up on the wall. It evidently came from Dad as a gift for his thirteenth birthday. The poster was the third item to appear in John's
   Captchalogue Deck
   and led to the
   Fake Arms
   being dropped when John decided he would need a
   Hammer
   and the Nails to hang the poster on the wall next to his

   Once John combined his Hammer and Nails onto one Captchalogue card, he was able to use them on the poster to hang it on the wall. Doing this revealed it to be a
