   is, according to the author commentary of
   Homestuck book four
   , a game construct on
   Skaia
   's battlefield meant to assist with
   Black King
   . Following his demise, the platform changes color from green to gray and
   and consists of three thick lily pad shaped rings stacked on top of each other, with the symbolic image of a frog on the top of the platform, surrounded by a wide spirograph logo. Beneath the platform is a glowing sphere with the image of a narrower spirograph. It is unclear what triggers the platform itself to appear and whether or not it is simply present from the beginning of a session.

   What, if anything, the Reward includes beyond access to the new universe is currently unknown. It is implied
   that the reward for a normal session would include ruling over the created universe, but it is possible that the implication was more about
   Karkat
   's intentions than the reward itself. This is corroborated by
   on the matter.

   The A2
   trolls
   were
   prevented from claiming their Reward
   when the B1
   Jack Noir
   arrived in their
   Incipisphere
   and destroyed the door before they could open it. The A1 trolls and B1 kids were unable to win (though for
   different
   reasons
   ) and had to
   scratch
   their sessions. The B2 kids were stuck in a
   void session
   , but it became winnable post-retcon when the B1 kids arrived and the Condesce made Jade deposit their Battlefield into Skaia. After
   Collide
   , the B2 session was won, and its Reward was claimed.
   Caliborn
   and
   Calliope
   's dead sessions are unable to produce a new universe, so their victory and defeat conditions (and presumably their Ultimate Rewards) differ from that of a normal session.

    The Ultimate Reward structure in the B2 session was initially colored like the Sburb Alpha logo, but faced the same way as the Sburb Beta logo. After the
    Genesis Frog
    matured, the logo flipped to the Alpha orientation and turned white before the door to the new universe appeared. This may reflect the fact that the session was a unique situation which required the combination of assets from two different sessions to make the game winnable.
