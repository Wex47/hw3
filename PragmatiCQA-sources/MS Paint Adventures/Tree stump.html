However, the other man has died, and after all they went through together, he felt hollow going on living without his friend and soon killed himself. Rather than the stump causing this, the man could feasibly have been drawn to this by the trauma of the situation, enacted by the gun he brought there himself.

All future iterations of the stump also feature the severed harpoon which the injured man shot the stump with, and ultimately died from.
