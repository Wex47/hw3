     Barty Anderson

   </i>
   is a fictional character portrayed by Byron Hussie, in a series of three short films and several later video blogs produced by Byron and his brother,

   , among numerous collaborators, including Cindy Dominguez,
   Nic Carey
   and
   Michael Firman
   . Andrew and Byron both play multiple roles across the films. An unofficial fourth installment, featuring Kenny Herndon as Barty, was released in 2015.

   Barty is an outdoorsman, survivalist, and amateur cryptozoologist who always wears a balaclava and a thick (fake) moustache, and speaks in a strange falsetto. As explained in the second video, Barty hosts a
   cable access
   programme, of which the videos seem to be excerpts. He searches for and discusses cryptozoological creatures such as
   Bigfoot
   and
   the Yeti
   , and educates viewers on techniques for wilderness survival. Segments on the programme usually begin with Barty taking a moment to press ‘play’ on a recording of Jerry Goldsmith's theme to the 1984 film

   The videos were originally posted to

   As per his custom, Barty (Byron) presses ‘play’ on his CD player and introduces himself, then gives an educational rant on Bigfoot. He invites the audience to accompany him on a Bigfoot hunt. During the hunt, Barty finds a flashlight from a previous hunt, but Bigfoot seems to be proving elusive. That is, until he (in the form of Andrew in a gorilla suit) pops out of nowhere and assaults Barty.

  <p key="ff20011c-dd68-4c46-8a3b-47039a293452">
   Later, apparently unharmed by the ordeal, Barty commences another segment of the programme. In preparation for another Bigfoot search, he attempts to give a short lecture on flashlights, but is unexpectedly interrupted by Bigfoot, who again assaults him. In the next segment, Barty is unable to complete even his introductory monologue before being assaulted by Bigfoot, and the video concludes amidst his protests.

   Barty takes the audience on a tour of
   Philadelphia Zoo
   ; as he fumbles around on the Zoo's Gorilla statue, the programme is interrupted by a voiceover from a man (Andrew) who introduces himself as parapsychologist

    Stewart Clammington
   </b>
   . The man explains that he is searching for the remains of one Franklin Linkletter (played in flashback by Byron), a former client of his who has a large quantity of gold concealed in his corpse, and that he has enlisted Barty's tracking expertise to aid him in finding the gold. Clammington meets with Barty, and after some survival demonstrations, the two embark on their search.
  </p>
  <p key="a84a7e6f-e2e7-4a85-b8e7-5185cbe90058">
   Before long, Clammington's motives begin to seem increasingly murky, and he soon separates himself from Barty, revealing to the audience that he intends to hunt Barty, the perfect prey, for sport. Barty quickly spots the ineptly hidden Clammington, who manages to lead Barty on for a short while longer, in time for Barty to reach the point where he believes Linkletter's remains should lie. Pointing out that neither the body nor the gold are there, Clammington chastises Barty. Barty promptly receives a vision of Linkletter, instructing him to "follow the lights", which causes him to trek to an abandoned quarry, where he is once again disappointed to find no gold. Clammington reappears with a revelation: he has already found the gold, and he intends to kill Barty.
  </p>
  <p key="12508ada-200f-481a-a278-55a1e135d5f7">
   Clammington pursues Barty, stalking him through the quarry until Barty disarms him of his knife, and the two engage in a brutal fistfight. Clammington subdues Barty, and reveals the extent of his psychopathy, imitating Barty's distinctive voice and claiming that, through Barty's death, the two of them will become one. Clammington then draws a heretofore unseen revolver, and shoots Barty three times at point blank range, before unceremoniously dropping the gun on Barty's crotch. The video ends with a dedication to Barty's memory.

   in 2007, but, as the site is now defunct, that edit can be considered lost. Andrew has stated that he feels the shorter edit improves the pacing of the video, and that the final fight scene is slightly tighter. The video suffers from severe
   interlacing
   artifacts; Andrew wished to rectify this with the YouTube upload, but the currently-available upload is still affected.

   During a birthday celebration, Barty expresses a wish to search for the Yeti, in order to resume his former cryptozoological activities, and the two brothers soon set out, with Barty strapped to a makeshift "flotilla". After some time without progress, Cash believes he sees a Yeti, and gives chase, leaving Barty propped against a tree. Cash's "Yeti" turns out to be non-existent, and the chase results only in Barty falling over.
  </p>
  <p key="91ab6245-31d8-4eb0-b8de-d3c4a168b606">
   As a result of the unsuccessful expedition, Cash realizes that it is time to put Barty through a regimen of physical therapy, in order to restore him to a non-crippled state. The therapy proves successful, and Barty is soon able to make a triumphant return to his traditional monologue, where he announces his intention to continue the search for the Yeti.

   The brothers prepare to set out yet again, this time by car, but Barty insists that, before they depart, he must check the car's tire pressure as a safety precaution. While he is behind the car, Cash mistakenly reverses and runs Barty over. Upon realizing what he has done, Cash flees the scene, leaving Barty lying motionless where he was hit. The video concludes with another memorial to Barty.

   The third video was released in 2007, shortly after the online release of the second. The biggest obstacle to the production, according to Cindy Dominguez, was convincing Byron to return to the lead role for a third time, and this meant it is likely to be the last entry in the series (although Cindy said this prior to the release of the video blogs).

  <p key="7dc16465-24f6-4bbb-b6e6-4a31e745ba69">
   Fans have noted that each of the videos seems to take place in a different house; the theory that Barty is homeless and uses other people's houses has been proposed as an explanation. The theory would also explain Barty's penchant for trash-diving, revealed in the second video. Byron
   implicit support for the theory, saying that Barty could have learned his survivalist skills as a result of being "homeless and completely unemployable". Alternatively, the different settings are explained by the years-long spans between the productions of the videos, Byron and the others likely having moved multiple times during these periods.

   Barty (Kenny Herndon) begins his adventure claiming that he'd been "busy as a bumblebee" in the eight years since his last appearance in 2007, providing a recap of the previous two films, as well as detailing his recovery at a monastery in "northeastern Tibet".

   Continuing his perpetual search for the Yeti, Barty discusses the Yeti's traditional Zoroastrian beliefs and attempts unsuccessfully to climb a tree. He returns home to enjoy a breakfast of poorly-prepared grits, and is back outside after claiming to have tracked the scent (composed of AXE body spray and rotting bananas) of a Yeti. He's suddenly interrupted by a

   During a monologue, Barty is interrupted by a call from the nefarious Stewart Clammington, who taunts Barty. Barty retires to his 'happy place' to relax after Clammington's mockery. During his meditation, he is tormented by visions of dogs, eventually passing out and awakening in the presence of the Deli Master, who reiterates his cryptic remarks about the Crystal Chubacabra, before vanishing ominously.

   Barty accepts the task of tracking the Crystal Chubacabra without much ado, embarking to track the creature, and briefly mistaking a knot in a tree for it. Suddenly, Barty is struck by a heat wave, and is briefly incapacitated. Upon recovery, he provides valuable notes on how to avoid drowning in such a wave.

   The scene abruptly cuts to Barty plodding about in a field of overgrown grass, with a narrating voice revealing that the Fake Barty had "disappeared in a wisp", leaving Barty alone once more without purpose. Barty, laying prone in the field, is disturbed by the Crystal Chubacabra (portrayed by two black dogs, one with short hair and one with longer hair). Barty is pleased with this discovery, and begins to present the audience with some essential survival tips before being distracted by the Deli Master, whom he attempts to beckon. The Fake Barty returns, and claims that the Deli Master is supposed to be Barty's enemy, but is not. Barty doesn't understand, and is blown away by the Fake Barty.

   Barty's reading of the note is punctuated by Clammington's laughter, and he reveals himself as the camera operator. With a butter knife drawn, Clammington gives chase to the fleeing Barty. Barty is eventually thrown to the floor, begging for mercy, until he is able to temporarily disarm Clammington and flee. Barty loses him, coming to rest at a Yeti shrine.

   Both the Deli Master and the Fake Barty convene, each revealing themself to be a manifestation of Barty's
   psyche
   ; the Fake Barty being his super-ego, the Deli Master being his ego, and Clammington representing his id. Barty is overwhelmed by the Deli Master, Fake Barty, and Clammington's voices, which culminate in repetition of the word "keep". Barty collapses on the ground as the voices fall silent.

   In 2010, Byron decided to update Barty's web presence, posting new videos to the Barty Anderson YouTube account and later giving him social media accounts on
   and
   . The first three videos are video blogs, where Barty addresses his audience on various topics. The first invites audience members to join Barty in the quest to finally prove the existence of cryptozoological creatures, by becoming a "Barty Scout" (a term he just then made up). The second video blog is a rumination on whether the Illuminati and the Freemasons control the Hip Hop industry. In the third, Barty shows off his new Bigfoot tattoo, and admits that he doesn’t have much else going on. The next, and to date latest, video contains Barty’s tips on boat safety, given from the back of a kayak. Since the video blogs, Barty's official web presence is mostly confined to sporadic tweets, and the occasional "special guest appearance" on Byron's podcasts.
