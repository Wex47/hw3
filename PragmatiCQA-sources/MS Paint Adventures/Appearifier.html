It is possible to use the science of Ectobiology to create a clone of what you had tried to appearify from its ghost sludge, but if a perfect paradox clone of a person is created, the clone is fated to become the original being which you paradox cloned in the first place.

   The Appearifier is precise enough to free

   from her amber prison, while being wide enough to appearify the entire chunk of amber, firefly and all, only seconds before. It was also able to remove all six grates from the underground base's entrance despite them not being in contact with one another. The convenience of these operations seems to suggest some level of context sensitivity. However, the teleported bars of the grate are approximately the size of the platform. We can assume half an oblate (?) spheroid the radius of which is equal to that of the radius of the platform and the height radius equal to the distance between the emitter and the platform. Objects teleported but not wholly contained within the teleport field show severe side effects. The bars of the grate, for instance, are glowing white hot at their ends, possibly due to stress from being torn away from the adjoining matter. The density of the material may affect how much energy is imparted to it during the sub-molecular disjointing process.

   It cannot "deappearify" objects and you should feel bad for even thinking such idiotic thoughts. This means that the user is unable to teleport objects from the appearifier to any place in space or time; objects must be removed manually. It also means that any objects that get appearified, purposefully or not, can't be sent back. (A
   Sendificator
   fulfills this purpose.)
