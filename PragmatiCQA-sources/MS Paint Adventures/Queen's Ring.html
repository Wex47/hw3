   The Rings are made of a gold band with orbs floating around its edge. The number of orbs is determined by the number of Kernelsprites prototyped pre-entry in the session; in a typical session, this is equivalent to the number of players. Each orb begins to glow for each player that prototypes their Kernelsprite and enters The Medium, much like the spires on Prospit and Derse.
   Carapacian
   wearers of the Ring are transformed into a prototyped being and are granted the powers and physical aspects from each prototyping.
  </p>
  <p key="14e915dd-94a3-49f2-aca2-659ddf7d1d2b">
   The Rings also possess powers separate from the prototyping powers. The Black Queen's ring enables the wearer to use a highly dangerous attack known as
   Red Miles
   , which is powerful enough to destroy an entire universe when powered up by prototyping a first guardian. It is unknown if the White Queen's ring has the same or an equivalent power.

    The Black Queen's ring has the power to summon the Red Miles, as demonstrated by Jack Noir in [S] Descend. As the Miles have been said to have infinite reach, this may be a reference to the queen's potential on a chessboard, which is infinite movement in every direction possible.
