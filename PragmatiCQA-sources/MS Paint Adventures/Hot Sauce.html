   Pickle Inspector
   has a large bottle of hot sauce in
   his office
   . It was fairly tame hot sauce; the boost in Pickle Inspector's Vim still wasn't enough to allow him to wield the
   Machine Gun
   , and the effect wore off after the overhead sprinklers cooled him off. This was due to Pickle Inspector's maximum possible Vim being horribly insufficient.

   When combined with
   illicit moonshine
   and shit, hot sauce creates an unpleasant slurry.

    5 Alarm Hot Sauce
   </b>
   is an extremely potent type of hot sauce. The alchemical formula for the list of ingredients came from a
   Code Machine
   . It was created by combining three different types of horns, spicy protrusions dropped by horny
   beasts
   when they are killed, and the chipotle pepper that had been stored under
   Ace Dick
   's hat and leaving it to ferment and simmer in a
   still
   . The resulting explosion is phenomenal and leaves behind a shimmering liquid which tastes like intense pain.

   Ace Dick consumed a quantity of 5 Alarm Hot Sauce, transforming him into
   Fiesta Ace Dick
   , permanently increasing his Vim by massive amounts. Later, when
   Mobster Kingpin
   consumed a quantity of Fiesta Ace Dick, he transformed into
   Fiesta Mobster Kingpin
   .
