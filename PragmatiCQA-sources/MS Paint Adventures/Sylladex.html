   The word "captchalogue" is a portmanteau of the words "captcha" and "catalogue". The word "captcha" hints the codes on the back of each card.

   However, there is a limit to how many different items can be captchalogued, based on the number of cards in the character's deck. Captchalogue cards can be added to the Captchalogue Deck by captchaloguing them and then forcing them out of the deck by doing something like adding an item, which at least the Stack deck will react to by putting the item into a card that holds the card the user is trying to add to their deck
   . Once a player has too many cards to line up side-by-side on the screen, the cards are arranged in stacks. Early on, John's deck is arranged in thirteen stacks of four, mimicking the suits and ranks of playing cards (which, like captchalogue cards, come in decks) as well as the
   main arc number
   of the comic.

   Also, living things can apparently be captchalogued, however it is unknown what it feels like to be inside a captchalogue card. It is also unknown if a person can captchalogue themselves, though this would probably be unlikely, since doing so would create an
   infinite recursive loop
   due to the captchalougue card being held by the player, who is stored in the card.

   Items can be combined by overlapping cards, thus obscuring some holes (like a bitwise AND operation) or by punching one card with both items' codes (like a bitwise OR operation). It appears that the operation used only determines which item used is the primary one, as seen with the Pogo Ride and the Sledgehammer; overlapping cards created a
   Pogo Hammer
   whereas double-punching a card made a Hammerhead Pogo Ride.

  <p key="aeafb8fb-8f18-47c0-b3f8-14b363e4385b">
   It appears that combining items rather than cards (i.e. drawing on a poster with crayon) still changes the item's code, similar to how the code would change if you simply combined the cards.

   The fashions in which artifacts are stored to and retrieved from the Sylladex depend on the currently active Fetch Modus. The active Fetch Modus can be chosen as long as the Sylladex has the card with the desired Fetch Modus. Each Fetch Modus has a unique color given to all Captchalogue cards in a Sylladex that uses it. When outside of a Sylladex, Captchalogue cards are red. Each Fetch Modus is more different from the last: some Fetch Modi are based on data structures, some are based on popular board games, some are just mundane, like

   's first Sylladex Fetch Modus, signified by a bright magenta Sylladex and matching Captchalogue cards. Captchalogue cards are arranged in a stack, and the player can only use or otherwise interact with the one at the top of the stack. The top card may also be combined with the previous card if doing so is logical (or if the objects can be physically forced into one another), or use it with the previous card. If an object is picked up while the Sylladex is full, the item at the bottom of the stack will be dropped.

Not only does that have little relevance to Dave's question, but Dave was also able to identify Stack from this description, even though it could've applied to just about any other Modus. Though, this may be because it is a snarky answer avoiding the question, and if he was using something more interesting, he would have actually answered it.

   John uses the Modus Control Deck to combine his Stack, Queue, and Array Modi. It does seem much more interesting to use than an Array modus, but has less accessibility to captchalogued items. The way this Modus works is it divides all the captchalogue cards into 4 arrayed Queuestacks with 6 cards each. From there, John can take a Card from the first or last card from any of the Queuestacks.

   's Fetch Modus, Trees, is signified by a lime green Sylladex and matching Captchalogue cards. She admits that it isn't exactly practical but initially considers it elegant. The first item is captchalogued in the Root Card. Any more items that are picked up are Branches attached to an existing card and, like the root itself, may have up to two branches of their own (making this a binary tree). Branches with no further branches of their own are called Leaf Cards. Cards are sorted alphabetically: they join the left branch of an existing card if they come alphabetically before that card, or the right branch otherwise. Nothing has been shown to demonstrate what happens if she has two identical objects. The only cards Rose may access are the root or leaf cards; intermediate branches can only be accessed by moving them to the root or leaf positions via the optional auto-balancing feature, which (like an AVL tree) rearranges the tree whenever it becomes too unbalanced. If she uses the Root Card, all of the items below will fall out of the sylladex, which is why she has set it to Leaf instead of Root.

   's Fetch Modus, signified by a yellow Sylladex and matching Captchalogue cards. Hash maps work through
   , making the Hash Map Fetch Modus the most like a traditional inventory. Each card in the deck is given an index from zero to the number of cards in the deck minus 1 (10 cards leaves an index range of 0 to 9). When an item is captchalogued into a Hash Map Sylladex, where it is placed into the card stack depends on the current Hash Function. If an object already occupies the card with the produced index, the item in the card is ejected from the Sylladex to make room for the new item. In order to retrieve an item from the stack, the character must perform an action related to the item with a keyword that will produce the same index as the card that holds the desired item. Items apparently are retrieved so long as a relevant command with an equivalent hash is uttered, regardless of Dave's actual desire to use the item. If the objects are retrieved this way, they are thrown out as if another item was placed in their card. Dave once
   by yelling "stop" (hash 7) at it, killing it. Dave's reaction implies this was not intentional. The force of which the item ejects from the Sylladex may be related to how much emphasis is used on the command.
  </p>
  <p key="3323b630-e886-4e9e-b959-fef1b72fe50c">
   On the back of the fetch modus card are several options. One of them, a "potentially dangerous button," ejects every item in the Sylladex. Another option allows the user to change the hash function used to calculate indexes, though changing the hash function will eject all items too. A final option is a check box labelled 'detect collisions' which originally was unchecked. Now that it's checked, Dave is prevented from captchaloging an item when doing so will cause another item to be displaced and ejected, making captchaloging slower but safer.
  </p>
  <p key="1abf3728-a231-46b7-9fe4-1dc1960feb44">
   It is notable that objects that are captchalogued don't have a set name. For example, Dave captchalogued multiple Shuriken (3) one at a time to avoid dislodging a Box (5) he had filled with Fireworks (5). This is after he spilled the Box of Fireworks (3) by replacing it with Nunchaku (3). Items that share the same index can be combined even if the combined name of the items wouldn't equal that index.

   . This one is orange with yellow vertical stripes on the left side. It's unknown what the modus actually is, but considering the number of cards Davesprite left Dave, and how easily he uses it, it's suggested to be something far less annoying; based on the colors, it could be a hash map combined with a series of queues to resolve collisions, which is how hash maps are usually used in the real world.

If the sylladex is full, the leftmost item is
   For retrieval purposes, a captchalogued item is stored in two random cards. In order to access an item, the two cards in which that item is stored must be selected, and it appears that all item positions are randomized when an item is captchalogued. For most people, this would be troublesome to say the least, but for the reason stated above, this Modus is perfectly suited to Jade. Also, her silly, playful nature causes her to flesh out her Sylladex with simple, brightly-colored objects (such as fruit, as we have seen), causing it to more closely resemble a child's card-matching game. During the fit of pages where the wrong items are selected (Mostly fruits), one has to understand that it's not Jade making the choices as she gives the reader control, while giving "hints." These hints were actually 100% correct, while the reader was a dumbass and picked elsewhere regardless.

   Based upon the nervewracking game of manipulating precariously-placed blocks, this Modus uses eighteen captchalogue cards, which are dark blue and violet. When the Modus is selected, it spawns a Jenga tower made of 54 Captchalogue Blocks (54 being the number of blocks in a standard Jenga tower). Each item, when captchalogued, is assigned to three random blocks in the tower. To retrieve an item, its three blocks must be removed. When an attempt is made to retreive a specific item, its blocks are highlighted. If the tower is toppled, all items assigned to completely toppled trios of blocks will be ejected. This system appears to be extremely unwieldy, due to the likely difficulty in moving the tower. Also, while unknown earlier, Vriska practices putting Jade to sleep, making this Fetch Modus completely useless to her.

   Jade chose this Fetch Modus based on a strong whim from the

Drawing a nearby item on it results in the captchaloguing of that item. Even if the drawing is a meaningless scribble, the Scribblepad will associate it with an item. If the Captchaloguing of an item that is not nearby is attempted, a ghost image of it will be captchalogued instead. Ghost images are unusable but have the same Captchalogue codes as their real counterparts, enabling a Sburb player with access to alchemical equipment to create them.

It is more or less the Array Modus without size restriction, and with tangibility, meaning the entire Sylladex can be passed from person to person. The Modus component seems to be bound to its physical wallet counterpart. When John finds it, he discovers that this Modus has, in addition to an 'eject' button, a 'polish' button

   Jane Crocker
   's Fetch Modus, signified by red Captchalogue cards and a white
   Betty Crocker
   logo on the cartridge. It is a fairly new experimental innovation. Anything captchalogued will be added to a recipe book. Flipping the card, instead of showing the item's captchalogue code, shows a 'recipe list' of what items could be combined to
   alchemize
   it (it is noted in the story that the recipe framework is completely theoretical, since, at the time, Sburb, with its alchemy system, was yet to be played). Other than this, it seems to function identically to the Array Modus. It's worth noting that different recipes on the back of the same card have vastly different
   grist
   costs. This could mean a number of things - either different combinations resulting in exactly the same item have separate costs, or the recipes are actually for different variations of the item instead of being for the exact object and captchalogue code on the card. Perhaps even that the codes themselves are just one variable in determining the content of the card, and the amount/type of grist is also counted (explaining how the
   Gristwidget
   is able to recycle stored items; consider that combining two items results in the same code as combining two other items, yet results are different because of differing proportions of grist cost. The scale of grist cost is then used to determine the item's size). The modus also allows the user to captchalogue several items at once.

   The nature of the Hash Table modus is unknown, but some conjecture can be made, based on the Hash Map modus and the corresponding data structures: While a hashmap stores key/value pairs (being a string of letters and an item for the Hash Map modus), a hash table only stores values, and does not need a key to pair with values. Likewise, the Hash Table hashes the item being stored, rather than the key used to represent it. Therefore, retrieving an item already in the table does not need the key to be hashed a second time: instead, the index of the item is used directly. As a result, the Hash Table modus likely works similarly to the Array modus, except that each item can be inserted only into one specific index (and, presumably, is more easily weaponized).

   ' Fetch Modus, signified by grey Captchalogue cards. When an item is captchalogued, a card safe (with a weight possibly invariably greater than that of the item captchalogued) is produced. To retrieve an item, you have to hack the code to open the card safe. Since the safes become physical objects, the very obvious drawback to this modus is the inability to take the safes with you; they just end up recaptchalogued into a (perhaps guaranteed heavier) card safe. Supposedly, Karkat eventually swaps modi with

   The Modus seems to work a bit like two of the seen Jade's Modi, Memory and Jenga, in the fashion that it stores the captchalogued item in multiple cards. However, it is complicated by the fact that the cards themselves have seven colors: teal, green, orange, brown, blue, yellow and citrine, and the Modus seems to only use one card (if any) of each. When retrieving an object, the sylladex can eject an item from a seemingly random card very, very far. These are most likely not its only functions. It has been noted that successfully retrieving the item you want with this modus can take a miracle. Despite outward appearances showing this modus to be exceedingly complex, it has the potential to be the most useful modus of all. After having his soda chucked across the entire troll ocean, Gamzee is shown to be able to simply reach into one of the cards and take the item he wanted (Though this may just be Gamzee, of all characters, to even ponder the thought as most other people are confused by practical thinking, such as
   ). This shows that the modus can hold several items at once, and all can be accessed at any time. And bonus, shiny colors! However, this is probably overthinking, and it is just incredibly random in its function, as the name miracle implies that there is no science to it.

   ) use the same kind of Fetch Modus, which has green cards (with slightly different shades depending on whether the character is on Earth or Alternia) although Jude had grey cards in early development footage. As
   by the lead writer, for the purpose of convenience to you, the player, these Modi do not have ridiculous restrictions or awkward rules unless examined in detail, instead working like a typical adventure game inventory. It is still a sylladex, though, as the characters will on occasion refer to captchalogue-related terminology.

   It has three distinct portions. The main portion on the left can store any number of items (and will appear to generate captchalogue cards as more items are stored), and its items can be used with any other item or any background detail, giving it the functionality of the Array Modus with a potentially unlimited number of captchalogue cards. However, they are not dropped at will by the player, only when the characters themself choose to; As the items picked up become relevant later during the plot, dropping them at any time would be frustating. To the right of the main portion is the Techniche, the Hiveswap equivalent of the

   where
   Abilitechs
   are placed, and further to the right is a single slot which only stores communication devices, such as walkie-talkies and tablets.

  <p key="a7258605-52ec-4716-b731-5a7e16aa7985">
   The captchalogued items can be automatically transferred to other slots if functional for the purpose: when Joey picks up her walkie-talkie and its batteries separately they appear in her main sylladex, but when combined and the walkie-talkie is powered it immediately moves to the communicator slot. Her
   flashlight
   is stored in the Techniche slot even before she finds the batteries for it, but Joey can use it as a blunt weapon in a maneuver known as "Pirouette and Bop", which does not require it working to be used as a weapon.
  </p>
  <p key="b169e097-d03e-4bbf-94bc-85bb947b85f2">
   The communicator slot can drop items involuntarily, as Joey does not carry her Walkie-Talkie from Earth to Alternia despite never purposefully dropping it. It's likely her communication device would not work there anyways and was therefore automatically dropped from the slot.

   The game
   in such a way that only three Abilitechs can be stored and used at will in any character's Techniche. However, as the item associated with the Abilitech will disappear even if it isn't properly picked up, this likely isn't intended behavior.
