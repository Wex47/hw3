    : Jade's Denizen is
    Echidna
    , the mother of all monsters in Greek mythology. Zeus allowed her to give birth in peace inside one of the caves of Crete so that the demigod heroes would have something to fight in the future.

     Weather
    </b>
    : The weather outside Jade's house is a sunny day. This probably relates to the life-giving energy given to the earth by the sun.

    Grandpa

    first guardian

     Guardian's Features
    </b>
    : Becquerel only has ears, which could relate to the idiom "to keep an ear to the ground", which means to stay alert and look for clues, which suits Bec. It could also relate to sound being vibrations, just like earthquakes are vibrations.

     Eye Color
    </b>
    : Jade's eyes are green, a color associated with plants, and grass which grows from the earth. Her name also ties in to this; as Jade is a green color as well as a semi-precious stone.

     Miscellaneous
    </b>
    : Jade's
    title
    as the Witch of Space also ties with her associated classical element, perhaps as what it references, Space, forms a direct contrast to her element of Earth. It is also possible that space refers to planets, which again ties back to Earth. Jade, unlike the other kids, lives on a coral atoll instead of on the mainland. Her
    planet
    , the Land of Frost and Frogs, is also heavily forested. Jade is also interested in horticulture (flora) as well as the furry fandom (fauna). Jade was seen wearing a shirt with a diamond-shaped Skaia-net logo. Diamonds are the equivalent of "coins/pentacles" in Tarot, which in turn represent the element of earth.
