   Demonhead Mobster Kingpin has multiple faces, each with its own health bar(s). In his original form, DMK was also covered in an impenetrable iron armor that had to be unlocked by using
   keys
   . Each time the health bars of one of his faces are depleted, DMK's
   Nether-Regional Vulnerabulb
   blooms, exposing his weak spot. When
   Team Sleuth
   manages to defeat two of the beast's forms, the hideous final face appears which is not truly vulnerable to anything other than
   righteous fires of charisma
   , but it is unknown if there is
   any hero with enough
   Pulchritude
   to wield it in the entire
   imaginary universe
   . Problem Sleuth appears to be able to wield the righteous fires of charisma through
   Sepulchritude
   , and deals an impressive amount of damage, taking down one of his health bars in a single hit, and with
   Sleuth Diplomacy

   Smith Corona Blotspitter
   combined, it has the power to take out ANOTHER one of DMK's health meters. His third face appears to have a
   Sick Burn
   meter, but it is unknown what it does, though it might have something to do with Sleuth Diplomacy lv. 99: Pax Probliscum being so powerful. DMK's third face can regenerate or create a lot of new health meters using the
   Ladder to Hell
   maneuver, making him invincible to all maneuvers other than
   Final Flip Out
   and the final explosion of
   Sepulchritude
   . Once Demonhead Mobster Kingpin was finally defeated, his body deployed a
   Fetal Seedpod
   , which if allowed to detach from the rest of the corpse, would have grown into a fully rejuvenated Demonhead Mobster Kingpin.

   Demonhead Mobster Kingpin was finally slain after the Snoop Bust collided with his Fetal Seedpod, nearly depleting his supply of
   Pep Gold
   . The remaining gold was finally eliminated when
   Problem Sleuth
   finally let go of his cherished
   candy corn
   he had been safeguarding for the entire adventure, allowing them to hit the Seedpod.
