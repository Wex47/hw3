   Jack Noir

   In the

   it is revealed that Jade's present is, like Rose's and Dave's, the bunny, but further modified. It has been modified with robotic parts, and can now move of its own accord. The bunny also wields four extremely powerful miniature weapons: the
   Warhammer Of Zillyhoo
   , the
   Quills of Echidna
   , the
   Royal Deringer
   , and
   Ahab's Crosshairs
   . These weapons are the four types of weapons the children use: hammer, needles, half-blade, and rifle. It is curious to note that the text refers to the bunny having a new master; that perhaps the bunny was the deciding factor in Jack Noir's rise to power, and how he realized it was a checkmate.
