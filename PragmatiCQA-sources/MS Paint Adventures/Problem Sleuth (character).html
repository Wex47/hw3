   Problem Sleuth tends to see himself as a hard-boiled prohibition-era detective, getting calls from
   Hysterical Dames
   while lazing about on his desk. He's has a penchant for monologuing in old 30's noir style at times, and it's a bit difficult to figure out what he's talking about occasionally. Initially in the beginning of the game, Problem Sleuth has trouble doing simple tasks, and tends to spend a lot of time doing absurd things such as stubbing his toe on cinder blocks, wrapping himself up in recording tape as a mummy, throwing his
   phone
   out the window, peeing on

   Ace Dick
   , as Ace Dick is able to get all the "good cases". This is most likely due to Problem Sleuth's own inability, or more probable that it's just because he's
   locked in his own office

   . As you progress through the game, and he achieves a few
   Victorious Moments

   While the other members of
   Team Sleuth
   have a lot of clones and duplicates to do their work for them while they're wasting a lot of time doing stupid commands and not getting a whole lot done, Problem Sleuth has none that have come directly from him. Due to this, his progression through the game involves his attacks coming directly from himself and his ability to use his
