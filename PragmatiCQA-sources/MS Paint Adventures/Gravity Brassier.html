    Gravity Brassier
   </b>
   is a
   scale bodice
   that was originally worn by
   Madame Murel
   . She was dispatched before she could use it. Soon after, it was acquired by
   Mobster Kingpin
   who used it to become
   Dark Matter Mobster Kingpin
   , and later,
   Black Hole Mobster Kingpin
   . Unlike normal bodices, instead of modifying
   height
   and
   vim
   ,
   mass
   and
   volume
   are modified. So far this has only been used to increase mass for defensive purposes.

   Just as the
   Aspect Corset
   and Scale Bodice lead to the
   Gutterpipe Projects
   , the Gravity Brassier corresponds to the great volcano
   Mount Saint Lardass
   .
