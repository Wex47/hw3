    Peregrine Mendicant

   is a rag-wrapped desert wanderer who lives in the year
   2422
   . She is an Exile, like the
   Wayward Vagabond
   . Before she was exiled, she was the Parcel Mistress. Her first appearance was in
   Act 2
   . She pushes a cart full of mailboxes as she is a devotee of mail and mail delivery, having a fervor for mail similar to WV's obsession with democracy as the mayor of Can Town. Unlike the Wayward Vagabond, she can type in an intelligent manner; she also shows a decent understanding of

   , such as when she understands that she has to send John the message telling him to carve the tablet that she received in the past. She is kind, has a deep loyalty towards mail, but will not hesitate to bring justice forth if needed, even if she dislikes it.

   All exiles each have multiple titles composed of two words. The first and second words of each title start with the same letter. Commands for an exile's past self begin with a question mark (?). The Peregrine Mendicant is also known as the Parcel Mistress and the Prospitian Monarch. The phrase "Peregrine Mendicant" is very similar in meaning to "Foreign Beggar".

   As member of the light kingdom and a Parcel Mistress, PM is sworn to delivering letters. She was first seen by Dream Jade
   . She is formally introduced in Act 4 on the

   Authority Regulator

   carved with the Sburb server disc, which the Authority Regulator also has. She decides that it is her duty to retrieve them both, and so approaches the Authority Regulator in a diplomatic manner. The Authority Regulator finds the Parcel Mistress attractive, but mistakes her for a native of the land. She asks for the packages, but he only relinquishes the

   On the Battlefield, she reaches the White King, who abdicates and gives her his scepter (while the
   Hegemonic Brute
   watches). The Hegemonic Brute then proceeds to punch the Parcel Mistress in the face and knock the scepter from her hands, where it falls into a riverbed. She defends herself to a lethal degree by using her Regisword to decapitate the Hegemonic Brute. She grabs his radio to arrange a meeting with Jack Noir, the Sovereign Slayer.

   Following this, her adviser is brutally murdered, along with all of her other allies, except for WV who was greviously wounded. She then swears vengeance and prototypes herself with WV's ring, transportalizing with his corpse into the troll's Incipisphere, to which Jack Noir has escaped.
Jack Noir displays surprise/fear for the first time, as well as a bit of romantic feelings, while PM seems to be in a deep hate. Noir absconds immediately, and PM looks on, while Serenity pleads PM to help the dying Vagabond. Able to see the trolls and kids at the

The two begin to battle, until Jade interrupts them. Jade attempts multiple times to get the two to stop fighting, but to no avail. Eventually, Jade gets in between the two to force them to stop fighting. This stops Jack from fighting, but PM refuses to back down. She punches Jade in the face and knocks her to the ground. She then slices off Bec Noir's arm, causing him to lose the ring and revert back into Jack Noir. She howls in victory. PM then removes her ring and, together with WV, throws both rings into the Forge to ignite it.

   WV initially met and befriended PM when they crossed paths during their time in exile, and they appeared to become close friends. During their time spent with the Aimless Renegade, it became apparent that WV harbored some level of romantic feelings for her, as he tried to win her over with gifts. After PM found WV injured, PM donned the Queen's ring and teleported him to the meteor crew in a desperate bid to save him, then spent 3 years hunting Jack Noir down in WV's name alongside Serenity. The pair is reunited later in
