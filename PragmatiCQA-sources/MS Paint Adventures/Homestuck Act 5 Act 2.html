She then stops talking with Kanaya, telling her that she will speak to her later.

    Kanaya alleviates Jade's worries, telling her that the equipment that they are setting up will be what helps her with "breeding duties". She then tells Jade about her job as the keeper of the matriorb. Kanaya had feared that she would not be able to complete her job, as
    Earth
    was also chosen as a planet to host Sburb. But then she realized, from finding a key in one of the lower areas of the meteor the trolls are on, that she would be able to hatch the
    Mother Grub
    inside the matriorb inside the meteor, but she has some worries about it. Jade tells her that she would be great at it, since her lusus was once a mother grub, she also has the capability to raise one.

    deploys the cloning apparatus at the top of Jade's house, she comments on the fact that it is very small, and cannot fit babies on there. Kanaya is initially confused, but realizes that Jade thinks that she will be cloning humans with the machine. Kanaya corrects her on this and tells her that what she will be cloning is
    frogs
    .
   </li>
   <li key="e603b97f-0202-4331-b54e-558f19246794">
    Dave finishes deploying the rest of the equipment, and Jade tries to appearify a frog. She succeeds, but the frog is still frozen. Kanaya tells Jade, since she is not familiar with the rules of
    paradox clones
    , that she needs to create a slime imprint for the frog in order to clone it. Jade searches for a new frog and finds one in the forest, promising to catch it later. The result creates the slime imprint for the frog, which then becomes a tadpole. Kanaya tells Jade more about paradox clones- how they are destined to become themselves- and tells her that that is not the goal. The goal is to create as many diverse species of frogs possible. When Jade jokingly asks if she is creating the "ultimate frog", Kanaya tells her that she is right. The reason she is doing this is to create the Genesis Frog, a frog with a specific genetic code.
   </li>
   <li key="a638584c-c1dd-40fa-ac81-e6b49edad011">
    Kanaya tells Jade more about the Genesis Frog, starting with the fact that it is a male. The
    consorts
    all praise and await the creation of the Frog, as do the Prospitians. Dersites, however, hate his existence, and wish to stop his creation. They even go so far as to call him names such as "Speaker of the Vast Joke" or
    Bilious Slick
    , the latter of which the trolls ultimately start calling him, and Jade as well. When Jade asks if the frog has anything to do with the universe they are supposed to create, Kanaya affirms this, but Jade incorrectly assumes that the universe would be created and he would create the planets for it. Kanaya corrects her, telling her that the Genesis Frog
    <i key="5956c991-8ccc-4e64-b000-d0b6e0e464df">
     is

    the created universe.

   <li key="2e03178a-eee5-4553-a5db-6a0424d43a04">
    Kanaya then tells Jade about how she, much like Jade herself, had been awake on Prospit long before the trolls played their session of Sgrub. She then tells her how she wound up waking up on Prospit. At a young age Kanaya often had trouble sleeping, and would go out into the desert. One day a
    stranger who dressed and spoke in white
    found her and put her to sleep, which allowed her to awaken on Prospit. She tells Jade that her guardian is the person that Rose has been speaking to, and that anything that he has planned with her cannot be good. Jade assures Kanaya that she will tell her what happens to Rose when she blacks out of view. Jade then decides to implement the password system, and is annoyed when Kanaya suggests the idea came from her future self, preferring to come up with it on her own rather than through stable time loops; which demonstrates why she wants the password system. She tells Kanaya the first password. Kanaya then leaves to hatch the matriorb.

      Karkat then speaks to Feferi and Sollux about Gamzee, as he is worried about him. Neither of them know where he is, so Karkat tells them to stay in the lab. Karkat then speaks to Kanaya about Jade and her password system, but he realizes that even though future Jade is annoying him with the password system, he really sees her as a friend. Kanaya asks Karkat if Terezi is aware of his contact with Jade. He tells her that she probably isn't, but even if she did she has no right to be upset, since she is speaking with

      As Kanaya is about to
      transportalize
      from the lab, Eridan transportalizes in, knocking her away. He talks to Kanaya, and thanks her for making his wand. He asks her where she's going, and she tells him about hatching the matriorb. Eridan, thinking that there was no more hope left, decides to become involved in this process, and asks Kanaya to wait for him. When he talks with Karkat he recalls his time on the
      Land of Wrath and Angels
      , and asks Karkat why no one wanted to travel with him there. Karkat tells him that no one wanted to hang out with him because he is a jerk to everyone, and because he was attacking the angels in his land constantly, who weren't supposed to be attacked and were attacking him in the process. Karkat then tells him to stay in the lab. Eridan goes up to Feferi and Sollux and asks to speak to Feferi. She tells him that she knows that he is trying to force the two out of their matespritship into an
      auspisticism
      one by constantly dueling Sollux. Eridan denies this outright and asks Feferi to go with him to find
      Jack Noir
      . Feferi and Sollux think that he is going to try to fight Noir, and she tries to get him to stop. Eridan tells her that it would be insane to fight Noir, and is instead going to join him. Feferi thinks he is a coward for this, and Eridan tells her that as the
      Prince of Hope
      , he can see that there is no more hope for them, and he wants to go to Jack to see if he could spare him, and wants Feferi to come along. Feferi and Sollux decide that they have to stop him, as trying to find Noir could lead him to their hideout on the meteor. Eridan and Sollux then begin Round Two of their

    lipstick
    , while Eridan faces her with his wand ready. Eridan destroys the matriorb (ruining any hope the trolls have of repopulation) and kills Kanaya in short order. Eridan then absconds, leaving Karkat to gawp in utter disbelief at the situation.

    fluctuating between all lowercase and all caps

He says that he is going to try to revive Feferi and Kanaya, but can't bring himself to approach the horn pile, afraid that Gamzee will be there. When past Feferi answers the memo he says that he is sorry and bans her too. He also warns the others that Eridan is also killing people, and to stay away from him as well, but says that if he sees him he's going to kill him. Past Eridan then responds to the memo, chiding Karkat for believing in the use of wands. Karkat tells Eridan to forget about their "pact", something that Eridan does not know about. Karkat does not care, however, and says that he hates all instances of Eridan for what he did to Kanaya. Eridan thinks that Karkat is hitting on him, and Karkat has to keep telling him that he isn't. Before he bans Eridan, Karkat tells him that he is going to kill him. Future Gamzee then responds to the memo, telling Karkat that he knows where he is and what he's going to do, and suggests that they all sit down and talk. Karkat freaks out and closes the memo.

    Meanwhile, Terezi finds Tavros's corpse and begins a crime scene investigation roleplay to determine the killer, even though she has no doubt that Vriska is to blame. During the roleplay, she hears Gamzee honking in the distance, but believes that he's simply fooling around. She then prepares to revive Tavros by kissing him, looking very much disgusted in the process. Meanwhile (which is to say, in the past) Karkat does the same with Kanaya.

    spitting it out
    , then eating it some more. In an effort to save time, John ejects all the contents from the captchalogue cards and views their contents, which include a pile of pipes, a pile of razor blades, a spare car, shoes, hats, ties, issues of The Serious Jester, ticket stubs from a Cirque du Soleil show (a memory John does not want to recall), a briefcase, pictures, a
    laptop

    frogs
    (the involvement of which with her repopulating mission she's still unaware of at this moment); the conversation then switches to Jade's much lamented dream self prototyping and John's ascent to god tier, then to WV? being in possession of the
    Queen's Ring
    (John deciding to trust him with it, believing he and the ring share a common fate), and then finally to Dad's whereabouts. Jade finds out where Dad is located using her Spectagoggles, and informs John he's currently in a castle somewhere on the planet's surface, having "some sort of tea party" with

Karkat checks on Sollux and notices his teeth fell out during the fall, so he tries to put them back into his mouth to hide the fact that he dropped him, with really poor results. He then trolls

She explains how they adventured together, with her trying to make him strong, but he never got it, and when he finally decided to be strong and confront her, it was too late so she killed him in anger. She tells John that he's the only person she can speak to about how she feels, since speaking to any of the trolls about it might make them think she's weak. She says that she feels horrible for it, but she doesn't know why, since on
    her planet
    she would be congratulated for it. John thinks that this is the first time Vriska has killed anyone, but she corrects him: it's the first time she killed someone she cared about. She talks about her life before Sgrub, where she killed thousands of trolls in order to feed her lusus, and then she remembers that she killed

Vriska thinks that the game knows that children are going to be playing and gives them challenges that would make them grow up, and she says that's the reason their game split them up into two teams, because it knew that their culture was violent and they would start killing each other. She theorizes that they probably would have all made the god tiers. She then blames
    Karkat
    for their success and why they didn't kill each other, saying that he was too good a leader, and that his constant need to be one and to keep everyone working together was why they won.

John isn't sure he wants Vriska fighting Noir by herself, and reminds her that they have a plan. Vriska wonders if she truly does have all the luck, and that knowing that there's no risk to something means that there's no bravery behind it. She brings up something from earlier in their conversation, where she said that she did not relate to John's attachment to his father, and says that she lied. She has no attachment to her
    custodian

    Marquise Spinneret Mindfang

    class
    . Inside of the chest were Mindfang's journals, which document her time leading a group known as the Gamblignants. Vriska became how she is by reading them, and also found her
    Fluorite Octet
    during her
    RP
    days because of the notes Mindfang left behind. Vriska tells John that in addition to the twelve trolls, Karkat also created an additional twelve grubs, who all became their ancestors. John relates to her story by telling her that his
    Nanna
    was someone he never actually met, but based his life off of her, who based her life off of

He asks if Terezi has any tips for being blind, but she is unsure of her ability as a teacher. When Sollux assures her that she'll be fine, she decides to do it and asks where they are.

    , which he later uses to alchemize a new hammer. She also tells John that he has to kiss Rose and bring her dream self back to life in order for the backup plan to defeat Jack to work, and also expresses her wish to go on a date with John someday. After apologizing for not telling him about
    his father
    , she leaves to deal with Terezi. Vriska is indeed right, as John comes back to life in a burst of color, as the readers knew he would.

    John tries to message Vriska back, and is met with Karkat, who tells him to get out of the blackness and to the Beat Mesa LOHAC. Once he does so, Karkat tries to give him a concise summary of recent events, since the critical moment is apparently approaching. It's clear that he's rather upset, as he has just dealt with Gamzee, once his best friend, that honor now taken by John. However, when John asks what he did next, he sidesteps the issue, saying it's a troll thing. John then asks Karkat if Rose is okay.

    Karkat confirms that John kissing Rose's corpse did indeed revive Rose's dream self. He briefly wonders if it would have worked on his
    Dad
    or
    Mom
    , but both Karkat and John become disgusted at the notion briefly after thinking it through and drop the thought completely; Karkat reflects a bit on his crab lusus dying in an attempt to cheer John up. They then return to the subject of Rose, who awaits
    The Tumor
    on
    Derse
    . They then talk about Jade's plan, which involves Dave abusing time travel to speed up the frog-breeding process (as we have seen happen in the narrow fenestrated wall). Karkat informs John that they ran into
    Bec Noir
    , and that Dave died as a result. Jade kissed Dave's corpse, and dream Dave then revived on Derse near Rose.

    The Signless's story is told. He was never given a sign because of his mutant blood, so he was forced to wander the world for several sweeps to avoid being culled. However, possibly because of his genetic defect, he began having visions of the old, peaceful troll planet, and swore to restore those old ways through teachings of compassion and equality among all. However, the
    highbloods
    began noticing, and a sectarian war followed, which ended with the Sufferer's capture. With his torture, his quiet compassion became burning rage at his treatment, and when he finally died, he yelled the Vast Expletive, which held the summation of his teachings for all who would accept its burden. Later, after his body was cremated, the irons he was held in became his symbol, as the few who still believed in his preachings (one being
    Redglare
    ) began re-appropriating them as such. Eventually, as the Sufferer had prophesied,
    another of his lineage
    would become the second Signless, heralding the apocalypse and glory beyond Alternia.

She would become a savage and a nun, writing the scriptures from memory with the blood of slain animals, for posterity to read. Unfortunately, the Dolorosa would be sold to slavery, possibly becoming

    the Summoner
    's, which she would defuse afterwards by banishing all adults from Alternia. However, as she grew distant from Gl'bgolyb, so too did their bond weaken, until the lusus chose to ally itself with
