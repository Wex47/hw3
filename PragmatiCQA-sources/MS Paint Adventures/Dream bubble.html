   It seems that dream bubbles can be put to more unusual purposes. Smaller, miniature bubbles can be used to store memories. Dave has used these as a replacement for the Internet, creating a parody of a
   that he calls dave_ebubbles. It regurgitates everything he's said over the course of the adventure. There is a real equivalent on Twitter, which can be visited

   have set up a method of communication for the inhabitants of each dream bubble: a social network called Bubblr where players can "rebubble" memories to a potential audience of everyone in the afterlife, edit their memories before they send it to Bubblr, follow other players, or leave comments on memories. The memories that players can send out apparently stem from their souls, and Bubblr has many other ties to each player's soul.

   According to

If everyone in the afterlife follows any given player through Bubblr, that player will come back to life. Conversely, if a player ever has zero followers, their soul dies forever.

   Several dream bubbles seen so far have had a planet at their center. This may be true for all dream bubbles, but that is unknown as only a few have had their interiors shown zoomed out enough.

   Memory objects in dream bubbles have so far shown little to no difference with their real counterparts. The memory version of the
   Pop-a-matic Vrillyhoo Hammer
   worked exactly the same as the real hammer likely would. A hat created by a roll of that hammer left the bubble temporarily, but may have fallen back into the bubble because it is tied to the bubble. The reason is still uncertain, and probably irrelevant.

   A conversation between Vriska and the instance of John slain by Typheus implies that the presence of formely-living entities (in this example John's dad, whose state of life in the doomed timeline was not shown) that are not directly tied with a specific session, even players whose instances in the corresponding universe have been assigned the role of ancestors, are merely illusions - their souls will not be taken into the dream bubbles upon their demise and no other places of afterlife have been seen, although Aradia did summon the souls of Vriska's victims to torment her in retribution for crippling Tavros.

   It is hard, as such, to determine how real memories can become, i.e., if Equius' memory of Aurthour is actually Aurthour's soul, or just a very interactable representation (as is only guessable with the two other lusii seen in the bubbles (Crabdad and Sollux/Mituna's Lusus)). Rufioh also expresses uncertainty as to whether the instance of his lusus rescued by Horuss is just a memory-based construct.

   Jack Noir
   also affected a dream bubble, but he physically entered it rather than dreaming in it. If carapacians indeed dream in the bubbles, this could explain how Vriska could enter

   This could also imply that other constructs of Sburb/Sgrub appear in dream bubbles. This means that Leprachauns may also be able to dream in the bubbles. It may also suggest, if they are further explored, that other Carapacians may appear in the bubbles, such as Snowman and other various dead exiles.

   It may also act as a resting place for "dead" sprites - the Lusussprites and the sprites of the original twelve trolls.
