   If the player chooses to follow her, Tirona leads them to her office. After exchanging pleasantries and clearing the player of all criminal charges, Tirona states that she would like the player to help her break into other trolls' office so that she may find incriminating evidence. Despite the player's reluctance to turn on their friends, they comply because Tirona had freed them from prison earlier. Should the player suggest breaking into

The player lies that they're looking for relevant information on Tyzias, even though they're actually letting Tyzias know that someone intends to break into her office. The player eventually gets past the security system, and Tirona wastes no time rifling through all of Tyzias' documents. When her search goes nowhere, Tirona loses her temper, invoking the player's sympathy. Just as the player is done reassuring Tirona, Tyzias enters the room and bluntly tells Tirona to get lost. Dragging the player to the furthest corner of the office, Tyzias thanks the player for the text and chats with them for a bit. Tyzias then allows the player to leave so that she may begin reorganizing her scattered belongings, and Tirona is astounded that the player is still alive. This leads Tirona to believe that being companions with the player is a worthwhile decision.

   Tirona is a young troll eager to prove herself useful for the Empire, and would go out of her way do make herself useful for
   Trizza's
   cause. This is made evident when she outright states that her main job is to spread memes so as to create support for the heiress, and has a troll well-versed with technology to man the fake Chittr accounts she'd created just for the sake of disseminating propaganda. She is fairly confident that her efforts with "Memeaganda" will someday be recognized by her superiors, which also means that she can get some bonus allegiance points. Her main desire is to work alongside His Honourable Tyranny, believing that being sent out to apprehend criminals is far dangerous than the off-chance of being eaten by the monstrous judge.
  </p>
  <p key="91c904a3-79ac-41e5-b679-1335369b8e9e">
   While she might be competent at her job, there are times where Tirona can come off as immature. For one thing, she believes that ratting someone out as a rebel spy is a perfect way to get a one-up on the others, since she's quite desperate to prove herself superior to the other teals. When she is unable to find anything particularly incriminating in Tyzias' office, she flies into a frustrated rage and thoughtlessly rumages through all the documents in the hopes of finding something useful. It should be noted that most of her infuriation stems from the fact that she's young and not at all inclined towards violence, meaning that being knowledgeable is the only thing she has as leverage against her fellow teals.
  </p>
  <p key="ffb9e90d-e40a-4a2b-9c1a-ee14dac078b0">
   Despite her shifty inclinations, Tirona is a friendly character and chats amiably with the player throughout the route. She only becomes exasperated with the player when they decide to mess with their phone instead of breaking into Tyzias' office. However, Tirona is prone to abandoning the player when things go wrong: when the player accidentally accepts a call from Tagora, Tirona high-tails it out of the office instantly; when Tyzias catches the player and Tirona in the office, Tirona flees the room right after Tyzias bluntly tells her to hit the road.

   Tirona doesn't appear to like her fellow teals by much, since she yearns to prove that she's better than the lot of them. All this is done for the sake of being able to work with His Honourable Tyranny in the future, and Tirona's more than willing to use dirty tricks to sabotage others.

   Tirona is outright fearful of Tyzias, since the latter is surrounded by frightening (but untrue) rumours. When Tyzias orders Tirona to get out, the younger teal darts out of the room without a word, eyes wide and filled with terror. After the player emerges unharmed from Tyzias' office, Tirona is surprised that they're still alive.

   Tirona appears to have what she sees as a fairly good relationship with her unnamed contact, likely
   Doc Scratch
   , as she speaks fondly of them when mentioning them to the player. According to Tirona, said troll often sends her to run errands, and lavishes her with praise when the task is completed. As such, it can be inferred that the two are in her eyes friends to some degree.
