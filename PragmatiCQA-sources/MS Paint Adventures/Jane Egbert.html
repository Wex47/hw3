   While initially introduced as John's grandmother, Jane is actually a
   paradox clone
   of herself sent back in time as an infant from the present. Her DNA is combined with
   Jake Harley
   's DNA through
   Ectobiology
   to create the paradox clones of

   </a>
   . This action creates a
   CAUSAL LOOP
   in which case, John creates both Jane and himself from the present and sends the clones as infants to the past.
  </p>
  <p key="9cafd73a-f944-486b-abee-83e84609b75a">
   After being sent to Earth on a meteor during
   The Reckoning
   , Jane was adopted by
   Colonel Sassacre
   and
   Betty Crocker
   . Eight days later, however, another meteor hit, this time transporting Jake Harley from

   . Jake accidentally shot the Colonel, killing him. He then became Jane's adoptive brother.
  </p>
  <p key="fea7b09a-c105-418d-993e-4625b83d6c1a">
   At the age of 13, Jake developed a taste for adventure and took off with
   Halley
   , leaving Jane to stay with Betty Crocker. Afterwards Crocker taught Jane the art of baking, which she took with determination, hoping to one day surpass her evil mentor. When one day Jane mentioned the departed Jake again, the baroness told her of her true origins and told her that she was determined to keep the two apart, since they were destined to be married and produce a pair of children who would save the world. After this, she began to construct a plan to topple Crocker's pastry empire. During this time Jane learned many of Crocker's secrets, including the fact that she was not human. However, one day the Batterwitch vanished without a trace. Her pastry empire was bequeathed not to Jane, but to Jake.
  </p>
  <p key="7ebbbe69-d5af-44a9-952e-7841c149bfe1">
   Jane was, in fact, relieved by this news, as it meant that she could pursue her passion for practical japery she inherited from Colonel Sassacre. She decided against searching for Jake, and instead married a fine, upstanding gentleman who would be

   's father. She opened a store called the Prankster's Gambit, probably in honor of Colonel Sassacre.
  </p>
  <p key="f4bdf4d3-08db-4148-92cd-ce4b5c904475">
   John was told that her tragic death involved a bookshelf, a ladder, and an unabridged edition of
   Colonel Sassacre's Daunting Text of Magical Frivolity and Practical Japery
   . However, she was actually killed by the meteor carrying baby John from

   . Her remains rest on top of the mantle within a
   Sacred Urn
   until John's antics knock it over during the game of

   </a>
   . After the ashes are hastily put back into the urn, they are later showered upon John's
   Kernelsprite
   when her urn is toppled again following the
   of Colonel Sassacre's text. The sprite absorbs her memory and personality, though they merge with the qualities of the
   harlequin doll
   which had been previously prototyped, giving her a mangled face, a
   fake arm
   and a Harlequin outfit. It is also possible that this increased her already present tendency towards jappery and pranks.

  <p key="e7a7803f-97d4-412d-aa9d-6b8f26bf9119">
   As both a sprite and a trickster, Jane evaded John for a period of time. She reveals herself through the classic bucket on top of the door trick, increasing her
   Prankster's Gambit
   . Her conversations are shown through the Sprite Log, where she is referred to as "Nannasprite."
  </p>
  <p key="621dd6bd-7712-4fe5-b4dc-3990ecd3b9f8">
   Nannasprite retains her memories and personality as a sprite and helps John by providing needed exposition on where Sburb sent him and the whereabouts of his
   <a href="Dad.html" key="47201201-0ada-4bbb-a1b5-85fb8f239bba" title="Dad">
    Dad
   </a>
   . Whether Nannasprite knew of
   The Medium
   before her death is unknown, but a good portion of her knowledge is given to all sprites. Nannasprite also retains all her old skills as a sprite, creating so many cookies that it is surprising that there is enough room to store them all. She is also granted special powers; her scarred eye launches attacks, such as lasers, while her intact eye offers aid through various means, such as healing lasers. Both eyes are capable of conjuring furniture and kitchen appliances, which glow the same blue light as her lasers and herself, the purpose of which depends on the eye used. However, an oven created by her intact eye with the purpose of catching and launching John was later used to offensively launch a cookie-infused laser at a
   Crude Ogre
   , though it's possible this was a completely different oven created by her scarred eye. She also appears to leave a blue goo (ectoplasm) behind as she phases through walls.

   new location

   She was left behind at John's house when John reached his
   first gate
   and instead continued advising him from a distance, informing him that he is the
   Heir of Breath
   . John unlocked the ability to have Nannasprite accompany him, receiving a special pendant, but quickly lost it in a sea of oil. Nannasprite was responsible for laundering the robes of the secret wizard and indirectly caused the proliferation of the highly silly Secret Wizard cult.

  <p key="ef743ed8-8290-4b1c-952f-a3cbccef8045">
   She eventually made her way to
   Skaia
   , as the notion seems to be programmed into Sprites. There she found the wreckage of Dad's car and Dad's
   . She retrieved the PDA, and contacted
   fedorafreak
   on Dad's
   Serious Business
   program. She told him the story of her childhood, phrasing it as a fairy tale.

   Fourth wall
   . Proof of Nannasprite's continued existence can be seen on

   GAME OVER
   and was transported to the new timeline on

   early in the three-year journey, Nannasprite was alive through the three year journey; Jade mentioned that she baked a lot of cake in an attempt to cheer her up. Because both the native post-retcon Nannasprite and the version from Game Over survived, the new timeline ended up with two copies of her.

   Jane is passionate about practical jokes and pranks, with John being her new favorite target. Despite this she also manages to be very maternal and caring towards John. As a sprite she is also in the know on plenty of information about Sburb. However, she has to remain coy and cryptic about it, much to her delight and John's chagrin. As evidenced by Nannasprite, Jane is a baking aficionado much like her son, having learned the trade from none other than Betty Crocker herself. She prefers cookies over cakes however, and this undoubtedly caused much
   Strife
   between them.

   She was very close to him and they shared a love for practical jokes (out of defiance towards the Batterwitch). While they were living with
   Betty Crocker
   , they promised that one day they would run away together. At the age of 13, Jake developed a taste for adventure and took off with Halley. He asked Jane if she would come along, but she was too scared of the baroness, so he left her behind. Before leaving, he reassures her that he believes in her. Jane missed Jake and followed his achievements in the newspapers. She also often fantasized about rejoining him. Years later, when Jane mentioned Jake to the baroness, she told her that she was determined to keep the two apart, since they were destined to be married and produce a pair of children who would save the world.
