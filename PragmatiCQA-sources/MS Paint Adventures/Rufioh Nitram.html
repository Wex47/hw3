   Much like his dancestor Tavros, Rufioh is a fan of Fiduspawn. According to Meenah, he was born with his wings (or rather, sprouted them upon 'puperty' [sic] i.e. pupation.) Rufioh calls himself a

   for it, and according to Aranea, he was an outcast due to it as well. For these reasons, Rufioh admits that he does not have high self-esteem, or not nearly as high as those around him think he does. To avoid the unwanted and negative attention, he went to live in the wooden village, with tree huts and rope ladders, with people who would accept him, known as the "Lost Weeaboos". Or as Rufioh put it, he followed his
   lusus
   into the woods instead, where he met
   Damara
   and presumably
   Horuss
   as well.

   He was romantically linked with Damara, as well as Horuss at the same time (albeit in secret). Finally, Rufioh broke off the matespritship with Damara, who eventually turned to tormenting him. Rufioh mentions to Meenah one instance in his matespritship with Damara where she left him unable to walk or move, and was so injured that Horuss had to build him a temporary mechanical body (shaped like a horse). This is a callback to Equius stating he wanted to give Tavros a

   Horuss
   because of the reaction he may get. It is noteworthy, however, that he is able to tell Damara that she won't get another chance with him. It is also suggested that he's a pushover of sorts, and has a hard time saying no. He admits to being somewhat cowardly, as he often avoids conflicts of the emotional or physical kind. He can also be seflish, as he had a red relationship with Horuss while being Damara's matesprit, he then also flirts with an Aradiabot while Horuss is near by.
