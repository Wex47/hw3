   . Starting in August 2019, Hussie began posting pictures of himself dressed in esoteric outfits in a variety of locations, parodying the style of the so-called eBoy/eGirl subculture, a partially-ironic internet subculture popularized on social media apps and associated with an alternative/goth aesthetic. The account seems to be a parody of instagram influencers who adopt this style.

  <p key="3170a64b-c6f8-453c-ac8f-0c5d9a4ae9b2">
   Andrew Hussie's Toblerone was originally a meme/joke dating from the early days of MS Paint Adventures. An old photograph of Hussie depicts him standing outside a cave holding a Toblerone; the image is helpfully labelled, with the Toblerone highlighted, and the cave indicated to be a "MOTHER FUCKIN CAVE". This image became mildly famous among early fans, and was occasionally referenced in fanworks and discussions of fan lore.
  </p>
  <p key="d5556df1-c573-48bf-97fe-4d1ccd399016">
   The initial Toblerone hunt seems to have been a direct reference to this image. The first hunt commenced on August 25 with three image sets; the first, a still image of Hussie sitting on a wall. The second contained pictures of a box of Toblerones, all signed with Hussie's name and numbered, as well as a location by a brick wall where they were hidden, and a screenshot of a google maps page of the location of the Toblerone box. The third image set contained images of Hussie standing with a Toblerone in front of and inside the original Toblerone cave from the original "Hussie with Toblerone" image.
  </p>
  <p key="19dcc211-6240-4dd2-b38a-b4b24d1340c5">
   No more than a day later, twitter user @placeholder4abn posted a
   of them uncovering the horde of signed Toblerones. The location of the Toblerones and the original images seems to have been in
   Point Lobos
   in California.
  </p>
  <p key="a71b49d7-8c9f-47c3-b66c-e383dec18971">
   On October 11, 2019, Hussie posted images recording the location of a second package of numbered Toblerones, seemingly during a trip to Taiwan. This time, the indicated location of the Toblerones was at the A-MEI Teahouse in Taiwan. Once more, these were quickly located by a fan on twitter, user @_Abyss_Dream, who posted
   of them recovering some of the Toblerones and leaving others behind.
  </p>
  <p key="fb65b1da-1944-4ceb-bada-0e0eb5bdb416">
   After a shorter time lapse than previously, Hussie released the third set of Toblerone images on October 17, 2019. This images set included a picture of numerous signed sketches of Homestuck characters, presumably hidden alongside the new batch of numbered Toblerones. The indicated location appears to be a small artificial island in Banpo Hangan Park, Seoul, South Korea. This was followed several hours later by another set of images, and a message that he had forgotten

   horns in the original set of sketches. To rectify this, the new set of images detailed the location of a drawing of the horns (and only the horns), to be placed in a Starbucks in the Gangnam district of Seoul for "half an hour only".
  </p>
  <p key="289601d9-6dc2-4350-bb89-a3572e644f5a">
   By the next day, the first stash of Toblerones and sketches had apparently been claimed by a number of fans, with twitter user @D4vepet4
   , although claiming that they had been late to arrive to the impromptu gathering at the drop location. Because of this, the first person to discover the Toblerones and drawings is unclear.

   After the first Toblerone hauls were located by fans on Twitter, Hussie jokingly agreed to grant the users "requests" relating to the Homestuck canon. This originally stemmed from a twitter user joking that finding the Toblerones made @placeholder4abn the "new Homestuck author". Continuing the joke, @placeholder4abn responded by issuing a "decree", to which Hussie himself unexpectedly responded in the affirmative.

  <p key="802fd027-4f0f-403f-a0e2-6772e3f7a5d3">
   The first "reward" granted was the (nominal) canonization of a fan interpretation of

   The initial "

   was "you were the first to find my treasure, and so it will be done".
  </p>
  <p key="a5a72be8-695f-4852-b232-2bc5de3084b7">
   The implications of this response are unclear; many fans have taken it as explicit

    canonization

   . Even prior to the tweet, according to Hiveswap Friendsim writer Aysha U. Farah, Hussie had stated that June Egbert was "the only headcanon that she'd seen Hussie get excited about", during
   of the Perfectly Generic Podcast at about 32:43. Moreover, the ending of
   Pesterquest: Volume 4
   features an image of John getting their fingernails painted by

  <p key="7c2d4e3a-4731-4855-95a4-74f7f17113f3">
   However, the
   canonicity
   of June Egbert is still questionable, as this depiction of the character has not explicitly appeared in any published Homestuck works, canonical or otherwise. It has been noted by some that Hussie has previously declared things canon to little or no consequences, such as his famous declaration that
   all fan trolls were canon
   .
