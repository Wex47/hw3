   <i key="d183bab7-c3cb-416e-be22-249615461501">

   comes from this concept. Typically a fairly simple goal is to be achieved, and due to the increasingly evolving weird puzzle shit, the game becomes more and more complicated. Weird puzzle shit often takes "Hundreds of Pages" to solve, and weird puzzle shit occurs so often cheat codes are typed in to skip really long and boring parts of the game.

   , as it takes a deviation from typical weird puzzle shit and goes with a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure instead.

   Weird puzzle shit also alludes to a slight breaking of the fourth wall. A good example of this is when
   <a href="Problem Sleuth (character).html" key="80915566-208d-4ca7-a2a0-2453898bbf02" title="Problem Sleuth (character)">
    Problem Sleuth

   </a>
   on the phone that he's
   and promptly hangs up. This statement may indicate that Problem Sleuth has a half-conscious awareness that his entire existence consists of and is centered around weird puzzle shit. Oddly enough,
   <a href="Hysterical Dame.html" key="9d56d84d-4cda-4af1-afc9-a5d8ecd6ef3a" title="Hysterical Dame">
    Hysterical Dame
   </a>
   sympathizes with his need to address the weird puzzle shit, possibly understanding what it is that he's talking about, or she just may have thought that while being in one of her slight fits of

   Weird puzzle shit is phrased repeatedly in a manner similar to -

   is a variance of weird puzzle shit. It refers to hidden motifs and other glaringly obvious inclusions, intrusions, and other repetitive themes into the game that occur frequently.
