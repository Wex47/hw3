   to be prototyped, much like the
   Queen's Ring
   . Unlike the Rings, however, the Scepters also bestow upon their wielder a dramatic increase in size. Each scepter is tipped with a representation of
   Skaia
   . The scepter, also similar to the queen's rings, has orbs floating around the base of the tip. The number of orbs is directly correlated with the number of prototypings in a given session (four in the beta kids' Sburb session, 12 in the beta trolls' Sgrub session and zero in the alpha kids' Sburb session).

   The
   Flash animation features two scene transitions suggesting that the scepters may, in fact, hold Skaia itself. It is unclear whether this was literal or artistic; however, the former is implied by the

   The White King, like the
   White Queen
   , had chosen to abdicate, turning his scepter over to the
   Parcel Mistress
   . Unfortunately, the Parcel Mistress lost it, as it was knocked out of her hand by the
   Hegemonic Brute
   . The Scepter flew over a waterfall and landed in a riverbed.

   The scepter was later retrieved by the
   Courtyard Droll
   and handed to
   Jack Noir
   . He used it to begin
   The Reckoning
   , an act that the Black King would perform upon defeating the white army in a typical Sburb session. It appears that the scepter was discarded (or perhaps destroyed) afterward, as it has not been seen since.

   The Black King's Scepter was cut in half by Jack Noir during his assault on the Black King. It is presumably now unusable, but knowing the unpredictable nature of the game this is just a theory. Interestingly, the half held by the Black King had its size reduced back to proper scale, but the half that fell to the ground remained the same size as when it was fully functional.

   Strangely enough, the White King's scepter in the post-

   Void session
   ). It also seems to have no effect on her size, though that could be because - like the Queen's Ring - it lacks any orbs.

   . The significance of this is unknown. It also exhibits
   Weapon/Object Duality
