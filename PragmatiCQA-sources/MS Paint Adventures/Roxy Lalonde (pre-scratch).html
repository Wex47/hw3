   Having been created through ectobiology, she landed on Earth via a meteor and was presumably adopted into an unknown family. Given that in the Lab next to her house there is furniture that resembles a little girl's room, it is possible she grew up in the Lab. This possibility has been supported by author comentary by Andrew Hussie in the Homestuck books, where he also put forward that it was likely that Mom actually grew up under a younger Jake Harley, or that he outsourced her upbringing but was involved with it. This is further supported by the events

   She is likely either an astronomer, or astrologist, as she is an expert in celestial phenomena. Her house contains a giant telescope to aid in her work, regardless. She was either employed by, or requested to study a phenomena for Jake Harley, most likely the unusual meteorite impacts connected to Sburb. Strengthening this connection to Jake Harley is the fact that she seem to be involved with Jake Harley's company Skaianet. Her house was immediately next to a giant

   It can be assumed that Roxy Lalonde is quite wealthy as she can afford to live in an architectural marvel of a house and had a twenty foot tall granite statue lowered into her house for the sole purpose of decoration.

   She seems to possess a tense relationship with her daughter and is intially seen as being unsupportive of her, either being completely oblivious to her daughter's interests or aware of them but giving Rose gifts that she hates on purpose. Rose believes her mother is constantly making her life miserable through cruel irony. Rose's mother held a funeral for

   when Rose was young, a fine example of the mysterious cruel irony that Rose holds so much anger against. However, the funeral might have been misunderstanding, as she has been speculated to have more empathy for her daughter than she lets on. If this is true, all of the guardians might be well-meaning but misunderstood, both antagonizing their children and protecting them, though they all clearly have their missteps as parent figures. It also should be noted that she went on a meteor with Mutie; if the cat survived, it'd become Roxy's's pet, and she would develop a liking for cats, showing that her "absurd" funeral was actually Mom making light of the absurdity of death, much like Hussie throughout the comic, which could have possibly fueled her daughter's dark sense of humor.

   , while Roxy enjoys classical wizards. Rose is later revealed to have a genuine interest in wizards, and consider her mother's behavior to be a crass mockery. Dave hypothesizes that Roxy is genuinely trying to connect with her daughter, just like how Rose believes John's Dad's fascination with harlequins (a clown looking manaquin) is an attempt to bond with his own child, but Rose refuses to believe it.

   When one considers her post-scratch's self genuine love of wizards and cats, her mockery and sarcasm could be seen as her secretly expressing love for these things under layers of irony, rather than being an attempt to spite Rose alone. As Dave's mother, this isn't much of a stretch. In summary, one might speculate that her ironic mockery and cruelty towards Rose was not always intended or was sometimes meant to be funny or ironic. Some may claim that these expressed interests were genuine attempts to share things she loved with her daughter. Definitive conclusions cannot be made, as Mom never speaks or explains herself, so all we see of her is through Rose's eyes. Various descriptions of her in
