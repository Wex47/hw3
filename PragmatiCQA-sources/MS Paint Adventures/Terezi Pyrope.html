   The name Terezi was first proposed by
   , and Pyrope was suggested by
   . Terezi is the Albanian, Azerbaijani, Turkish and Ukranian word (coming from Persian
   ترازو
   ) for Libra (or Balance), but may also be a reference to Teiresias, a blind prophet from Sophocles'
   <i key="8066a5d7-f040-4545-8445-aba2becb8674">
    Oedipus
   </i>
   cycle, and Homer's
   <i key="079ca596-b526-412e-ae36-533f87d73619">
    Odyssey
   </i>
   . Teiresias has both been male and female; her ambiguous sprite might be an allusion to this. Her name may also be a reference to
   Denny Teresi
   , who is blind. Her last name, Pyrope, is a type of
   red garnet
   . This is most likely a reference to her red spectacles as well as her burnt red eyes, especially given that "Pyrope" derives from Greek "fire" and "eyes", and Pyrope is the scientific species name of the
   Fire-eyed Diucon
   .
   Pyralspite
   similarly shares her red, glowing eyes. Pyralspite is also the name for the
   subgroup of garnets
   that includes pyrope.
  </p>
  <p key="4a92c2b8-e77b-4c81-bd8a-b4b0d7f311e0">
   Terezi is shown to have a fondness for dragons (especially their colorful scales) and owns several
   scalemates
   . Scales are a pun on Libra, and her fondness for justice is also related to Libra. They may also be a pun on 'Draconian Law'. The fact that she is blind, is fond of justice and has the zodiac Libra makes her
   to
   Lady Justice
   , who is depicted as blind, and carrying a pair of scales.

   , refers to her being the troll which "calibrates" all of the other trolls and keeps them focused on the tasks at hand (it also has her zodiac sign, "Libra", in it). Another theory is that she is the one who, literally or figuratively, calibrates the gallows where wrongdoers are hanged, referencing her desire for justice, order, and law; as well as her fervent beliefs that breakers of those laws must be punished with due severity.

   Upon first meeting Aranea, the two got along quite well with Terezi stating the two of them would have become good friends if they had known each other. Aranea offered to heal Terezi and restore her sight, which she gratefully denied. Later on Terezi changed her mind though and let Aranea heal her. This apparently contributed to Terezi's depression. After meeting in LOFAF, Terezi is extremely angry at Aranea, claiming that she talked her into restoring her eye-sight and that Aranea and Gamzee manipulated her together.

   Terezi was not raised by her Lusus, as it had not yet hatched. When it hatched, the Doomsday Scale would tip and begin counting down to the end of their world.

   The doomsday button bears a spirograph, as featured in Sburb.

   Her custodian is a dragon—fitting since dragons have scales. After the start of the game, Terezi hatched the egg as the world was ending anyway. Unfortunately, the lusus was killed by a meteor immediately after hatching. Terezi eventually prototyped her sprite with the corpse.

   After Terezi lost her sight, it was her Lusus, through communication during her sleep during the daytime, that helped teach her the skills to function without vision, by smelling and tasting her surroundings, much like the dragon. The species apparently is born without sight and must learn to function that way themselves.

   Her Lusus also appears to have the ability to control Terezi in her sleep, as shown in
   . Upon being prototyped, her Lusus does little more than greet or bade her farewell, and giggle insanely.
