   , and their job is to oppose the players- they do not assist the
   Dersite army
   on
   the Battlefield
   - indeed,
   Wayward Vagabond
   , a Dersite soldier, was not even familiar with the term "Imp" post-exile. Unlike most
   Prospitians
   and
   Dersites
   , they are physically affected by pre-entry
   prototypings
   , though unlike the kings and queens (and
   Jack Noir
   ), they usually don't take on the attributes of all of them. When killed, Underlings explode into piles of
   grist
   , sometimes also leaving behind
   vitality gel
   cubes and / or additional remains, such as stains (as seen with shale imps and tar basilisks) or
   . Each underling is associated with and named after a specific type of
   grist
   , and drops that type of grist when killed, although they can also drop additional varieties of grist. It can be postulated based on the contents of the Act 6 Act 4 Flash that Underlings encountered in
   void sessions
   are skeletal.
   the skeletal Underlings of void sessions are very difficult to permanently kill, collapsing into piles of bones before reassembling and attacking again.

   . There is one unknown type of underling that is seen as one of
   Grandpa
   's game trophies. Three large, unnamed underlings are seen in
   , including a horned underling of the same type seen by Grandpa's fireplace. Another unknown underling, noted for having an extremely long body, is seen behind
   Terezi
   ; this is confirmed to be a separate underling type (rather than the length being a result of one of the trolls' prototypings) by the existence of a skeletal equivalent
   .
