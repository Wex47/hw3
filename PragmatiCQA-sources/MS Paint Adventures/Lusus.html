   means "freak of nature". In Latin, the plural of "lusus" is "lusÅ«s". In English, "lusus", "lususes", "lusii" and "lusi" have all been used, with lusii being the most common (and also used
   from the Alternia album). Lusii is also what has been used in the

   Trolls and their custodians have a peculiar arrangement of codependency. The lusus behaves as a lifelong bodyguard, caretaker, and visceral sort of mentor, while the young troll must learn to function as a sort of zookeeper. The death of a lusus results in the young troll getting culled.
   They are almost always seen in some variation of

   They are horrifying beasts found in the ceremonial brooding caverns once the young trolls have completed their many dangerous trials. A troll's lusus is dependent on their blood color, as seen
   and

   All but one of the trolls' lusii have died (Aradia's lusus being already dead) due to either the effects of the
   Mobius Double Reacharound Virus
   or the game itself, and they were used to prototype their respective troll's
   Kernelsprite
   . They were all prototyped before entering the medium, so the troll's enemies have all their characteristics. Through these prototypings, the lusii gained the ability to talk with their charges for the first time.

   Being the only fuchsia blood troll on Alternia, Feferi was automatically assigned to her, however Gl'bgolyb continued to serve as the lusus of Feferi's ancestor, who was Empress during the events of Hivebent. When heiresses came of age they were expected to
   due to the demands of Gl'bgolyb and troll society. However, by the time of the events of Hivebent, Her Imperious Condescension had piloted her flagship to such a distance as to weaken her bond to Gl'bgolyb, causing its allegiance to sway to Feferi who was thus protected from any assassination attempts by the Condesce. According to Feferi, Gl'bgolyb frequently whispers to her. Some of what she says are prophecies, including that of the "world's end" and of uniting the two races.

   She loves her lusus very much, although she has expressed that "keeping her voice down" is a burden to her. She does this by feeding her the dead lusii of other trolls with Eridan's help. This is necessary due to the fact that if Gl'bgolyb's voice is ever raised above a whisper, trolls would start dying. The psychically susceptible lower castes would die first, and if the horrorterror raised her voice to a shout, every troll on the planet sans the fuschiabloods would perish. Worst of all, if she were to ever get "really upset", she might release "the Vast Glub", a psychic shockwave that would exterminate every single troll in the galaxy sans the fuschiabloods. The Condesce was apparently in her time able to curb this threat through
   , but her new distances of conquest weakened that bond - this is likely why Feferi was required to deal with it herself through feeding the lusus.

It blocked out the entire moon with its silhouette, and was

Redglare and Pyralspite continued to work together well into Redglare's adult life, with Pyralspite serving as Redglare's mount; this indicates that this may be the normal procedure in troll-lusus relationships after the troll reaches maturity.

   Cuspidated Grimalkins are known to take on bronze-blooded trolls with apparent skills for leadership (such as
   Dammek
   ). In addition the cuspidated grimalkin has a tendency to outlive their wards and will seek out trolls of similar temperments in such an occasion. This process is, however mysterious, due to the relative illegality of the species and the desired traits of their troll wards. Dammek owns a book about cuspidated grimalkins which describes them as followed: "The Cuspidated Grimalkin is a chimerical union of predator and prey, with the strenghts of both: long retractable claws and razor-sharp teeth alongside a defensive crown of stabbing horns, the speed for lightning-quick dashes and the endurance to run entire nights without tiring."
