   In both cases, Trickster Mode has become associated with certain alterations in the physical appearance of human characters: their entire color scheme is altered to give them brightly-colored hair and clothes, some sort of object (usually a candy, dessert, or fruit item) is stuck in their hair, and their color-devoid aracial skin tone is changed to

   click the Flash, then try these key combinations until you find one that escapes being swallowned by OS or browser hotkeys: Ctrl + T, Ctrl + Alt + T, Shift + T, Ctrl + Alt + Shift + T. (On a Mac, first try ⌘ in place of Ctrl.)

    Incomplete specific historic notes:
   </b>
   Make sure the interactive Flash has focus (click on it). On Windows and Linux, press Ctrl + T. On Mac OS X, press ⌘+ T. If attempting this opens a new tab in your browser, press Ctrl + Alt + T or ⌘+ Alt + T instead (respectively). Ctrl + T also works under Mac OS X for the most recent interactive segments (starting with
   Alterniabound
   ). If you are on a Google Chromebook, press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T. If none of these commands work, try Ctrl + Alt + T or Shift + T. On Mac OSX, Trickster mode can be accessed on Google Chrome by pressing Ctrl + T. It does however work in Windows, provided you have clicked within the flash window first. Firefox is the best browser to use for Trickster mode. It can be accessed on Google Chrome in Windows by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T.

   Trickster mode can also be deactivated with the same key combination. However, deactivating Trickster Mode while in an impossible location, such as Problem Sleuth's office or while on a wall, can crash your browser.

However, these music clips were hotlinked from external websites, and as of June 2017, the Captain Planet clip, the Ghostbusters clip and Aerosmith clip were deleted by their hosts and are no longer available via the easter egg.

   When activated in
   Alterniabound
   , Trickster Mode will cause a picture of a strange female (or simply majestically, Cagesquely mulleted) John to appear (a John version of Vriska), and a variant of
   Totaka's Song
   will start to play. The active character will then be transported with a
   Chrono Trigger "Gate"
   effect to
   the Jidoor Relic shop
   (from
   Final Fantasy VI
   ).
   Ness
   ,
   Paula
   ,
   Jeff
   , and
   Poo
   from
   Earthbound
   are at the side and
   Gamzee
   is dancing behind the counter of the shop. Interacting with Gamzee activates a sound test mode that allows one to hear twelve
   songs
   , including some used directly in the flash and others added only as a special feature. After leaving the room, the characters will continue to be transported with the Chrono Trigger gate effect whenever they use a
   <a href="Transportalizer.html" key="74e9fb62-7179-4acf-b695-a710d641de07" title="Transportalizer">
    Transportalizer

   , and the chosen song will continue to play. Activating Trickster Mode again will undo this effect and reset the music to default.

   When activated in the mushroom farm area, a prompt with the phrase "pap:nak ::" appears. If one correctly finishes the analogy with "shoosh:doof", John mystically turns into Dave, drawn in the style of pixel artist Paul Robertson. Holding down the spacebar fills up his "Mangrit Vial." When the spacebar is released, Dave performs an attack which can be used to temporarily trap the imp in time. Press the Trickster Mode key combination again to go back to being John. Leaving the area will also let you be John again, but upon returning to it he will still be Dave until the mode is deactivated.

   Similar to Alterniabound, pressing Ctrl+T teleportalizes you to exactly the same room, only with Sollux standing around thrusting in his battle animation(from the same flash) instead of Gamzee dancing. In addition he only has one song, Heir Conditioning. The NPCs in the area complain about only having one song, and miss the clown. Pressing Ctrl+T teleportalizes you back to the game, with the music for whatever character you were.
  </p>
  <p key="b6e5debb-3ef9-4ac6-8fbf-f2f73c0750c0">
   There is, however, a quick, easy-to-perform glitch that can allow you to walk around the lab with Heir Conditioning playing in the background instead of the character's song. You start by transportalizing your character into the secret room. Walk up to the Sollux behind the counter. Press space to open up the music menu. With the menu still open, press Ctrl+T. Your character should transportalize back to the lab, with the menu still visible. Select the song. Every now and then, this glitch fails to work, usually due to pressing the space bar too soon after pressing Ctrl+T. The music will revert back to character's original music if you switch characters, in which case you will have to repeat the 5-second process all over.

   There isn't actually a trickster mode in this flash file (that is known, anyway.) However, in this flash, Terezi falls through a trap door and lands in the FF6 shop, and a mashup of music from Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger begins to play. The room apparently exists in canon. It is worth noting, however, that the duration of Terezi's time within the room took place precisely between the end of Disc 1 and the beginning of Disc 2.
