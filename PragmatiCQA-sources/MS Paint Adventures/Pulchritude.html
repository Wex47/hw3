   character is. A high Pulchritude stat allows the owner of said stat to influence others, get the dames, and generally be a hard-boiled fellow.
   Problem Sleuth
   , as his name is in the title, has the highest Pulchritude stat, making him the de facto leader of the team. Conversely,
   Ace Dick
   is brutish and offensive and has a low Pulchritude, although it has not stopped him from finding love on at least two occasions. (Ace Dick marries
   Wifehearst
   and fathers
   Bathearst
   ;
   Fiesta Ace Dick
   fathers a child with the
   Demimonde Semigoddess
   .)

   , Pulchritude is even less significant. Your character can ask the
   blacksmith
   for
   Bard Armor
   with a +5 Pulchritude bonus, but you are unable to
