   is an event that occurs in certain sessions. Essentially, it is a mechanism by which a session, and the universe tied to it, can be reset to an indeterminate point in the past. The process releases a great deal of temporal energy, and the universe will then redevelop differently and eventually produce new Sburb sessions possibly very different from the one in which the scratch was initiated. It is a last resort for a session doomed to failure, with the intention being to attempt to restart with more favorable conditions.

   The kids activated their scratch as part of their plan to get rid of Jack, devised with the help of the trolls. In Karkat's first conversation with John (from Karkat's perspective), John heavily implied that the kids and trolls would meet in person after the scratch.

   The trolls can't see the future of the kids after the scratch, possibly because the kids' entire Incipisphere ceases to exist. However, since this seemed to happen just as the scratch was being initiated (and therefore the Incipisphere had not ceased to exist yet), it may simply be a mechanism to eliminate (or at the very least minimize) interference from other sessions during the process, which is very delicate and important. The trolls initially believe that the scratch is responsible for opening the hole in spacetime that led to
   the Great Undoing
   – the arrival of
   Jack Noir

   Red Miles

   at the time), although it is rarely used – both the troll ancestors' session and the kids' session are "unusual" in this respect (among many others). In the kids' session, the device
   the Medium
   has produced for activating the scratch is the Beat Mesa in the
   Land of Heat and Clockwork
   , a giant record turntable. In the A1 session, the construct is the Cardinal Movement, the comb and cylinder of a music box embedded in a block of crystal, much like the features of the
   Land of Quartz and Melody
   .

  <p key="effe716c-a0d0-4a4f-8182-32198895ed00">
   The construct must be scratched (literally) with
   a pair of very sharp needles
   (the
   Quills of Echidna
   ) to activate the process. The involvement of the Quills in the scratch may explain why in both cases
   Skaia
   displayed both the
   Time
   and
   Space
   symbols spinning as the construct approached.

   Skaia's influence however is limited, and it can only do so much. It has full control only over the defense portals, and can reconfigure them to lead to different points in time. As such, it changes the history of the host universe by sending ecto-babies to a different arrival time. It seems Skaia also uses this to exchange the roles of the scratched session's players with their

  </h2>
  <p key="a564ea7f-d669-4523-a2eb-d2f0293b14fa">
   The phrase "to start from scratch" refers to the act of starting something over, from the beginning, where an initial attempt has failed and the following attempt is made with nothing carried forward from the first. It originated in the late 1800s in reference to the boundary or starting line of a sports game, which was often physically scratched into the ground.
  </p>
  <p key="a70c8c49-d9e0-4852-9d15-e4d3edd7d00c">
   The scratch may also be thought of as analogous to a record scratch, a destructive sound produced when a record is forced to run backwards and then continue forwards from an earlier point. The record scratch is portrayed quite literally with the Beat Mesa, and symbolically with Disc 2 of Homestuck.
  </p>
  <p key="be6e4e99-a443-47b7-a09e-4fcc1b0fd7fd">
   Scratch may also mean to destroy or undo (as in the phrase "scratch that"). This can reflect how the destruction of the universes created and gave power to
   someone
   who would ravage everything in sight, including the universes themselves.
  </p>
  <p key="dbd515cd-31e7-4569-9dde-5e1870aac890">
   In billiards, a "scratch" is a
   term
   for a foul, most often for the act of pocketing the
   cue ball
   . After a scratch, the cue ball has to be "reset" to its starting position. While scratching is to be avoided most of the time, there are

   synchronised
