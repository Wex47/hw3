   are animals that are extremely important to Sburb. A giant frog,

   a picture of a frog can be seen on the platform that holds the "exit door" of the troll's session. Frogs are implied to be present on every planet with life. They are considered contraband by

   In order to breed frogs, the designated frog breeder must use the
   Ectobiology Apparatus
   to create
   paradox slime
   of frogs. They then have to go hunt down the same frogs that were cloned and interact with them in some way. This causes them to appear as slime when appearified by the player in the past, in order to prevent the time paradox that would ensue from the frog not being there in the future when the player goes to hunt it, in order to cause the appearifier to appearify the sludge instead of the real thing to prevent a paradox, which will only happen because of its paradox-prevention mechanism in the first place. Somehow creating a

   .

  <p key="d8031848-c00b-4b30-89a1-39344e3770a1">
   This is done in order to give the frogs time to mature while the player is out hunting them. Ideally the player is supposed to create the clone with some sort of mutation to prevent it from returning to the past and becoming a successful
   paradox clone
   . These mutations may also be necessary for breeding. The objective is to create the Genesis Frog, which will somehow become the universe the players create if successful.

   The frogs seem to have a secondary purpose as an
   alchemization
   component for high-level weapons.
