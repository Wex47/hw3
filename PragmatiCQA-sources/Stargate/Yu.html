   , one who is not a punitive ruler. He is the oldest of the Goa'uld and some would say the greatest of them all. Lord Yu speaks with instantaneous authority, though irritation constantly tinges his voice. Rarely does he lose his temper, and only orders reprisals when he believes that doing so serves his long-term interests.

   , since he kept the other System Lords in line. In his rivalry with
   Cronus
   , the conflicts between the two usually ended in a stalemate, despite Cronos' impressive military might and resources. The volatile aggressive Cronus often made foolhardy moves that Yu was able to counter via better strategies, yet due to his conservatism Yu was unable to take advantage of opportunities to kill Cronus. In addition, Cronus was often in conflict with other System Lords and never gained their support, which helped Yu. Recently Yu was in conflict with both
   Morrigan
   and
   Olokun
   , and through the application of superior force and strategy he remained victorious.

  <p key="543f8247-791f-4691-82bd-766780e64ffe">
   In the far past, he had four Goa'uld queens under his control, all of but one of them has died from old age. Queen
   Xiwangmu
   , the remaining queen, who is too old to spawn, still retains a position of trust and respect. Yu was also rumored to have up to 100 concubines spread across holdings, with adopted human "sons" on each of his planets whom were in charge during his absence. His biological children have been appointed to cultural and political postings, rather than military or political positions, thereby keeping true power away from their hands.

To ensure that no Jaffa immigrants can be infiltrated as spies into his realm, he only promotes those Jaffa of his own realm to positions beyond the rank of captain. Among his upper level officers, most of them have personally known Lord Yu since their childhood. He hand-picked them for their positions after checking with the First Prime and obtaining his approval. Due to the extremely rigid controls that Lord Yu has implemented over the military's behavior and contacts, the
   Tok'ra
   have been unable to infiltrate his forces and one Tok'ra operative is believed to have defected into his army.

  <p key="6c7b73ee-9fa7-4779-aab4-eaef1ba725af">
   Lord Yu is capable of committing acts of brutality, but prefers using bribes and rewards to maintain order in his domain. With a realm as extensive as his, it's a more effective strategy for keeping order, permitting him to conserve time and resources for other more pressing issues. He also uses the superior technology at his disposal to influence the production of food and agriculture by his subjects. Lord Yu will either withhold or grant assistance to his subjects, thereby gaining the loyalty of the population. Loyal or compliant subjects experience record-breaking crops and problematic or rebellious subjects have their food and water-supplies held hostage. By making it known that such practices are not common among the other System Lords, he has ensured good feelings and loyalty among all of his subjects, from the lowliest mine worker or farmer to the most elevated Jaffa.

   . Because his worlds are connected via a well-planned selection of transport corridors and satellites, it has made them extremely defensible and therefore very difficult to take via a direct attack. Since Lord Yu was alive during the Goa'uld's war against the

  <p key="38394a61-ec59-4a2d-91c2-4c2fcaa4f02a">
   Unlike most Goa'uld, who are generally megalomaniacal and obsessed with total domination, Yu can be fairly pragmatic and methodical. While certainly no friend of Earth, Yu is mostly concerned with strengthening his hold on the territory he already controls, while other Goa'uld will often haphazardly waste resources trying to conquer the entire galaxy.
  </p>
  <p key="0e6e237d-286d-4c9b-871c-fc03a2fac514">
   Yu is also often fairly willing to negotiate with Earth (as opposed to other System Lords which view all humans as just livestock) and achieve a diplomatic solution more or less co-existent with the
   <a href="Tau'ri.html" key="bd338041-8d52-4769-bfa8-ab7e1f3cbb07" title="Tau'ri">
    Tau'ri
   </a>
   , twice assisting them in their campaigns against other System Lords when their own forces were insufficient to the task at hand. However, it is stated that this is due in no small part to the fact that the territories Yu controls are on the opposite side of the Milky Way Galaxy, and thus most of the other System Lords are located between Yu and Earth: allowing Earth to survive helps destabilize Yu's Goa'uld enemies located between the two.
  </p>
  <p key="7546fe4d-edc5-4e3c-a35c-3a62793919af">
   Another factor is simply the persona that Yu took, that of one of China's early emperors, who was not really considered a "god" per se. Like many other Goa'uld, however, Yu does generally seem to believe his own propaganda (unlike Ba'al, who privately acknowledged the falsehood of this claim and was rather flippant about it). Still, Yu rarely asserts this fact, even when questioned, or endeavor to force others to acknowledge it (as opposed to Apophis and Sokar, who were rather self-obsessed with their status as "gods").
  </p>
  <p key="4d367f5c-4ad5-4b20-874f-931bbaa317cb">
   Unlike other Goa'uld, who might agree to an alliance with the Tau'ri to achieve an immediate goal and then turn against them when the time is right, Yu is generally shown to keep his word and stick to their agreement; the only time he "betrayed" Earth was when his senility caused him to make a mistake. Also, unlike other Goa'uld, who will attempt to exploit any chance to kill the
   shol'va
   Teal'c and only fail to do so when Teal'c escapes or kills them himself, Yu once allowed Teal'c to live even after
   K'tano
   had attempted to convince Teal'c to assassinate him, Yu implying that he admired Teal'c's ability not to blindly serve another (although it should be noted that his actions also undermined Imhotep's attempt to infiltrate the Jaffa Rebellion, suggesting that Yu's true goal was to defeat his adversary while saving face).
  </p>
  <p key="44636bb0-baff-407f-b767-ea6915490abd">
   As he became increasingly senile, Yu's orders became more erratic and unreliable, but his past actions ensured the continued loyalty of his First Prime,
   Oshu
   , who took control of Yu's armies while leaving his master as a public figurehead, agreeing to serve the more mentally stable Ba'al so long as Ba'al's actions would serve to benefit Yu, such as through ensuring the destruction of Anubis.
