     Kino
     with him. Later Rush, who was forced to stay behind, learned that only Telford made it through to Earth and was led to believe that everyone else died in transit, including Eli but actually they had actually traveled approximately two thousand years into the past on a nearby
     planet
     , where they founded a new
     civilization
     . He kept his habit of recording events on

     he mentioned that he has a

     Camile Wray
     said he was wonderful at. His practice of recording everything continued to be a key practice 2,000 years later. Sometime after his death, Eli's grandson
     Matthew Wallace
     would become principal of a
     new school building
     that was named after him.

When Eli decides to stay behind and try to fix the stasis pod, he tells Young that he's smarter than Rush and he thus has the best chance of fixing the pods. Rush personally admits that Eli is smart and has a lot of potential while trying to convince him not to potentially sacrifice his life in a possibly futile pursuit.
