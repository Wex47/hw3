   A wormhole is a subspace bridge created between 2 locations that allow matter to be transferred through one end to the other. Although not traveling at a higher speed, a wormhole reduces the distance necessary to reach a given location within itself (similar to

Wormholes are a vacuum of matter, like space itself, and the temperature of one is close to absolute zero (which is −273.15 degrees Celsius).

   The Stargate creates its own

   just in front of the wormhole and dematerializes any object attempting to pass through it so it is not damaged or killed by the deadly low temperatures. It then fires it through the wormhole and the other gate and rematerializes it at its event horizon. If a

   Wormholes can also pickup and deposit matter from places, although the receiving gate can remove this excess matter. On one occasion, however, a superheavy material was picked up by the wormhole and deposited into a passing sun, causing it to shift to infra-red and stopping plants from photosynthesizing on the nearby planet.

    , the visual effect was twenty-one seconds long, featuring the swirl of blue light followed by a flash of white light and several stars. There would then be two strips of blue light that twist and turn as yellow lights moved on the screen before a final flash of white light. The SG-1 television series merely showed the swirl of blue colours (as seen in the picture above) or the strips of two blue lights and the moving yellow lights, and only lasted a few seconds. This was most likely due to save time within the episodes. However, the full scene was shown in "

    The Fifth Race
    ". However the only thing different is the noise of the wormhole; in the original movie, the noise sounded like wind rushing, whereby in the SG1 television series, the noise had a wailing/whistling like sound.
