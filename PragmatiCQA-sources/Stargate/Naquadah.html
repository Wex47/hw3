    Naquadah
   </b>
   is a rare, super-dense mineral (atomic weight of 98.6389 (2))
   used by a wide number of different races. Its most basic use is as a weapon: Naquadah greatly amplifies energy, making it extremely potent if paired with explosives. Due to its unique properties, Naquadah forms the basis for many advanced technologies; the

   symbiotes
   . The Goa'uld have Naquadah

   on many planets; its refined form, weapons-grade Naquadah, is extremely valuable and often used as currency. Weapons-grade Naquadah is so dense that two

   symbiotes
   even have Naquadah in their blood. Goa'uld
