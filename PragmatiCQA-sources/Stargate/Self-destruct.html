    Self-destruct
   </b>
   is, by definition, the act of destroying oneself or itself. Applied to crafts and other structures, this is either the fruit of a mechanism, or sometimes an accident.
  </p>
  <p key="0254c904-9076-46ae-8a75-1ee73b4e5a47">
   As far as starships, space stations or bases are concerned, a self-destruct mechanism is usually implanted within their power grid, logically consuming a vast amount of the available fuel resources within the main power core(s), in order to provide the most destructive chain reaction possible, in the shortest amount of time. Sometimes, it's preceded by a significant buildup, resulting into an overload.
  </p>
  <p key="3d00006f-c319-4b2a-8aa3-df5f6c341f88">
   In the case of starships, most of the time they can be controlled from the bridge, and triggered once proper verification protocols have been passed successfully, but certain systems allow auxiliary control from remote panels throughout the ship or base.
  </p>
  <p key="0fa7cf3d-145a-4b66-aadd-88d8d48865e1">
   This is a last resort procedure generally used to prevent capture, or to cause as much damage as possible when the ship or base in question is overwhelmed by enemy forces. The resulting effects are generally cataclysmic in regards of the size of the devices.
