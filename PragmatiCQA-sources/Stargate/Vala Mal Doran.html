   Thanks to Jackson's efforts, Vala was later rescued and brought back to the SGC where, after passing a psych evaluation, she became a probationary member of the SGC which gave her the privilege to go off-world and also embark on missions with SG-1. Three months later, Vala's probationary period ended, resulting in her finally becoming a fully-fledged permanent member of SG-1 and the SGC. As such, Vala continues to be a member of SG-1 to this day.

   Much of Vala's early life is unknown. She was raised by her
   mother
   for sometime as well as her father
   Jacek
   and her stepmother,
   Adria
   . During her childhood, she was sold as a domestic servant to a weapons smuggler named
   Fierenze
   , until she killed him. At some point, she was taken as a host to the

   incited a rebellion against the planet's ruling Goa'uld. The people rose up, captured Qetesh alive, tortured and beat her for days on end, not realizing it was the symbiote that had ruled them so harshly. Taking pity on her, the Tok'ra rescued her, removed the Goa'uld symbiote, and nursed Vala back to health.  (

    ; this causes some problems when he isn't around, as she tends to improvise strategy or create her own rather than follow the planned one. The fact that she doesn't listen to most people could be because she is used to looking out for herself, or she simply dislikes following orders.

She has feelings for Daniel, and it seems that he might feel the same towards her were it not for the fact that her actions towards him come off as nothing more than attempts at seduction; then again, it seems that she doesn't know how to approach a man she likes other than seducing him. There have been a few examples to suggest he feels the same way, such as rescuing her instead of grabbing
