   managed to download only a small amount of the information within a Repository to their own computers to learn from the knowledge within. They have learned much, but the amount of information contained within even that small portion was so great that they had only begun to scratch the surface of what they had downloaded by the time the Asgard became extinct. Although it should be noted that the collective knowledge of an entire race who's fairly advanced or more is quite overwhelming,
   Thor
   speculated that the amount of knowledge contained in a Repository is so vast that it could very well be truly infinite. Even though the Asgard studied the Repository, they were so advanced in their own right so they didn't need the help of other races to develop incredible technology which, when they committed mass
   suicide
   , rivaled the Ancients' most up-to-date pre-ascended technology, and to some extent even surpassed them. The knowledge contained in the Repositories is so vast, that when Thor decided to use the knowledge to try to build
   a weapon
   capable of destroying the

   , he chose to risk using Colonel Jack O'Neill to do it, stating that while it would be impossible to search for what they needed if they simply downloaded the Repository into his ship's computer, O'Neill's conscious mind could hopefully access the knowledge and give them what they need. Despite being in stasis and connected to the ship's computer, Thor's theory was right. (

   While humans are unable to handle the knowledge stored in the repository, as shown with Jack O'Neill they are able to at least subconsciously access the knowledge contained in it and use it for various purposes. The one using the knowledge like this doesn't consciously know what they're doing and can't even consciously control their actions during this time. However, O'Neill proved at least somewhat capable of controlling what he wanted to find when connected to Thor's ship's computer as shown when he told
