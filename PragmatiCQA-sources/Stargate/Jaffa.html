   For thousands of years, Jaffa faithfully served various Goa'uld masters as soldiers in their armies and servants of different kinds, controlled with the indoctrination of the idea that the Goa'uld were gods. Although mostly men served as warriors
   , all Jaffa are raised as warriors, with strong emphasis on physical development and discipline. In many ways, they can be fanatical in their devotion, as a result of being taught from birth that dying in the service of their Goa'uld masters results in great rewards in the afterlife. They also believe strongly that their ultimate purpose is

   The symbiote grants a Jaffa increased physical strength, health, and longevity. They may live in great health for well over a hundred years. They do not experience advanced old age; rather, while their bodies remain physically fit, after about 140 years or so their bodies are no longer able to accept a new Goa'uld symbiote, without which they cannot survive. Jaffa do not sleep but they must perform
   Kelno'reem‎
   , a deep meditation. This time allows the symbiote to repair any injuries to the Jaffa's body and is necessary to maintain good health. It is possible for a Jaffa to communicate with the symbiote during kelno'reem, as in the case of the Jaffa priestess
   Shan'auc
   . The symbiote's healing abilities also make Jaffa immune to the vast majority of toxins and diseases, and they can survive without oxygen for much longer than humans while in Kelno'reem. (

   Through their symbiote, Jaffa possess the ability to sense the presence of Goa'uld, though this ability does not appear to be as strong as that of Goa'uld or former Goa'uld hosts; Teal'c has failed to notice Goa'uld infiltrators on a number of occasions when not already aware of their potential presence, while Samantha Carter seems to be more sensitive to the presence of Goa'uld.

Once used however, the body became dependent on it. Tretonin proved a successful replacement to symbiotes for the Jaffa, but Jaffa would lose the advanced healing that the symbiote provided. Over time with the absence of the symbiote the pouch also began to disappear. With the help of the

   Jaffa are a society of warriors and bear the mark of their "gods", a black
   symbol
   tattooed on the foreheads. They are indoctrinated to believe the Goa'uld to be gods, and did not see themselves as slaves until the advent of the
   Jaffa Rebellion
   . They believed that serving their gods is the highest calling, and to die while performing their tasks leads to great rewards in the afterlife. Without Jaffa, however, the Goa'uld have limited power. The Jaffa fight their wars, oversee their human slaves, and determine their strength and ultimate success.

   Jaffa are well known for their courage and strength of will. Despite being treated as disposable by the Goa'uld, they take pride in their skill as warriors and have a great sense of honor and nobility. They can, on occasion, be superstitious and have many legends; some, like the legend of

   are based in fact. Most Jaffa believe in an afterlife. The rebel Jaffa believe their souls will be taken to Kheb when they die, a mysterious planet once inhabited by
