When the stones are attached to the device, they create a link with the nearest active communication stone, allowing the user to take control of the person to whom the stone is linked and vice versa. As long as the link is active, the user controls the recipient's body as if it were their own. (

It is possible that Earth-side device was damaged or there were safety protocol preventing the two-way link from being established. (

   The device establishes a physiological link as well as a mental one, linking the well-being of those using the device. Extreme sensations such as suffocation or burning will be shared, and if one body dies the other will die with it; if the body that died is revived after death, the other is too. However, the minds of the people killed can become trapped in the stones and under certain circumstances connect with someone using the stones and temporarily take over their bodies. The device does not share every sensation. For instance, if a person were to become intoxicated while the device is active, they would only be affecting the host body of their partner; if the device were to be deactivated or disrupted while that person is intoxicated, the user would find him/herself sober in the original body, leaving the other user to feel the effects of intoxication.

   The original Alteran long-range communication device has a hemisphere-shaped base about two feet in diameter with a crystalline spire coming from the center. There are eighteen communication stone slots spaced equally around the base. When active, the spire turns blue. While the specifics of the device is unknown, what is known is that the device draws power from
   subspace
   . Once activated, the device is impossible to shut off; it has no "off switch" and any stones attached to it are locked in place. The only known method the Tau'ri have for disabling the link is to destroy the device. A
   Prior
   has been shown to be able to deactivate the device without the need for violence using his powers, suggesting that the Ancients used their own powers in a similar manner. (

   The Tau'ri version of the device has the advantage of being easy to shut off, in contrast to the original which must be disabled or destroyed (if only due to their lack of understanding in how it operates). It comes with a removable power cell, allowing the user to break the connection at will. Alternatively, since the stones are placed on a flat panel and not attached in any way, they can simply be picked up to break the link. The person doing so tends to use gloves or other cover for their hands while doing so, presumably to keep the stone from imprinting on them. (

Other factors can affect the stones, such as Stargate travel over intergalactic distances. High levels of radiation on one end of the connection can also affect it, preventing it from being severed when the stones are removed or even when the base is turned off, but this can be bypassed so the connection can be broken.

   who had come into possession of a communication stone. After an attack by the aliens, Young used this to sneak aboard the mothership to try to rescue

Telford's brainwashing was broken and he revealed all that he knew about what was going, on including the location of the planet Rush was on. This led to an attack by the

   and the two determined that building another Icarus Base was not viable as they didn't believe the crew would survive long enough. On Earth, the
   Lucian Alliance
   attacked by crashing a
   Tel'tak
   into Homeworld Command. The ship was armed with a 50 to 70 megaton
   Naquadria bomb
   . Wray and Greer attempted to reach it, rescuing along the way what turned out to be the Alliance pilot. In the process they accidentally exposed Michaels' and Covel's bodies to a fatal dose of
   radiation
   in the process. The two learned of this when an FTL drop-out severed the connection for a few moments. The connection was unable to be severed due to the radiation and Covel's desperate sabotage- Covel hoping that he and Michaels might be able to survive the deaths of their bodies if they remained in Wray and Greer- but it was temporarily severed again by an FTL jump so
   Varro
   could tell Wray and Greer how to disarm the bomb. The two failed, but Rush fixed the problem with the stones and sent Michaels and Covel back with the necessary information to complete the task, dismissing Covel's hopes that they would survive as weak at best. Due to problems with the Earth device, a connection was unable to be made for over six days. However, once the problem was fixed, Telford connected to inform the crew that the disarming was successful. (
