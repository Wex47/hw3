   scientist named
   Perna

   terminally ill patient
   , though Beckett was reluctant to agree to this test without a full analysis of the drug's long term effect on humans. The test was a preliminary success until the
   Wraith test subject
   died from 'food poisoning' and the human test subject died anyway. His initial fear proved well founded when
   Chancellor
   Druhin
   of Hoff began mass vaccinations which revealed a 50% mortality rate. Beckett joined his team opposing the

   left the planet, no longer planning an alliance between them. (

   Beckett is a pacifist by nature and rarely engages in violence, only doing so as a last resort in most instances. He has demonstrated no hesitation about killing
   Wraith
   or
   Human-Wraith Hybrids
   but balks when faced with killing other humans due to his oath as a physician. His dedication to the Hippocratic Oath has forced him into difficult situations at times; when
   Charin

   Teyla Emmagan
   's people, desired to die naturally despite Beckett's insistence that he could save her and add several more years to her life with medicine, he almost went against Teyla's wishes by trying to treat her anyway, citing his oath to preserve life but was swayed by Teyla in the end.
