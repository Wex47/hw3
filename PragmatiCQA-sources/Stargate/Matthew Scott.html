   Matthew Scott's parents died in a car crash when he was 4 and he was raised by a
   priest
   . At some point in his early life, Scott had confessed to his adoptive father that he had unintentionally impregnated a
   16-year-old girl
   that he barely knew. He would go on to believe that she had aborted the
   baby
   with his faith called into question. Up until this point of weakness, he had thought joining the
   priesthood
   was his calling. The priest, his adoptive father, died of
   liver
   failure due to alcoholism when Scott was 16. Though he remains religious, Scott did not become a priest like he had envisioned and by
   2009
   was a 1st
   Lieutenant
   in the
   United States Air Force
   , stationed at
   Icarus Base
   . During this time, he was hiding a sexual relationship with
   Lt.
   Vanessa James

   While on a mission to an

   , Scott is infected by the spores of an
   alien plant
   that covers him in an alien fungus. While the team struggles to find a remedy Scott experiences a vision were he is set to marry
   Chloe Armstrong
   . In the vision he is warned subtly he needs to see the truth. By the end of the vision, he is shocked to see Chloe's face has half transformed by the
   Nakai pathogen
   . He awakens later to find the team cured him with a transfusion of Chloe's infected blood but he may now be infected with the pathogen. (

After discussing the issue that some of the crew want to remain behind on Eden with Colonel Young and being ordered to bring everyone home, Matt displays compassion and support of T.J. and a willingness to stay behind with her so that she won't have to go through her pregnancy alone.
