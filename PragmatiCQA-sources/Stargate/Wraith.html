   Iratus bug
   , which began feeding on the humans. Eventually, they began to take on advantageous human characteristics, such as larger
   brain
   mass, bipedal locomotion, and opposable digits. Once awoken, the Wraith went to war with the Lanteans and fed upon the humans of the Pegasus Galaxy. This was obviously after many thousands of years because the Wraith had to become advanced enough for interstellar travel. (

   , the Ancients began experimenting on transforming themselves into immortal beings. On a

   , the Ancients built a facility where they experimented on one hundred male and one hundred female test subjects taken from around the galaxy while creating a weapon that would wipe out their test subjects if they ever lost control of them. All but nine of the females died in the experiment while ninety-nine of the males survived. Under the Ancients testing, the Wraith began developing the characteristics and powers they would later have. Eventually, the Wraith learned how to use their telepathic abilities and tricked the guards into releasing them. The Wraith stole the weapon that could kill them and the facility's

   Athos

The Ancients continued to chase the Wraith, setting a trap for them when they briefly attempted to return to Athos. Eventually, the Wraith were able to steal ships and hide the ZPM and weapon.

The "soldier" caste, presumably also male, exhibit noticeable muscular definition compared to the male Wraith of the "leadership" caste. According to

   The reproductive nature of the Wraith and their life cycle is not entirely understood. There do appear to be young female adolescent
   members
   of the race. Based on their appearance, the Wraith appear to maintain a more human appearance until they reach their equivalent of puberty. However, it's not known whether this specimen was a normal member of the species or whether she would have metamorphosed into one of the female hierarchy. Furthermore, it's not known whether all young Wraith start off in this form. The Queens do appear to make use of a method of fertilization similar to insects where they secrete genetic material which results in
   warrior
   Wraith being born in pod-like structures. It was believed that this process occurred on their

It's unknown how the two reproductive processes relate to one another, but considering that the cloning facility where the second method was carried had long been dormant before it was discovered by the Atlantis expedition, the most likely explanation is that the Wraith are capable of breeding in a similar way to humans and only rely on the pods when the situation requires them to produce a large army in a short amount of time.

   Iratus bug

The Wraith possess none of the normal human inhibiting proteins, giving them a frighteningly efficient regenerative mechanism in their genetic makeup, allowing their bodies to heal themselves. Their regenerative abilities are so powerful that, as long as the cells are properly nourished, it is unlikely that the Wraith ever die from natural causes the way that humans do, and even dismembered body parts have the ability to move on their own. This makes the Wraith incredibly resilient and able to survive weapon fire and the crushing depths of the ocean floor without any form of mechanical assistance. (

   Nourishment for the adult Wraith is the human "life force". Humans or very similar beings (e.g.,

    Ancients
   </a>
   or other Wraith) are the only food source that can properly nourish a Wraith. They are capable of cannibalism. It is also unknown whether or not the Wraith require fluids (e.g., water), to facilitate other bodily functions. The exact science (if there is one) of the life-force drain is not described, although it is portrayed as a materialistic process. It could be likened to sipping a drink through a straw. The Wraith can drain their victims slowly in order to torture and obtain information, or just to perform an act of sadism. As the victim is drained of life, the victim experiences pain and appears to age rapidly. This is not actual physical aging, but a by-product of the feeding process.

  <p key="d12dd0f1-4737-4d91-9abc-99ecd4a3b9e9">
   Although the Wraith possess teeth, they do not use them to puncture the epidermis of a human. Instead, they drain the life force through the use of a specialized organ found in the palm of their right hand. This is slammed into the chest of the human, typically where the heart resides. The nails puncture the skin and the feeding organ begins to drain the life force. During the feeding process, the victim is injected with a special enzyme, which strengthens the human body temporarily and ensures that the heart continues to beat. The feeding process is so traumatic, that without the special enzyme, the body of the human would shut down far sooner than the Wraith would like. Simply put, they make a victim stronger so they can take more time to kill them. In most cases the
   enzyme
   is released slowly into the bloodstream throughout the feeding process. (

   The Wraith are known to employ the feeding mechanism and the enzyme as a form of interrogation tool in order to brainwash humans. The process involves constantly taking the life of a person and returning it back to them making the human see how they would look as they age. The return of their life has a euphoric quality on the human. This was one of the methods through which the Wraith gained worshipers. The enzyme is a key component of this process and the
   worshiper
   becomes addicted to the feeding. Being deprived of this results in a process similar to
   Wraith enzyme withdrawal
   and can be incredibly painful. This ensures that the worshipers remain loyal to the Wraith and are quite willing to betray their ideals or former friends for the gift the Wraith give them. Due to the traumatic nature of the feeding cycle, the stronger the individual the more indoctrinated they become as weak individuals die in the process. (

   The Wraith can consume human food and drinks, but apparently it gives them no nourishment and is done strictly for pleasure. This is apparently considered to be a more sophisticated type of enjoyment, and not all Wraith do this, with most cited examples being those Wraith who have allied with humans for some reason. When the Wraith are young, however, they consume normal human foods (which explains their possession of a fully functional digestive system, as such a function is useless in the adult Wraith due their method of feeding). As the Wraith mature, they begin to crave feeding on the human "life force", whether or not they have tasted it before. (

   The ability to heal is apparently connected to how recently they have fed. If one has recently fed, they will heal almost instantly, though one who hasn't fed in some time is much weaker, but still quite strong. Even bullet holes quickly seal themselves like evaporating water. Females have a much stronger
   immune system
   than males. The species also has advanced telepathic abilities: they can force their prey to see things that are not there, and can use their mental powers to forcefully interrogate humans, though they are incapable of actually reading a human mind, but rather read their intentions (e.g. if they are bluffing). The Wraith also release a sticky, web-like substance that they use to
   cocoon

He attempted to dilute this capacity by returning them to the village to interbreed, but any amount of the DNA gave them the ability. The scientist gave up his experimentation, and the Wraith later destroyed the village, presumably in an attempt to kill the test subjects.

Even a small amount of properly introduced DNA is enough to allow this telepathic ability to occur; it remained even after a number of generations of the genes being "watered down" by breeding with humans without this modification. After the initial 'infiltration' by

   The Wraith are capable of projecting psychic projections making shadowy ghosts appear in a human's field of vision. This tactic is typically employed during cullings and battle in order to confuse the enemy. They use the hallucinations to keep the people in one place so it makes them easier to cull. During this time they use a shadow/ghost to scare the people away from the forest. A trained mind is capable of ignoring this threat and instead focus on the Wraith. A Keeper's telepathy is even more enhanced, allowing them to cause humans to kneel before them and implant suggestions in their mind. This makes for an excellent interrogation tool and a Keeper is capable of gathering data from a captured human with ease. This trait appears to be consistent among female Wraith as the Hive Queens are also capable of these abilities and are able to incapacitate humans who fall under their telepathic abilities. These telepathic abilities can even get a human to unwillingly work for a Wraith. A Queen was capable of using this ability to determine if there are any impostors within a hive, which means only people with Wraith DNA were capable of fooling a hive queen. (

   The telepathy serves as a potent communication tool, with the Wraith being able to interact with one another over great distances. However, individually, they were unable to use this bridge between stars. Furthermore, groups of Wraith or even former Wraith are capable of combining their abilities allowing them to summon their kind to rescue them making them a dangerous threat even when captured. However, this system can be exploited and Wraith are able to keep their thoughts shielded from their own kind, preventing one of them from realizing the intentions of the hive. (

   Hive Queens
   possess some of the strongest telepathic abilities known, and are quite capable of disarming military personnel by causing them to drop their weapons or incapacitating them. They were able to disarm an opponent in order to feed easier. This telepathy even allowed them to take over the mind of a human with Wraith DNA who are then controlled like a puppet by the Queen. Similarly, two powerful telepaths with Wraith DNA are capable of taking control over a Queen, but this can be a dangerous process as the Hive Queen works to destroy the intruders' mental defenses. In addition, it appears that they are capable of destroying a sentient mind when given the opportunity and seemed capable of killing an unborn child within its mother's womb through telepathy alone. Wraith Queens are capable of killing lesser Wraith and other Queens telepathically by mentally stopping their bodily processes. (

However, if there is a potential threat or resource of their hive that might be lost in such a maneuver, then the individual Wraith are willing to prevent actions that might destroy it. There are a rare few that seem willing to bargain for their own lives.

   Unlike humans and other species, the Wraith can be described as an almost nomadic culture which are based on their massive Hive ships and vessels which travel space in order to cull inhabitants for feeding. Typically, the security of these vessels were minimal as the Wraith are unaccustomed for intruders reaching their great ships, being the only major space flight capable race for ten thousand years. While this may be the case, the Wraith are known to make use of planetary based installations for research and to serve as strongholds, although these almost always have

   Within their culture, showing hesitation or apprehension as well as other such qualities was a weakness in the Wraith's eyes and treated harshly. They worked through instinct, and power struggles were brutal with assassinations of queens by other queens who usurped power to become dominant. This was only present with the queens themselves as a male who accomplished the task was typically killed. This was because the hive who had their queen slain would be terrified of continuing to live without a ruler which meant that they were often quick to accept a hive queen in power. (

     , Atlantis rose to the surface on its own when its power ran down, at which point it was retrieved by the Wraith. Using a worshipper with the Ancient gene to pilot it, the Wraith traveled to the Milky Way galaxy, infusing Atlantis with genetic material from a hive-ship to increase their own ability to control it, but subsequently abandoned it on Earth while they battled the Goa'uld. The naquadah in the blood of current or former Goa'uld hosts proved toxic to Wraith, with attempts to feed on these proving impossible at best or dangerous to the Wraith at worst. The Goa'uld Hecate attempted to create a Wraith/Goa'uld hybrid, but this action created division among the Wraith, with the end result of the Wraith Queen Earthborn allying with SG-1- who had been sent into the future after Hecate diverted an active wormhole around the elliptical edge of a black hole- to reactivate Atlantis and use it to take the Wraith back to Pegasus, after Hecate herself was destroyed in battle with the various competing Wraith factions
