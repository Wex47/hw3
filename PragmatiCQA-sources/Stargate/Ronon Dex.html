   Ronon was a native to his homeworld of
   Sateda
   , an industrialized planet. Little is known about his childhood. He had a
   grandfather
   , who was suffering from the
   Second Childhood
   when Ronon was six years old. He was taken to the
   shrine
   on
   Talus
   , where his grandfather was temporarily cured. There, his grandfather taught him hand-to-hand combat tactics until he died. He also had the
   Kirsan fever
   when he was ten years old and claims he played with a triple barreled shotgun when he was little as a childhood toy. He also wrote poetry and did art when he was younger. (

   When he grew older he became a member of the
   Satedan Planetary Forces
   where he held the rank of Specialist. It is likely that this is their version of the Specialist in the United States military, yet it is unclear exactly what this position does.

   During a travel with his unit, Ronon and his men's train  stopped beside a little village which had suffered a earthquake, assisting to the rescue efforts. There, Ronon knew a medicine student woman named
   Melena Omi
   . The quake had been caused by a group of
   Travelers
   which were on Staeda to trade and have stolen the

   , an Ancient device which prevented the quakes. Ronon tracked the thieves track, and informed his superior, Kell. He send them to Sateda's capital to recover the horse, but the Travelers have already left the plnaet. With Kell's aproval, Ronon's group followed the thieves top the planet Belkan, where they recovered the artifact after a fight with the Travelers. Ronon and his men returned to Sateda and returned the Horse to his place right before the damn fell. After that, Ronon began dating with Melena, although it is unclear what their relationship actually was. When

   After that point, he was captured by the Wraith while they wiped out the planet. Ronon was placed in a
   cocoon
   and a Wraith started to feed on him but stopped for some reason. Instead they made him into a
   Runner
   and implanted a
   tracking device
   in his upper back and set him loose to be constantly hunted. During the first few years of this, however, he learned several new tricks (some on his own, others from two years spent with a group of runners) and decided to hunt them back. He survived for seven years, until he eventually met up with the Atlantis expedition. (

   Particle magnum
   . Ronon is fond of gun play, spinning the pistol around rapidly. In addition, he carries a sword. He also has a number of knives for use in emergencies, most of them hidden about his person. The exact number of knives and from where he gets them (or whether he fashions them himself) has never been revealed, and Ronon's seemingly unlimited supply has been a source of the occasional comic relief.

    gun

    kickboxing

    , both featuring human military leaders forming close bonds of respect and loyalty with alien soldiers who obey the other out of respect rather than adherence to the chain of command. The two men have been seen as having an almost brotherly relationship, Ronon leading the search for John when he was captured by
    Commander
    Acastus Kolya
    and later accompanying Sheppard back to Earth for his

    , Teyla admitted that she understood why he had done it but warned him that others on Atlantis would be less understanding. Ronon originally felt that he couldn't have real friendships with his teammates despite all their experiences together and was willing to leave them for his fellow Satedans, but when his "friends" betrayed him he accepted that McKay, Sheppard and Teyla were his

    , the two are nevertheless surprisingly good friends. When Ronon was briefly recaptured by the
    Wraith Leader
    , McKay defended his strong desire to find Ronon by stating that they had a very close bond despite the lack of social time they spent together, claiming that he sees Ronon as a brother (Albeit a brother who got all the genes that he didn't). McKay even tried to get a gun to come help him against 25 Wraith despite being injured and flew a Puddle Jumper down so Beckett could kill the Wraith Leader even though Ronon threatened to kill anyone that killed that particular Wraith before him. Although less demonstrative about it, Ronon has indicated that he reciprocates this bond, stating that he was willing to take the risk of taking McKay to the
    Shrine of Talus
    when McKay suffered from
    Second Childhood
    just to give McKay one more day as himself. Ronon even admitted to McKay's sister
    Jeannie Miller
    that it was very hard on him to see McKay like that. Also, when McKay has a brush with near-

    and nearly dies, Ronon has a hard time with it as well. He admits to McKay that his scars are something he just doesn't dwell on as there's nothing he can do about them, and is shocked but happy when McKay uses his new powers to heal them. Afterwards, Ronon is extremely happy by McKay's survival and even hugs him, which is rare for Ronon to do as the only emotion he tends to display is anger. The two men also agreed to simply let the best man win when they both learned that the other was attracted to

    to help give Ronon some pointers for his interview. Although the two initially had some trouble getting along- due mainly to Teal'c deliberately provoking Ronon to prepare him for his meeting with the IOA, spending the better part of an hour fighting with each other as part of a bet, the two nevertheless formed a deadly duo when a group of Wraith took control of the
    Midway space station
    as part of an attempt to gain access to Earth, Teal'c complimenting Ronon's
    Particle magnum
    as they single-handedly defeated the Wraith currently occupying

    . The two seemed to become friends during this and Ronon seemed to take Teal'c's advice about dealing with the IOA when it was over which the two good-naturedly joked about. Ronon even pointed out Teal'c's habit of responding with the word "indeed", which Teal'c admitted was something he didn't realize. When alone with Carter during a point where he wasn't getting along with Ronon, Teal'c showed that he really was on Ronon's side and wanted him to pass the IOA evaluation feeling that he was a valuable resource and a good man.
