    Anubis
   </a>
   grew in Apep's favor, eventually earning a place at his side and becoming his most trusted adviser. By
   17,800 BC
   Apep's original sons and daughters, Ra among them, became jealous of Anubis for the favor he had with Apep.
  </p>
  <p key="4b19a26b-8819-4c55-bf8d-b6d335f6c3f5">
   It was perhaps only fitting that Anubis killed Apep, and that this very act caused the Goa'uld to do the one noble deed in their history; they banded their forces together in order to defeat Anubis. The battles raged for hundreds of years, very nearly decimating the Goa'uld themselves taking many Unas with them before Anubis was eventually defeated in
   17,400 BC
   and banished by the Goa'uld collective. Ra instated himself as the new ruler of the Goa'uld Empire, reinstating the old order which had been put in place by Apep. It was at this time that Ra also banished
   Thoth
   for his creation of the unstable

   into the ranks of the underlords. To ensure that the Anubis incident could never happen again, Ra also dismantled the
   superweapon
   which had been Anubis's staplepoint in his attacks and divided the
   crystals
   which powered it amongst the remaining Goa'uld. It was then that the
   First Goa'uld Dynasty
   ended, making way for the second.  (

   growing once more at a steady rate, Ra and the other Goa'uld were forced to push the limitations of their species. By
   16,000 BC
   , Ra had managed to solidify his authority and appointed a new form of rulership to govern the Goa'uld and thus the

   were formed with Ra as the
   Supreme System Lord
   . Ra stated that entry into the

   was awarded by a vote from the current members, creating a power system that served for thousands of years. Joining the first ranks of the System Lords were Osiris, Isis,

   By

   which caused Ra to petition the System Lords for a new era of expansion, offering exclusive rights and access to the now dwindling Unas in exchange for shipments of the valuable material. Their attention diverted away from gaining power of their own, the System Lords set about exploration in order to gain more and more Naquadah. It was perhaps because of this expansionist nature that the Goa'uld ran afoul of the
   <a href="Asgard.html" key="a4d4d97e-3c25-4da6-9918-e44e500efc20" title="Asgard">
    Asgard
   </a>
   for the first time in
   13,860 BC
   . Seeing the Goa'uld for what they were, the Asgard immediately declared themselves enemies of the System Lord collective and the Goa'uld responded in kind.
  </p>
  <p key="b016c963-2860-4431-b020-ec834b9df849">
   Relishing the opportunity to flex their muscles, the Goa'uld soon struck against the Asgard but it became apparent that they were more than a match for the stolen technology of the Goa'uld. The Goa'uld begrudgingly retreated and, having lost the co-ordinates for their homeplanet and thus their primary source for hosts, Ra once again called for stockpiles of Naquadah as well as putting an end to the ritual cannibalism which had been a part of Goa'uld society for generations.
   Nearly four thousand years later
   , with their resources running low, the System Lords performed a daring attack against both the Asgard and the
   Furlings
   which struck a resounding effect. Rather than winning the war, however, this simply caused the two races to fight back even harder and in the years that followed the Asgard dealt the Goa'uld many major setbacks, though strangely did not press the attack. Perhaps if they had known the danger that the Goa'uld would pose to the galaxy in years to come, the Asgard would have pushed harder.

   Despite the lack of a head-on attack, many skirmishes and bloody battles raged on for several centuries and, somehow, Ra found himself leaving his Unas host in order to take the body of the Asgard
   Famrir
   . However, the Asgard physiology began to reject Ra. Worse, in
   9,177 BC
   , he was injured in a battle with the Asgard. Fleeing his Asgard pursuers, Ra found a lush world in an alien system;

Furious at such pomposity, Ra assembled his own army and rallied several other System Lords behind him in order to once again defeat Anubis. Despite his previous victory, most Goa'uld took this opportunity to either turn against Ra and join forces with Anubis or simply stand on the sidelines to see which ruler came out victorious. The end result was Anubis being defeated once again but, before Ra could deliver the final blow, Anubis made his escape through a Stargate from assistance within Ra's forces.

   Seket-Hetep
   with slaves he had "rescued" to work for him. It quickly became one of his most dedicated religious centers but, a few decades after it was first colonized, it was cut off entirely from the Stargate network. Though Ra was no longer able to visit his people, their belief had already been built into their society and no word of the rebellion on Earth ever reached them so they continued to serve him for thousands of years.

  <p key="f569ca56-018c-48b2-b0e6-eb75bce4f5cd">
   Like all Goa'uld, Ra was arrogant, egotistical, and overconfident. He was apparently convinced that he was absolutely invincible, and never seemed to fear any possible threat (which would be his ultimate downfall).
  </p>
  <p key="30a5f07c-12e4-4a78-88fe-807f790415da">
   Even for a Goa'uld, Ra was very egotistical, a consequence of being in such a great position of power for so long. He was shown as not being very self-aware, seldom bringing changes.
  </p>
  <p key="ffbb10ee-a09f-4e07-b41f-f2390ed54ea7">
   Despite his arrogance, Ra was a keen planner, and seemed to have a better understanding of the human psyche than other System Lords. This is possibly the reason his closest servants were children, and the way he had them shield him (knowing that someone would not normally fire upon children). Ra was also ruthless and didn't tolerate failure or insubordination. In contrast to his confidence, Ra was also rather paranoid and recognized that steps needed to be taken to ensure that the

    Tau'ri
   </a>
   were not given a chance to rebel. When the possibility that his divinity could be challenged or doubted, he would react ruthlessly, killing innocent people to reaffirm his authority.  He outlawed reading and writing, fearing (perhaps correctly) that literacy and spread of knowledge would threaten his reign.
  </p>
  <p key="3515819d-eb0d-4be0-b6f5-398eb7b90216">
   He held the Tau'ri in little regard, seeing them as little more than tools for him to manipulate as he saw fit. Ra also apparently seemed to see his soldiers as pawns, made evident when he put his children slaves in danger, as well as his abandoning his soldiers to Kasuf upon discovering the revolt. Ra cared nothing for innocent people, slaughtering them without hesitation and attempting to wipe out a massive number of Tau'ri in one fell swoop.
  </p>
  <p key="01b03459-db60-495a-ac01-fda5a5e213f9">
   Ra's relationship with the System Lords is unknown. However, seeing as the System Lords recognized him as the strongest among them, it can be assumed that they had at least a somewhat, albeit grudging, respect for him.

   . The character was based on the
   sun god
   from
   Egyptian mythology
   . Ra was portrayed in the film by
   Jaye Davidson
   . However, the masked Ra was not played by Davidson as the mask was extremely heavy and was therefore worn by a stuntman. This also allowed Davidson to not have to appear on location since Ra is masked in the only scene in which he appears outdoors.

  <p key="c5845dfc-2000-4368-b600-753d3caca1f1">
   In the film, Ra's true form bears no resemblance whatsoever to a Goa'uld, as their nature as a serpent-like parasites was created for the series. The change was completely ignored for the series, but a few authors attempted to provide explanations in expanded universe materials. One explanation is put forward in

    Stargate SG-1: The Barque of Heaven
   </i>
   , where it is suggested that Ra was not actually a Goa'uld, but a member of an unidentified race with some connection to the

   Famrir
   , as a host, but Asgard biology proved incompatible with the symbiote.

   Jaye Davidson despised the costumes he wore so much, on the last day of shooting his scenes, after hearing the final "cut", he stripped naked on the set without going to his trailer. Moreover, Davidson retired from acting after completion of this film. He has only appeared in one film since, and that was five years later. He disliked the attention he received after The Crying Game (1992) making him reluctant to take the role of Ra in Stargate (1994). He didn't want to just turn the offer down so he made what he expected to be an unacceptable demand of $1 million. This was accepted and he appeared.
