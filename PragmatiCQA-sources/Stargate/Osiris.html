Isis somehow used this DNA to parlay for an enormous increase in power, and Osiris rose along with her by using his political savvy to pay for his place at her side. It was because of this that Osiris raised the expectation of some of the most influential Goa'uld, despite the fact that he technically did not have any power of his own.

Together the two ruled over a vast area of the planet, cultivating the local populace in settlements and teaching them basic agronomy, so that they could become domesticated. It was also during his rule that Osiris and Isis bestowed religion and ritual on the people of Earth, instilling fear in them as well as a rote obedience which ensured future generations of followers and slaves.

   Setesh
   , Osiris' brother, did not agree that the Tau'ri should be civilized, as he thought that it would lead to danger. As such, he concocted a scheme to dethrone Osiris and claim his brother's empire as his own. He somehow managed to convince Osiris and Isis to strike at Ra with him, assuring them that they would be able to remove the Sun God from his throne. The three soon set their plan in motion but, at the last possible moment, Setesh betrayed them and revealed their plans to Ra; as was his intention all along. Isis and Osiris hid in
   Kheb

Tau'ri priests somehow came into possession of the Stasis jars containing Osiris and his queen soon after, hiding them away in a secure tomb so that they could not be released. Osiris and his queen stayed in place inside this tomb for millennia, unaware of the passing of time, until their tomb was uncovered early in the
   20th Century
   by an
   American
   archaeologist
   named
   Sheldon Stewart

   America

   New Jersey
   with all hands on board. Osiris was once more trapped but, though he did not know, his queen had died when her Stasis jar had broken open during transit. (

   Osiris jar
   , unwittingly freeing the long-trapped Goa'uld. Osiris, sensations dulled, did what was natural to him; he sensed the nearest host and took its body as his own. Delirious from the new memories that flushed through his mind, and recovering from the stasis, Osiris had his new host.

   Setesh
   and so Osiris strangled him to death without remorse. Sobering up from the effects of stasis, Osiris began to sift through his new host's memories and feelings, recognizing the giant gap in both time and culture that existed while he had been slumbering. Realizing the ramifications of the murder he had just committed, Osiris acquired the suitable chemicals from the nearby lab and set up an "accidental" explosion to explain the professor's death. Satisfied that nobody would come looking for him, Osiris then set about searching for his queen
   Isis
   . He was unable to locate a second Stasis jar on the contents list from the
   Stewart expedition
   , and so he realized that he might need more time to conduct his own search. In order to do this, Osiris took the identity of his host as his own.

   Setesh
   had all died at the hands of the Tau'ri. Osiris stated that they had done him a great favor and that he would run without opposition, but Daniel claimed that Osiris wouldn't because the Tau'ri didn't worship false Gods anymore. While Osiris was processing this information, at the same time slowly destroying Jackson's mind with the Kara kesh, Jackson managed to inject Sarah's body with the
   sedative
   formula found in the Isis jar.

   beaming technology
   to beam into Jackson's bedroom at night whilst he was asleep. Using a modified
   memory recall device
   , Osiris entered Jackson's
   dreams
   and acted as Sarah Gardner from their time at the
   University of Chicago
   . At first Jackson helped translate the tablet, but he soon discovered that it was in fact Osiris who was trying to extract the information. As such, Stargate Command set up a trap for Osiris. Using a
   Jamming device
   to broadcast an anti-beaming signal over Jackson's house, the SGC personnel trapped Osiris on Earth.

   would release him to be free in the galaxy again, and he hasn't been seen since then. (
