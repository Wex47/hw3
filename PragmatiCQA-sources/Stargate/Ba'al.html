   First seen during the Second Goa'uld Dynasty, Ba'al was originally one of Ra's prominent underlords in service to him on

   where he was thought to be the son of
   El
   —who was, in actuality, Ra—by the Canaanites. It was in this role that he oversaw many cultures' development of an agricultural system, the
   Canaanites
   and
   Phoenicians
   among them. Ba'al's influence spread throughout these cultures so much that he was known over the entire Mediterranean basin and, eventually, most of the

   He was rarely seen to be a kind overseer, however, and indeed whenever his people failed to meet his strict food production quotas he very often issued orders for the mass sacrifice of

   lives. Though these measures led to overall prosperity for both the Goa'uld and the people, it came at the expense of many people and so it perhaps came as no surprise that Ba'al was one of the first Goa'uld to encounter rebellion among his people, though it was to a much smaller scale than Ra's later comeuppance. A few smaller villages abandoned worshipping him and so, for their pride, Ba'al struck them down.

   King
   Yahm, when he fell from the favor of the Goa'uld. He cast Yahm's body into the oceans on the planet and erected a floating city,
   Tsapan
   , on the site of his death; this marked the beginning of the
   Kinahhi people's
   enslavement to the Goa'uld. However, the people of the planet eventually rose up against Re'ammin, using his own technology against him, and forcing him to flee the planet. During this time, Ba'al was able to use his gravity technology to create

   his fortress world
   . He was forbidden from returning to Kinahhi by the other System Lords as they feared what he could do with the shield and anti-gravity technology at his disposal and so he placed the shield's power source in a shrine on his fortress world and while he continued experimenting with gravity technology, it was on a much smaller scale. At some time after this, while the Goa'uld still ruled Earth, Ba'al was temporarily killed by

   After the fall of the Second Goa'uld Dynasty, Ba'al was one of the first to foresee that the

   would one day rebel and so left the planet for the stars, earning him the wrath of his former master Ra, and causing him to be kicked out of the Sun God's inner circle. Despite this setback, Ba'al managed to maintain control of several

    Jaffa

   who had been loyal to Ra and so was able to carve out a small niche for himself within the ranks of the

    System Lords
   </a>
   . Though not entirely loyal to Ba'al, these Jaffa served him out of fear of his wrath for, even though they knew that Ra's wrath on them would be terrible if he managed to defeat Ba'al, Ba'al presented a more immediate threat to them. In addition to this, Ba'al did not hesitate to make examples out of any who betrayed him to their former lord.
  </p>
  <p key="01084f03-c8a0-44d4-818c-d20450b10eec">
   Following the
   Tau'ri Rebellion
   , Ra's attention was drawn to Ba'al whom he was able to defeat repeatedly until, in desperation, Ba'al turned to
   <a href="Sokar.html" key="0aae2165-b786-4aa7-bf37-b56d852df89c" title="Sokar">
    Sokar
   </a>
   —ironically fulfilling that Tau'ri's belief that he was indeed Ba'alzebub, the agent of Satan. Having been well aware of Sokar's enmity towards Ra, Ba'al offered him a contingent of his Jaffa—several having in fact been servant of Ra himself at one point—to contend with Ra on the field of battle. Although Sokar's forces were more than sufficient to deal with Ra on their own, Ra's former forces provided a unique insight into the workings over their former lord's tactics and so proved extremely valuable to Sokar. In exchange for this help, Sokar took Ba'al under his wing for a time, aiding him in his struggle to survive against their mutual enemy.
  </p>
  <p key="5e8d93db-d5fc-469e-a497-33d0d32d37cb">
   This alliance stood for generations during which time Ba'al took advantage of Sokar's help, using both his own and his new "master's" forces to carve out a significant kingdom among the planets of the
   <a href="Milky Way.html" key="28e3af5a-a680-4993-9243-94f188d0efd6" title="Milky Way">

   </a>
   . Because many such gains were made with the help of Sokar's Jaffa, Sokar considered the territory to be his though he rarely pressed this issue and simply left Ba'al be, concentrating on his own war with Ra. Ba'al continued to pay tribute and give respect to Sokar for the course of his "servitude", as well as providing a buffer against Ra's forces with his ever-growing territory allowing Sokar to concentrate along a narrower frontier.
  </p>
  <p key="39610231-38d4-4425-ab92-33836c80411f">
   Ba'al could not hide his true intentions forever, though, gradually subverting the Jaffa that Sokar left him to the point that he commanded their true loyalty. He eventually became content that he would be able to contend with the forces of Ra without Sokar's aid, Ba'al broke off his servitude to Sokar and declared himself the sovereign ruler of his sector of space. Sokar immediately tried to recall his Jaffa from Ba'al's service but was met with no answer and so sent two of his fleets to reclaim the territory which he believed Ba'al had stolen from him. Having learned of his attack, Ba'al made a daring gambit; when Sokar's fleets arrived in two of the systems controlled by Ba'al, they were met with only two

    ha'tak
   </a>
   's each. As Sokar's fleets closed in to attack the ships, Ba'al unleashed his plan and used the ha'tak's to cause the systems stars to go supernova, destroying everything nearby including themselves and the sixty million inhabitants on the worlds.
  </p>
  <p key="889e4b19-8b20-4408-9eed-aa803c65a903">
   Quickly deciding that the price of a war with Ba'al was too high to pay, Sokar and Ba'al agreed to a peace treaty so that they could focus on their prime opponent, Ra. For centuries after this the truce remained, both of the Goa'uld fighting against Ra rather than amongst each other. Though the war rained heavily on Ba'al, he managed to get himself into a position of power and eventually became a

   in his own right. Ba'al's war with Ra drew on until it reached a point where the attrition rate became unbearable for both, and so the two agreed to a cease fire, though they still remained enemies at heart. Despite this, the two System Lords continued to inflict covert raids on the other, as well as attacking each other through politics rather than force.

  <p key="dd264e29-048a-46b2-a8d0-d31b1be118ba">
   These actions continued for more than a thousand years until, in what was apparently a freak accident, Ra was no more. Unknown to the System Lords at the time, Ra was killed by Colonel Jack O'Neill and Doctor Daniel Jackson who had used

   to send an enhanced nuclear warhead on board his ship after a rebellion on Abydos. Though the Goa'uld did not know the truth behind the sudden death, Ba'al was quick to swoop in and claim much of Ra's disarrayed territory before

    Personality
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="399fa105-a60f-4cc0-8d08-6ab310e85dd9">
   Although exceptionally ruthless, Ba'al seemed to possess a somewhat better understanding of human nature than was typical for the Goa'uld, and he also has a vague understanding of the concept of humor. Unlike the "typical" Goa'uld, Ba'al's personality was generally wry and sardonic rather than melodramatically megalomaniacal; his methods often involved deception and subterfuge rather than brute force, and his style tended toward subtle insidiousness rather than outright cruelty.
  </p>
  <p key="92d10073-b5f5-4758-b2ad-402854c6a359">
   In keeping with his more subtle modus operandi, Ba'al also maintained an image of almost entirely non-military refinement, with a rather less threatening appearance than was usual for the Goa'uld. He had a beard, but it was small and kept neat, and even before adopting Earth clothing he was also consistently well-dressed. Notably, where most Goa'uld tended to allow their underlings to do most of their work, Ba'al was willing to take a more 'hands-on' approach to his affairs, seen most keenly in his detailed knowledge of the Stargate network, allowing him to perform such feats as developing a program that could dial every Stargate in the galaxy simultaneously.
  </p>
  <p key="0dc70eab-2216-4c65-92a6-843e5c8e6e1f">
   Ba'al was also distinct from most Goa'uld in that despite the above-mentioned ruthlessness, his motivations are much more complex than simple evil in a moral absolutist sense. He was rational, adaptable, and less attached to the trappings of power; since the collapse of the Goa'uld Empire, he freely acknowledged that he is not a god (prior to the downfall of the Goa'uld, he would treat his "godhood" rather flippantly to those who already knew about the secret — a marked contrast to other Goa'uld, who gave every impression of actually believing their own propaganda — even admitting that he doesn't believe in it, and saying that other Goa'uld don't really either). During the war with the
   <a href="Ori.html" key="01458ef9-22d2-4734-8206-9c51f31014bb" title="Ori">
    Ori
   </a>
   , Ba'al occasionally remarked that he found aspects of human culture "amusing", and even goes so far as to largely stop using the
   symbiote voice
   distinctive of the Goa'uld, only using it when trying to intimidate opponents. Also, he had started to wear elements of 21st-century Earth fashion, even when offworld.
  </p>
  <p key="aaf243bd-c8aa-47b8-a2a7-edbc82d9415f">
   In the alternate reality he created, Ba'al also demonstrated that he was willing to break the cycle of Goa'uld megalomania resulting in conquest, preferring to negotiate an alliance of sorts with the

   (with himself in overall control) rather than simply slaughtering and enslaving them. He even chastised

   for suggesting he do so. Furthermore, he was willing to consent to the establishment of a

   as it meant he was able to sway Teal'c into his service (although it is unclear if he would have actually gone through with this promise if he was ever put in a position where he would

   </i>
   to honour it). In spite of the potentially huge implications of this once Ba'al had solidified power, it proved a worthwhile gamble as Teal'c's military skill proved invaluable in defeating the other System Lords, and Ba'al showed willing to keep his word, providing half of Australia for the Free Jaffa (at the expense of
   Camulus
   ).
  </p>
  <p key="5ed4537f-c9f3-40c6-9787-a343d0965ac7">
   Ba'al cared only for his own interests, and was a persistent enemy of SG-1 and the

   </a>
   . Throughout this however, he displayed a very uncharacteristic ability to recognize universal threats, and occasionally worked cooperatively with SG-1 for brief periods when he recognized that it was in his own best interests to do so. This would imply that although he was egocentric and desires self-aggrandizement, he was not purely chaotic, but rather that he at times committed actions that would commonly be defined as evil, simply because he saw said means as being the fastest and most direct way of obtaining what he wanted.
  </p>
  <p key="759b7588-8a29-41c0-bf19-8588ecdece0f">
   Ba'al was also extremely intelligent and a brilliant military strategist, but his strategies, while used to defeat his opponents, were always aimed at giving him more power. He was also a more than capable scientist, overseeing at least some of his experiments and projects personally (
