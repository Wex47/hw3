   . This heavily strained his relationship with his father and never spoke to him since, leaving his brother,
   Dave Sheppard
   , to take his place. After his education at
   Stanford University
   , he joined the Air Force and participated in several top secret missions, particularly in
   Operation Enduring Freedom
   in
   Afghanistan

   ,
   Blackhawk
   and

   helicopters, as well as a
   V-22 Osprey
   and an

When the Ancients lost control, they sent several warships to destroy them but several nanites survived and were able to replicate.

By 2008 he was able to completely resist a Queen, although it cost him a visible effort to do so. The Queen claimed he had the strongest resistance she had ever encountered from a human. Sheppard's ability to do this likely comes from the experience he gained fighting off multiple queens mind-probes. (

   Sheppard's tendency to disobey orders to do the right thing has landed him in trouble with his superior officers. This ultimately results in his inability to transfer off Atlantis and his contemplation of resigning at the prospect of watching the IOA dismantling the city. General Landry said that this trait might make him a good leader but would be something that not many commanding officers would want in a subordinate. Even General O'Neill told Dr. Weir that she wouldn't understand not obeying orders was such a big deal as she was a civilian and not a military officer. (

    : Throughout their time together on the team they have always had a strong friendship. But once Atlantis was stuck on Earth. John lied to an IOA member who was shamelessly flirting with Teyla that she was his wife to make him stop. After John started watching Torren carrying him around and babysitting. John and Teyla both could feel their attraction growing. But after being friends for so long did not know how to handle it or what to say, which led to very awkward silences between the two. But after both acknowledging their mutual attraction they started seeing each other often. With Teyla having doubts because of her clan and of her having Wraith DNA and not entirely sure that John would accept her. John having to decide if its right dating a team member and who is under his command. But, John accepted her heritage making her understand that it didn't bother him in the slightest. Ronon felt their relationship was making John more sympathetic to the Wraith and didn't approve at first. (

When it was over, Sheppard asked for a means of contacting her for "professional" reasons. He later ran into some Travelers and asked the Captain if Larrin ever mentioned him. She later mentioned she did after lying and saying she didn't. It's indicated that Larrin speaks very highly of him and his abilities. It is implied that should they meet again that their relationship might develop into something more. (

    Ellia
    and the mutated
    Iratus bug retrovirus
    . Sheppard reciprocated this compassion by risking his life to try and urge her to keep fighting after she was infected by

    Organic Asuran

    remaining Asurans
    - was particularly pronounced, hinting at the strong bond between them that was never given the chance to develop into something more. (

    because she couldn't deny the attachment towards her people during one of the Wraith attack long time ago. Thus she is doomed to protect the security of her homeworld, but can't violate the ban "not to interfere" with other people. Chaya admitted she had been alone for many years until she met Sheppard, that's why she decided to visit Atlanis in the first place. After noting that Sheppard will still be permitted to visit her occasionally, she 'shared' herself with him. (

    are prone to the occasional argument, with McKay sometimes growing frustrated with Sheppard's apparent assumption that he can automatically save the day when scientific problems arise. The two have shown on many occasions that they have both a great esteem for the other's abilities and share a surprisingly close bond, with McKay commonly attempting to help Sheppard when he suffers from personal problems despite his own poor abilities with relationships, such as when he attempted to express his sympathies following the death of Sheppard's
    father

The two also have a habit of risking their lives to save each other which McKay actually uses as an excuse to go after him once, saying it's his turn. Between their close bond, occasional bickering and deliberate attempts to annoy one another, and protective attitude toward each other, Sheppard's relationship with McKay can be seen as something of an attempt to recreate the bond he would have had with his younger brother, had the two of them not been estranged. Fans have even come to regard the relationship between McKay and Sheppard as a bromance of some sort with the pairing of the two being given the term, "McShep". (

    Jack is one of the only superior officer that John had not angered. When Atlantis landed on Earth and it doesn't look like there's any chance for them to return to Pegasus, Sheppard admits that he probably could not get a transfer to another area of the Stargate Program. This was on account of his negative relationship with General Landry.
    Their relationship soured somewhat during the time when Atlantis had landed on Earth. When O'Neill informed everyone that he was assuming control of Atlantis, Sheppard was audibly outraged. To the point that was contemplating resigning after Jack declined to accept his request for reassignment. John ultimately regained much of the respect that he had for Jack after his actions proved to be a ruse to allow Atlantis to be sent back.

Sheppard was willing to work with Todd when the situation called for it and believed him to be the best chance they had of defeating the Wraith, but always threatened to kill Todd if he needed to, though he admits that if Todd stopped being a Wraith he'd stop wanting to.

As Todd started to starve on Earth, he decided to ask Sheppard to kill him if it came to that, knowing that after seeing his state in Kolya's prison, Sheppard would be willing to do so. Despite all of his threats towards Todd over the years, Sheppard was actually reluctant at the idea of killing him and jumped at the idea of putting him in stasis instead and convinced Todd to do it.
