   . He once claimed that when he was a young boy, he rescued a baby from the freezing waters during the night, and helped raised him, albeit ailed with brain damage. Lucius later grew up to be a baker, selling mostly
   bread
   , and muffins during festivals. Due to his annoying behavior, he was not much liked by his fellow villages. According to
   Willa
   , she "refused to share his bed more than once." He liked to travel, one day, he journeyed to
   M6H-491
   , where he discovered a
   herb
   . He brought some back to his home village, and started experimenting with it by lacing it into his bread. After a while, he discovered that people started to hate him less. Eventually, he was able to concoct a potion from the herb, claiming it to be medicine, which he would regularly drink. The herb's properties made Lucius the most liked man in his village, and worked his way to marry six women, including Willa and
   Heleen

He never did any actual testing, because after he had dinner with the locals, the pheromones in the herb won Beckett over, and was hence the first member in the expedition to fall under his influence. Eventually, Beckett returned to

   Weir also noticed Beckett's strange change of behavior towards him. Lucius intended for everyone to like him due to the herb, and knowing their capabilities, have them extract more of the herb on the Wraith outpost. Slowly but surely, the effects of the herb took control of the expedition members. Eventually, the only ones who weren't affected were Sheppard, because of his cold, and

   Sheppard, meanwhile, revisited Lucius' village to discover that everyone in the village has been sick, and learned that not everyone first thought Lucius was a kind, loving man, but for what he was, annoying, until they grew to him after some of his travels. Sheppard decided to get some of the medicine and bring it back to Atlantis for testing. He returned to learn that even McKay has fallen for Lucius' influence, and that Beckett, Ronon and Teyla returned to M6H-491 for the herb, without Sheppard's approval. Sheppard went to do tests on the vial, but needed Beckett's expertise on knowing how it actually works and find a way to counteract it. Knowing Beckett is under Lucius' influence, Sheppard kidnaps Beckett and sends him to the
   mainland
   for him to go into "detox", and help Sheppard counteract the herb.

   Lucius, realizing Sheppard's intentions, sends the rest of his team to find the two. After he is eventually captured, Lucius pays Sheppard a visit in the
   brig
   , and told him his history, and believed that Sheppard's team arriving was "fate", since they have the means to get more of the herb. Meanwhile, Lucius was also interested in flying a

   in order to fly it. However, unknown to him, Beckett already found a way to counteract the herb, and the ATA gene therapy Lucius was given was in fact the antidote. Afterwards, everyone was given the antidote, and Lucius was sent back to his home, after the villagers were given the antidote too. (

Sheppard noticed that before Lucius came to fight them off, the guns weren't loaded, leading him to suspect that Lucius paid a group of people to pose as raiders. This was confirmed when the team followed him to an isolated area outside the town, where it is revealed Lucius paid former

   Now free again, he encountered Sheppard again, who had a plan involving Lucius' shield; Sheppard borrowed it from him. He later paid a visit to some of the fellow villagers and told them that they can't rely on Lucius for every problem, and they must fend for themselves at times; Lucius wished to spread the word around to rebel against Kolya and his men. After Sheppard revealed himself to Kolya, his men opened fire; the shield protected him. However, after emptying their guns, the shield's power source became depleted. Meanwhile, Lucius' plan for an uprising worked, and all but Kolya surrendered; Sheppard would later kill him in a duel.

Even after giving Sheppard his shield, Lucius is still willing to aid him by rallying the villagers to Sheppard's aid against the rogue
