   Jumar
   to find the ship that brought the intruders to Netu. (

   After the escape of Teal'c in the Tel'tak, Jumar reported on the development to Sokar who decided to move up his plans as Sokar believed the ship to contain spies. Instead of waiting another several days, Sokar ordered that the attack be launched in two days. At the same time, having learned of the threat Sokar posed from Teal'c, the Tok'ra decided to take advantage of the fact that Sokar would take
   his

   into Netu's core that would destabilize it, causing the moon to explode and destroy Sokar's ship in orbit.

   Once the fleet was ready, Sokar took his Ha'tak into Netu's orbit as the Tok'ra predicted and called for Bynarr to report. Instead, Sokar was contacted by Apophis who had killed Bynarr and taken over Netu. Though Sokar threatened to bring the full force of his weapons to bear against Apophis, Apophis offered the information he had extracted from SG-1 and Martouf in exchange for Sokar making Apophis the lord of Netu. In reality, this was a ploy by Apophis to get close enough to Sokar to assassinate him and take his place. Sokar agreed to Apophis' request and Apophis boarded the ship through the

   Aldwin
   of the Tok'ra launched the weapon into the moon's core once Sokar's ship was in position. Brought before Sokar, Apophis revealed that the Tok'ra were based on
   Entac
   , a fact that Apophis had learned from Martouf. However, Sokar had recently conquered the planet and knew the Tok'ra were not located there and ordered Apophis tortured to death.

   Delmak
   and took advantage of Sokar's death and his already poor relations with his followers to take control of Sokar's forces for himself, establishing himself as a liberator who freed them from a tyrant and an unjust god. (

   Aside from the standard Goa'uld traits of arrogance and egotism, Sokar was made infamous for his sadism and cruelty, which were greater than just about any other Goa'uld, aside from

   . Sokar would frequently torture people right in front of him and took extra pleasure in prolonging the suffering of his victims to the point of maniacal laughter. This happened to both
   Jolinar of Malkshur
   and

   version of
   Hell
   , and was so inspired by it, he formed his prison world by bombarding the moon from orbit to crack the mantle and allow magma to seep to the surface and turn the sky red. Like other Goa'uld, he had a flair for the dramatic. His speech was twisted, and he usually had a flame nearby. Unlike other Goa'uld who demand worship, Sokar cares nothing for it as his followers serve him more out of fear rather than religious devotion. (

   Sokar never made any effort to appease or reward his followers, instead he preferred to rule as an iron-fisted despot. His
   Necropolis Guards
   functioned as both his shock troops and as agents of terror that kept his subjects in line, who lived in constant fear of their master. Neither his followers or servents had any privacy or any real love for Sokar and were in constant fear of dying at his hands. Every one of his followers constantly toiled to provide Sokar with whatever he required to increase his military power. Sokar made sure that the oppression of those under his rule was complete, allowing no room for rebellion.

   In addition those living in his domain were constantly assaulted by their infernal environment. Nearly every world under Sokar's control was turned into an image of hell. It gave him great pleasure coming up with new hellish landscapes for the cultures he dominated, resulting that the vision of his realm varied from society to society. His followers were constantly exposed to his dangerous whim and frequently were forced to live through the terraforming of a new planet into Sokar's desired nightmarish landscape.

   Sokar was a loner, even more so than the average System Lord, and had very few allies. Occasionally he would form an alliance with another Goa'uld, but he preferred having servants and enemies, not allies. His agents were a unique group, ranging from
   Demon
   -impersonating underlords to
   Bynarr
   , the scarred lord of Netu. Sokar also stood out as being one of the few Goa'uld that still embraced the

   as valuable agents. Several of his underlords possessed Unas bodies, and serving in his armies alongside the Jaffa were a number of Unas warriors. (

   Sokar has quite a disturbing appearance in his human
   host
   . Under Sokar's hood is shown to be a man with pale skin, yellow eyes and prominent black veins all across his face. This disturbing appearance further highlights Sokar's chosen role as the Devil.
