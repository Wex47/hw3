The original SG-1 was able to use the alternate SG-1's methods to send the various SG-1s back to their own realities.

     . When the remainder of SG-1 arrived in the
     1947
     of the alternate timeline, they learned of some of what had happened to Mitchell and Vala from news stories about the Stargate. Shortly thereafter, as the First Prime of Qetesh, Mitchell led an invasion of Earth on behalf of Qetesh and

     as discovered by SG-1 during a reconnaissance mission in New York. SG-1 was discovered and Carter was killed, but Mitchell had his Jaffa switch to

     . Mitchell revealed to his friends that he had taken a similar approach to Teal'c when he was the First Prime of

     and had been actively plotting to overthrow Qetesh who wanted to kill Ra and take over. With the help of the

     An
     , SG-1 stole two atomic bombs and on Mitchell's order, beamed them aboard Qetesh and Ra's Ha'taks, killing the two Goa'uld. Having retrieved the hand device, Mitchell escaped by
     ring transporter
     and used his position as the remaining leader of the invasion to order his forces to retreat. Mitchell helped SG-1 get the

     that they needed as a power source, but chose to remain behind in 1947 of the alternate timeline which An predicted would continue along a parallel path to the corrected timeline. Mitchell took An to meet

     Truman and planned to convince him to rebury the Stargate. During SG-1's time in 1947, Mitchell revealed that he had been put in charge of several of Ra and Qetesh's mining planets because his less harsh methods worked far better. During that time, Mitchell had set up the planets to be self-sustaining communities and hoped that the people he was sending from Earth would be able to get themselves organized enough to fend off any System Lord trying to take over Ra's territory. Teal'c suggested to Mitchell that he would make a fine leader of such a movement despite Mitchell stating that he was the First Prime of one of the most feared and hated Goa'uld and that no one would appreciate that his tactics had been designed to give humans a fighting chance once Ra and Qetesh were dead. Teal'c pointed out that he had done the same thing as First Prime of Apophis and before SG-1 left, Mitchell told them that he was considering Teal'c's idea of returning to the planets he'd set up and taking leadership over them. SG-1 were then able to return to 1908 and rescue Mitchell and Vala before they got trapped, correcting the timeline. Based on information that the alternate Mitchell had gave them, SG-1 also repaired the damage that Mitchell had noticed while trapped - the death of
     Mordecai Brown
     in a fire that they had caused that wasn't meant to happen.

     Teal'c eventually assisted them and gated to Praxyon. As Qetesh closed in, Mitchell held off her forces, Carter was able to find a solution, but would send them to

     contingent came through the gate, Mitchell was able to kill the Jaffa, and he shot the final Ba'al in the head which killed him. Afterwards, he met his grandfather and the two apparently covered up the incident which led to them apparently becoming friends as the two are in a picture together on the correct Mitchell's locker (where before there was just his grandfather). He later lived his life until he died of old age sometime between 1939 and 2008.

Somehow, his father's attitude made him feel like everything was going to be okay. Mitchell's father was also his confidante after the F-16 incident that almost made Mitchell quit his commission.

It is unclear if this implanted memory had any influence on Mitchell's own attraction, but unlike with the Emissary, Reya returned his affections. Cameron walked her to her home after she became upset at an official reception. Once there, they shared drinks and kissed before Mitchell was knocked unconscious by some type of electrical charge. Reya was killed and Cameron framed for the murder, even to the point of having the murderer's memories of striking her down implanted in Mitchell's mind. Cameron was later cleared of the crime, and was able to have the false memory implants removed. He mourned her death and was pleased he still remembered her after his trauma with the
