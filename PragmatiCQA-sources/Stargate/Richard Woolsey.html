Woolsey allows the team to search for Ronon and talks with Teyla about her rejoining Sheppard's team, showing sympathy with her situation.

Woolsey explains he feels his suit is the most relaxing clothing he has and accepts her return to duty before going back to his music. (

   Vice President
   Robert Kinsey
   's motives rather than blindly accepting his perspective of events, and has more than once edited his reports to show events in a more favourable light for the benefit of those concerned. He later admitted that while he worked for the bureaucrats of the IOA, their method of taking a very long time to make decisions and passing the choice off to someone else always frustrated him very greatly.

   During the
   Asuran
   takeover of Atlantis, Woolsey was shown to be the weak-link of the humans involved, greatly nervous to the point of annoying General O'Neill. However, when O'Neill was gone and the Asurans went after him, he did apparently put up a fight after psyching himself up given the number of shell casings where he had been captured. Unlike O'Neill, his mind was an open book to the Asurans who stated they got everything they needed from him very easily. He fell for McKay's trick and was shocked to realize that the team had used him for their own ends, having not seen that coming which was useful in tricking the Asurans. However, he seemed to be slightly mollified by the fact that O'Neill pointed out that in the end, he was good for

   , he has continued to develop as a person, more than once agreeing to potentially risky plans simply for the sake of helping the individual rather than making the more 'expedient' decision that would have resulted in people dying. He has also admitted to having developed some admiration for his new associates, such as commenting that he admired
   Ronon Dex
   's courage despite the other man's typically anti-authoritative nature. He didn't start out like this, trying to do things by the book right off the bat, but after dealing with a crisis in his first day as commander unconventionally and finding that the IOA supported his decisions, he seemed to realize he didn't need to be so rigid with his leadership and relaxed a bit. He has also started displaying courage in the face of danger such as when he risked his life in an attempt to help Teyla escape and when given the choice between fighting with the Wraith to the death to protect Earth or saving himself and the city, he chose to continue fighting. His dedication went as far as him conspiring with General O'Neill and Colonel Carter to get Atlantis back to the Pegasus galaxy despite knowing in doing so, he chose sides and his career with the IOA would be over after Atlantis. However, by that point he didn't care and thought it worth it. In doing so, he showed himself to be incredibly shrewd as no one saw what he, O'Neill and Carter did coming or even suspected the truth about their plan.

   At the beginning of his command of Atlantis, Richard always eat alone, and barely related with his people. For his, the first was the work. But the interactions with the
   Sekkari artificial intelligence
   opened his eyes, and after that began eating together with Shepard's team, and treated them in a way much more friendly. (
