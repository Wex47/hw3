   The Tau'ri's victory ultimately helped the entire

   and even the
   Rebel Jaffa
   gain freedom at long last from the Goa'uld while also bringing the Tau'ri to the forefront and making them a huge influence on the galaxy with other races coming to see them either as a big help or a grave danger.

   Because of the loss of two Ha'taks and most of his

   brainwashing
   his son
   Rya'c
   and using him to infect Earth with a deadly plague. Apophis captured Rya'c and by the time Teal'c returned to Chulak, Apophis had brainwashed him into publicly denouncing his father. From something he said, Teal'c thought his son was only playing along. SG-1 rescued him and brought him and
   Drey'auc
   back to Earth. Once there, however, they discovered Rya'c really was brainwashed and conditioned to kill himself and everyone on Earth by unleashing a deadly plague. Teal'c had to shoot him with the

   The Replicators destroyed Apophis' mothership, though Apophis was able to escape along with a bodyguard and Teal'c, who had been brainwashed into believing he was his First Prime (very similarly to how he had brainwashed
   Rya'c
   earlier). Apophis and his forces were able to take over the Ha'tak, but a single Replicator had managed to sneak aboard. The Replicators took control of the Ha'tak, flying to
   Delmak
   at incredible speeds. Though SG-1 and Jacob were able to escape, taking Teal'c with them, Apophis was trapped in the
   Pel'tak
   . SG-1 was able to disable the sublight drives, causing an uncontrolled re-entry into Delmak with Apophis being killed in the crash. Teal'c was later freed from his brainwashing by the
   Rite of M'al Sharran

   underlords
   to serve him, such as discredited Goa'ulds like Osiris and

   Finally, Anubis felt secure enough to challenge the Asgard themselves. His shields and modifications to

   allowed him to fight the Asgard in limited numbers. He captured the commander of the ship sent to stop him, Thor. Using a

   O'Neill-class ships

An Ascended Daniel Jackson bargained with Anubis for the Eye in exchange for Abydos' safety, mainly because the System Lords had him cornered. But once the Goa'uld received his prize, his vessel single-handedly destroyed an entire fleet of System Lord Ha'taks with the combined powers of the Eyes.

Without resistance, he destroyed the planet, but not before its population ascended, also with the help of Oma.
