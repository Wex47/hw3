   Lastlight started his life as a member of the hive ship of
   Highcloud

   First Atlantis Reconnaissance Team
   came to the feeding grounds of his hive and Lastlight was sent to repel them but instead they fell into a trap and the Wraith were forced to flee. Lastlight was badly wounded and his cruiser was forced to abandon him, but as he had recently fed, he survived his wounds and was taken captive by the

   Upon his escape, Lastlight ended up on the hive ship of
   Nightwind
   , a formerly powerful Wraith Queen who saw a way to regain her former standing in his story. Nightwind pretended that she wanted to use the retrovirus on her rivals and formed an alliance with Atlantis to do so. Lastlight, returned to Wraith form, contacted Atlantis when Nightwind's hive ship arrived and threatened to reveal the survival of Atlantis to the other Wraith if they attacked. During the alliance, Lastlight returned to his old room where he spoke with Teyla who he didn't expect to see again afterwards. (

He later suggests that this banishment by his beloved Queen along with his being transformed into a human twice drove him insane. (

   After the incident, Lastlight was able to acquire a
   Wraith Cruiser
   which acted as his main mode of transport. He believed that the initial experiments were crude and altered the retrovirus to create a
   newer life form
   that was the perfect balance between Human and Wraith. This was a being that was far stronger than a normal Human but lacked the greatest weakness of the Wraith: the need to feed. Lastlight tested the process on himself and he lost the feeding organ in his palm. Unbeknownst to the Expedition, Lastlight also abducted the

He revealed that in all his creations, including Beckett's clone, he implanted a biological imperative that made them susceptible to his telepathic influence which meant the clone could not kill him.

As they battled on the outside of Atlantis' central tower, Michael was about to throw Sheppard over the side, but Teyla intervened and pushed Lastlight over the edge. His grip failing, Teyla kicked his hand from the ledge, dropping Lastlight to his death thousands of feet below. (

   who tells Quicksilver to use the name "Michael" to search for answers with. Quicksilver's search mainly turns up information on the Hoffan plague spread by Lastlight, some information about
   his crusade
   and finally some information on Lastlight's transformation into a
   Human-form Wraith
   and a warning against him following his escape from

   due to his role in

   's death. The search reveals that the Wraith believe Lastlight died in the
   Battle of M2S-445
   and are unaware he survived to be killed months later. Intrigued but confused as why to Guide would point him towards Lastlight, Quicksilver gets
   Ember
   to share the full story of Lastlight as he knows it with him. Recognizing the memory loss he is experiencing as similar to what Lastlight experienced when turned human, Quicksilver questions if he was turned human as Lastlight was when he was "captured" by the

   Before being turned human, Lastlight had the appearance of a typical
   Wraith
   . Following his transformation, Lastlight appeared human with short brown hair, his hair having been presumably cut with the transformation changing his hair color. Once Lastlight became a Wraith again, he regained a mostly Wraith appearance, but retained some human traits. Notably, his nose was more human than Wraith and the two slits Wraith have on their faces moved closer to his nose. He also retained his short hair, further indicating that it came from his hair being cut, not from the transformation. After Lastlight became a
   Human-Wraith Hybrid
   , many of his features remained Wraithlike, but he lost the feeding slit on the palm of his hand and his eyes changed color to yellow. He also gained regular human pupils rather than the pupils of a Wraith. As a Hybrid, Lastlight regained his brown hair color, losing the white hair color that had returned after Lastlight's transformation back into a Wraith.

      Queens
      , required Teyla to link with them first. However, Lastlight's control of Teyla appeared to be more of a hypnotic command rather than a full possession. Two years later, after becoming a Hybrid, Lastlight was capable of linking with Teyla's mind over 10,000 light-years, farther than Wraith could even communicate with each other and implant a vision in her mind while disguised as
      Kanaan
      . Presumably Lastlight's ability to reach out in this manner came from his enhanced abilities as a Hybrid though Lastlight suggests that a bond had formed between himself and Teyla. (

   There were indications that he was insane. His actions and galactic domination schemes are a good indicator, also Teyla believes that he was and calls him insane. Michael was actually hurt by Teyla calling him insane, but doesn't deny it instead telling her not to starve herself just to spite him. Michael likely went insane from his experiences of being turned human, betrayed by both sides and ultimately abandoned and hunted by the Wraith who were his people. The Wraith Scientist

   After being turned human twice and betrayed by both the Wraith and humans, he became bent on ruling the galaxy for his own purposes.

   . He was merciless, killing his test subjects when he was forced to abandon his base due to a rescue attempt by the Atlantis team, although he perhaps showed a little mercy to the
   Beckett clone
   by not killing him and just stunning him. However, in this case he may simply not have cared as he knew the clone would die without the injections he gave him. He also displays willingness to kill anyone who gets in his way, such as the human populations of the galaxy just to get rid of the Wraith so he could rule with his army of hybrids. During his reign of terror in one alternate future, the hologram of Future McKay said that he eliminated everyone that was too weak for his tastes and just turned the rest into hybrids, giving him full rule of the galaxy there.

   Another aspect of his personality was his thirst for revenge against those who wronged him. Both the Atlantis expedition and the Wraith did him wrong and he wanted revenge. His schemes initially started with revenge through his own personal army and evolved to galactic domination, although his desire for revenge was still there. An example of his near single-minded focus on this at points was when he invaded Atlantis. He wanted revenge so badly that he wasn't content to just take Teyla and leave, he wanted the

At that point he had even more reason for revenge as his plans for galactic domination were severely crippled when the expedition destroyed his army. He claimed to be willing to let go of his revenge to get Teyla to come with him, but his refusal to prove it indicated that this was a lie. His desire for revenge proved to be his ultimate downfall as he delayed so much in leaving in order to get his revenge,

   During his invasion Atlantis, Lastlight displayed erratic mood swings and heightened signs of insanity. At times he was seemingly earnest about his desire to spare Teyla, but when challenged to show proof he would keep his word and spare Atlantis, after consideration, he grew angry and stated he would let her die and just clone her son. Also, after learning that Teyla had evaded capture, Lastlight became convinced she was toying with him and flung a laptop across the room in a moment of rage despite the idea that Teyla was toying with him at all being ridiculous given the situation she was in. During this period of time, Lastlight seemed crazier than ever, possibly having lost more of what remained of his sanity due to his earlier defeat and his desire to get vengeance driving him to even greater lengths to achieve his goal. At one point, Lastlight goes so far as to say that he is as strong as he ever was despite everything he has lost simply because he refuses to give up on his goals. (
