   who had occupied the planet thousands of years ago, had been experimenting with the mineral. Thanos had managed to create a small amount of Naquadria by developing a process to convert raw Naquadah, but he had been killed in a cataclysmic event that nearly destroyed the planet 3,000 years ago. The resulting explosion released a massive bombardment of subatomic particles which triggered a chain reaction and catalyzed the conversion of a vein of Naquadah near the planet's surface. While Naquadria was created on Kelowna by Thanos, it has also been found on other planets believed to be former Goa'uld testing grounds,
