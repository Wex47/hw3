Sheppard leaves McKay to dial the gate as he runs back for the others. Teyla and Ronon continue to hold the villagers off, until they are both hit by tranquiliser darts. McKay finishes dialing and limps quickly while firing at another villager, also with a crossbow, until he crosses the event horizon. Sheppard meanwhile, sees Ronon and Teyla unconscious, before he too is hit with a dart.

   Sheppard awakens in an open-air cage, with Ronon and Teyla. Sheppard attempts to console Ronon (even though Teyla previously tried, and failed), telling him they were inevitably bound to come across a planet he visited as a runner. Ronon eventually admits that it was night the last time he went to this planet. In flashback, Ronon was near death and was being cared for by the villagers. In the present, the village leader,
   Keturah
   , confronts Ronon about his last visit there. In another flashback it is revealed that after Ronon left, because of his
   Wraith tracker
   , the
   Wraith
   attacked the village and
   culled
   several villagers, including Keturah's daughter
   Linor
   . Keturah is convinced the Wraith were looking for Ronon. Sheppard and Teyla try to convince Keturah that the Wraith are no longer looking for Ronon, as his tracker was removed, but Keturah refuses to listen. Furthermore, Teyla is disturbed to learn from the leader that the Wraith promised to leave his people alone if they hand over Ronon to them. Keturah reveals a contact device, which is already activated; the Wraith are on their way.

   attempts to extract information about the villagers, namely their location, numbers and weaponry. However, the morphine in his system makes it impossible for McKay to give out a coherent answer.

   Back on Keturah's planet, Ronon demands to speak with Keturah. One of the villagers mistakingly walks too close to Ronon, giving him the advantage to take the villager's knife and hold him hostage. Keturah appears and orders Ronon to let the man go, even going as far as to threaten to kill Sheppard and Teyla if he does not. Ronon, realising that the villagers need him alive, decides to release the villager and holds the knife against his own throat, demanding that Sheppard and Teyla be released. He apoligises for bringing the Wraith to the village, but warns them that if the Wraith see Ronon dead, they will not hold their end of the bargain. The other villagers manage to convince Keturah to release Sheppard and Teyla, but he warns them that they will be killed if they try to free Ronon. With his companions now released, Ronon drops the knife, and is tranquilised again.

They see the village in ruins, with several corpses scattered around; the Wraith came and went, and it appeared that the Wraith fell back on their "promise" to leave Keturah's people alone. Teyla believes the remaining villagers were culled. The Major finds
   Ronon's weapon

   dart
   flies over the ruins of Sateda's capital city, and beams Ronon down on the streets. As Ronon quickly starts to run through the abandoned streets, he starts getting flashbacks of the Wraith invasion of Sateda. In the present, Ronon climbs up a ladder to the roof of a building, to look for Sateda's Stargate. He locates it, and starts to head towards it, only to see the Hive fire a shot at it, destroying the
   Dial Home Device

   Wraith
   into one of the streets, who immediately starts to search for Ronon.

   In Atlantis, Sheppard is confident that Ronon is still alive, and Teyla believes that since the Wraith previously made a sport from tracking him, they will likely do it again. Weir believes since Ronon was the one who escaped, they will not give him a fair chance this time. With an idea that the Wraith has implanted another tracker on him, Sheppard asks McKay, who is now lucid and recovering from his injury, albeit still fidgeting from it, says it is possible to tune the
   long range sensors
   from Ronon's original tracker they kept to pick up any similar devices, assuming Ronon was implanted with another. Sheppard says he will take whatever odds they can get.

   Ronon meanwhile, makes his way inside an abandoned home and finds an assortment of broken objects. He has flashbacks about
   Melena Omi
   , Ronon's lover who died in an explosion during the Wraith invasion. Ronon uses a torn bedsheet to tie a metal shard to a stick to make a primitive knife. When he hears a nearby door open, he moves down to the cellar, as the Wraith tracks him. Using his
   tracking system
   , he too follows Ronon down to the cellar, where the room is completely dark. The Wraith is able to see in the dark though, and as he begins the search, Ronon quickly emerges from behind and attacks him. Moments later, Ronon kills the Wraith and storms out of the building.

   Sheppard enters
   McKay's lab
   to see McKay lying on his stomach, since his injury has prevented him from sitting comfortably. McKay has activated the device, albeit at only a fraction of the power so that the Wraith cannot track it, and determines it's subspace frequency it broadcasts on to find seven similar devices being transmitted across the

   last time dealing with them
   , just to rescue one man. Sheppard is angered by Caldwell's response, believing he was saying this because Ronon is not a member of the
   United States
   military. He tells Caldwell Ronon is a member of his team, and deserves the same respect as anyobody else in the expedition. Caldwell merely explains that rescuing Ronon while going against a Hive Ship has a bad risk/reward scenario. Sheppard and Caldwell then settle on a compromise; the

   Ronon, now walking through underground tunnels, is being followed by a
   Wraith tracking drone
   . He finds a Satedan corpse and takes his armour and weapons, before finding an armoury to stock up on ammunition. He is being followed by another Wraith. Ronon manages to hide from the ceiling. When the Wraith looks up, he sees a ready Ronon shooting him with a
   pistol
   . After he notices the drone, he approaches and tells the Wraith Leader, who is watching the hunt, that he has to do better than that. He later walks away, while throwing a live
   grenade
   behind him, which destroys the drone.

   , calling for the Satedans to defend their home against the upcoming Wraith attack. Ronon wonders why Melena has not packed, as he sold his possessions in order to make her a part of
   Kell's
   staff, who get to go through the Stargate. Melena intends to turn it down, as she feels she would be needed at the hospital where she works. Angry, Ronon explains there will no longer be hospitals, and the Chieftain's speech is a hopeless attempt to assure the people they have a fighting chance. Ronon however, has no choice but to stay behind. Melena tries to convince Ronon to believe in the fight and show the Wraith they should leave Sateda alone to pick on another world, before warning him that they cannot run forever if they leave.

   Back in the present, this time five Wraith are grouped in search for Ronon, eventually leading to an empty warehouse. Ronon emerges from hiding to kill one of the soldiers, before taking cover again. As the remaining Wraith return fire, Ronon has another flashback, during the Wraith attack, where one by one his fellow squade members are being shot down while attempting to hold off the darts, until Ronon is the last soldier remaining. Enraged by that thought in the present, Ronon jumps out of hiding and, using the weapons he strategically placed over the warehouse, kills the other Wraith, finishing off by firing his
   rifle
   at the last Wraith under the ceiling. As the last Wraith falls, it activates the
   self-destruct
   device on its armour. Ronon quickly runs out of the warehouse, as it explodes.

   is in hyperspace towards Sateda. Teyla walks in on Sheppard, who is sitting in the mess hall. She has come to thank him for wanting to go after Ronon, even if he is an outsider. As they converse, Sheppard admits that he cannot express his feeling very well (that sentence was finished by Teyla as Sheppard struggled to say it), and even though he lacks social skills, he regards Ronon, as well as the rest of the expedition, even McKay, as family, and he would do anything for anyone, even going as far as to admit he would sacrifice himself the same way Ronon would have before they were released by Keturah.

   Meanwhile, Beckett is checking McKay's wound albeit without much cooperation from the latter. After they are finished Beckett wonders why McKay would go off on a mission to rescue Ronon, since McKay often refers to him as "the caveman" behind his back. McKay claims that although they do not talk to each other much, he claims they have an "unspoken bond", and further claims that Beckett does not understand.

   Back on Sateda, Ronon manages to get himself out of the rubble, and limps towards his local hospital, and into a ward, where he works to remove a piece of shrapnel from his leg. As he does so, he gets another flashback where Ronon walks into the crowded hospital to find Melena, who is busy working inside a ward. After they reunite, Ronon explains his fellow squad members are all dead, and Kell used them to ensure his own escape. He wants to bring Melena to the Stargate while they can, or find a place to hide. Melena stops him, telling him about a little girl who is wounded and has lost both her parents. Ronon decides to carry her to bring her with them. However, Melena does not want to leave everybody behind. Later, Ronon is helpless to see an explosion envelop Melena from behind.

   Returning to the present, Ronon sees several more Wraith, a far larger group, approaching the hospital. He spots another drone. Knowing that the Wraith Leader is watching again, Ronon brands him a coward. Moments later, the familiar sound of
   P90
   fire strikes the device, and it is destroyed. It is Sheppard and Teyla; they have come to rescue him. But they have to act fast, as 25 Wraith soldiers are closing in. Ronon however, raises a pistol, explaining that he does not want to go anywhere, citing the Wraith's deal with Keturah's people. He hears from Teyla that the Wraith did not honour the deal, but he still does not want to leave yet, as he wants to kill the Wraith responsible "for all this", believing that if they kill the 25 Wraith after him now, he can get the Wraith Leader to come to the planet and fight him personally. While McKay thinks its a terrible idea, Sheppard decides to support Ronon, though Ronon wants Sheppard and Teyla to stay out of his way. Before they part again, Sheppard gives Ronon back his weapon.

   As the three kill all the Wraith in the hospital, which angers the Wraith Leader, McKay and Beckett, who are on board the Puddle Jumper, decide to do something about it. Beckett gets out a machine gun to help Sheppard, but finds himself struggling with McKay over it. Beckett eventually reasons that they can both go as there are other guns, though by that time, Sheppard radios back that all the Wraith are dead. Ronon gets a hold of the Wraith Leader, and goads him to go down and kill Ronon himself, which the leader obliges to. Ronon later passes Sheppard, and warns him; "you kill him before I do, I kill you", but gives Sheppard permission to kill him should Ronon die.

   The Wraith Leader beams down to the planet from a dart. Ronon pulls out a knife and charges at the Wraith, only for the Wraith to backhand Ronon onto a wall. Due to his size and strength combined with Ronon's earlier injuries the Wraith beats Ronon with ease, with Ronon's blows having no effect on him. Sheppard and Teyla are on the rooftops observing the fight, with Sheppard contemplating shooting the Wraith, although Teyla warns him if the Wraith dies, Ronon might not really kill him, but more likely wouldn't forgive him, and the Hive will blast them all from space. Despite Ronon's best efforts, the Wraith Leader defeats him and prepares to feed as Sheppard continues to hesitate. Suddenly, the Puddle Jumper decloaks in front of them, surprising everyone. Ronon tells the Wraith Leader "I win" while Beckett quips "if he doesn't like it he can sue me" before firing a
   drone weapon
   at the Wraith Leader. The drone picks up the Wraith and pushes him to the end of the street, where the drone, and the Wraith, explode. Sheppard and Teyla quickly help Ronon to the back of Jumper, and it flies quickly away as the Hive Ship tries, and fails, to shoot it down.

   Later, the Jumper is in orbit, where McKay and Beckett go to the back to check on the rest of the team. When Ronon asks who killed the Wraith, Beckett takes the credit for the kill while McKay tells him it was his idea. Ronon quickly stands up, where Sheppard tells Beckett that he vowed to kill whoever killed the Wraith first causing McKay to quickly blame the whole thing on Beckett. However, to everyone's surprise, Ronon grabs Beckett to embrace the doctor instead, and thanks him, as well as the rest for their effort in rescuing him. He sits back down to rest as Beckett prepares to remove the second tracker. He asks Ronon if he does not mind a
   sedative
   this time. However, instead Ronon passes out. McKay then returns to the cockpit to fly the Jumper back to the

The Runner's leader was the one who trained Ronon to fight back but he left when the group started going too far. He also confirms the Wraith Leader is the one responsible for him become a Runner in the first place, telling his former friend that he got revenge and did it with the help of his friends while remembering Beckett killing the Wraith Leader to save him.
