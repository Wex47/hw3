Scott then informs Rush that many people back in the

Rush is having trouble understanding why he wasn't able to dial the ninth chevron address and blames Eli's solution to the proof as the reason. However, Eli strongly protests this. Just as the two are about to argue, Young arrives and tells Eli that he is invited to a meal in the base's

   F-302 fighter-interceptor

Rush, who has become quite frustrated in his attempts to "fix" Eli's proof, briefly steps into the adjacent kitchen. After looking at the group briefly,

Meanwhile, most of the civilians, including Eli, have gathered inside the base's gate room. Rush discovers that power levels in the core are becoming unstable. Because of this, Rush asks for Eli's help in determining how to dial the Stargate's ninth chevron as, due to the orbital bombardment, the planet's core might go critical, causing it to explode. If that were to occur, it could end their chances of achieving a ninth chevron lock forever. Eli suggests that, if his math does indeed work, the problem could be with the address'

Young, carrying an injured SG member back into the base, just barely avoids a damaged fighter that slams into the platform they were defending just moments prior, causing it to go up in a massive explosion. While Riley does as ordered, Eli suggests to Rush that, since all symbols on the Stargate are constellations as seen from Earth, Earth may be the only valid point of origin, like a code, to enable the ninth chevron to lock. Deciding to test Eli's hypothesis, Rush pushes Riley out of the way, halts the dialing sequence to Earth, and begins to dial the ninth chevron address.
