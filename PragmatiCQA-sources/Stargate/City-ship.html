   A City-ship's design much more closely resembles that of a modern city than a spacecraft with systems and living quarters distributed throughout several towers that extend away from the drive system; while in flight, the top of a City-ship would be considered the "front".

  <p key="07c1e543-7292-4560-a627-3d20959c399b">
   All known City-ships are capable of planetary landing; and indeed, they do not seem to have been designed primarily to function in space. Their hulls are not airtight, requiring the use of a
   shield
   to maintain atmosphere. As they are typically powered by three

    Zero Point Modules

   , the shields are exceptionally powerful, withstanding days of constant enemy fire with just one ZPM; though probably as a result of this, the hull itself is quite fragile. As evidenced by Atlantis, City-ships are inherently buoyant, capable of floating on the surface of a large body of water without any apparent technological aid; they can also rest on the bottom of an ocean, though again the shield is needed to prevent flooding.

   City-ships carry a large number of
   Drone weapons
   . (The
   Atlantis expedition
   did, however, install
   RG/BBT SG military mounted guns
   on Atlantis for use as point-defense weapons against the
   Wraith Darts
   attacking the city, but these were unnecessary for the Lanteans as such crude weapons were no match for a shield powered by three ZPMs and the city's thousands of drone weapons could destroy any ships attacking the city.) (

   In addition, City-ships can host a myriad of other systems, many of which can be run without the need for a ZPM. Most of the offensive systems, such as the drones, can be run off a pair of Mark II
   Naquadah generators
   , in a state of barely controlled overload. They require a ZPM for extended operations however, as does the
   shield
   . The
   Stardrive
   is designed to function with three ZPMs, but it is possible (though inadvisable) to fly the city with less. The
   Atlantis expedition
   managed to do so with only one ZPM, albeit using additional energy supplied by an
   Lantean
   geothermal
   drilling platform

   Control chair
   was the main method of activating and operating the city's
   Stardrive
   , and could also be used to control and configure some of the city's systems; in theory, the Control chair could also be used as a backup command center, although only one person can use the chair at any one time. If the control tower was destroyed, it was possible to relocate the command and control systems to another part of the city; however, the strain of governing the entire city was sometimes more than the local systems could handle.

   An important part of the Cityship was the chair room which contained a
   Control chair
   that responded to the mental input of its user. Through this, a user with the
   Ancient Technology Activation gene
   was capable of interfacing with the city's systems, allowing him or her to control the weapon systems of the ship. The chair was also used to control the navigation systems and Stardrive, and could also be used to reconfigure power systems (and most likely numerous other systems as well). (

   Another command and control system presumably installed in all City-ships was the
   Lantean lockout device
   . This was hidden in the Gate Room, concealed beneath the floor. New occupants of the city, unaware of the design feature, might live in ignorance of the mechanism being present. Once a
   Lantean
   was present, the fail-safe could be telepathically activated, after which it was designed to shut down the entire city and return it to Lantean control. (

   A City-ship possessed a highly automated computer system which was linked with the sensors and tasked with defending the city to a certain degree. When detecting a disease or pathogen in areas where the sensors were active, the City-ship engaged an automatic
   quarantine lockdown
   program which shut out users of the system. This was to prevent the spread of any illness by closing down systems such as the
   transporters
   and locking the doors in order to contain the spread of the disease. The city's sensors were sophisticated enough to detect any personnel wearing bio-suits (even those not designed by the
   Lanteans
   themselves) and allow those individuals safe passage to treat the infected. (

   These vessel's internal sensors allowed for the detection of individuals or objects inside the city. However, if power was shut down in a certain area then the sensors in that grid were offline and incapable of providing information to the control room. Another aspect of this sensor grid was the biometric sensor which was capable of detecting irregularities in biometric rhythm and reporting them to the system. This made it similar to a
   Life signs detector
   ; however, this more powerful city-based sensor was capable of discerning alien lifeforms from human, and reporting to the crew the presence of these aliens in the city. However, it required a significant amount of power to operate (though it was possible to focus the scanning field to certain parts of the city, thus reducing power requirements drastically). (

   In addition, the City-ships were equipped with powerful
   long range sensors
   capable of detecting distant ships, even if those ships were traveling in
   hyperspace
   . The data collected by these sensors could be routed through the control chair; the user of the chair could project a
   hologram

   Asurans

   could churn out at once, and so at least two were typically required to successfully power the Stardrive. In fact, only a power source on the magnitude of a ZPM could provide enough power to energize the
   Inertial dampeners
   and provide enough thrust to allow the multi-million ton city to achieve escape velocity; the hyperdrive itself required relatively little power. If only one ZPM was powering the City-ship, other power sources were required to provide enough power to lift the city off of a planet's surface. However, the stardrive requires someone in the Control Chair at all times while in flight. As Admah's history can prove it, a City-ship can move even an entire moon, and in very little time. (

   In battle, a city-ship is an extremely effective weapons platform to the point that Atlantis firing drones still strikes fear in the Wraith even ten thousand years after the Ancients fell. Powered by two ZPMs, one only minimally charged, Atlantis was capable of holding off an entire Wraith fleet, including five hive ships, with only the

   Second Battle of Atlantis

   to power the city to its full capacity. This energy distribution system was essential in powering the various aspects of the city, such as weapons, shields, and engines. Although it was possible to reinforce the power grid with other power sources, the system worked best with ZPMs. There existed a fine level of control over the distribution of power throughout the city, and it was possible to circumvent the flow of energy of certain sections of the city to other areas. One of the main power conduits ran beneath the control tower and led directly into the power module hub, much like an express lane. While it was possible to shut down other parts of the city, this conduit was required to keep the energy distribution grid moving along. The city also included a series of solar-powered generators which added to the power grid as well as energy from a
   mobile drilling platform

   On at least
   Atlantis
   , in the event of landing on a planet with a much colder temperature than normal, the city-ship has systems to protect itself. Upon the sensors detecting the harsher environment, parts of the city-ship will reshape themselves to offer better protection to its inhabitants. If enough ice is detected in the water, the city-ship will deploy a series of spikes and cables underwater to form a sort of fence protecting the more delicate components on the underside of the city-ship from chunks of ice without the need to deploy the shield. This was presumably a low-tech defense mechanism created to protect Atlantis while it was in
   Antarctica
   . However, these underwater defenses will not deploy if the
   underwater sensors
   are damaged, preventing the city-ship from detecting the need to deploy them. (
