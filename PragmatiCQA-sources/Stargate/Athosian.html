   were a formerly technologically advanced-turned primitive hunter-gatherer like human culture native to the
   Pegasus
   galaxy, from the planet
   Athos
   . They were the first race in Pegasus to be encountered by the
   Atlantis expedition
   in
   2004
   . Mostly consisting of farmers, hunters and traders, they formed an alliance with the expedition after they helped them evacuate to
   Lantea
   after they were attacked by the
   Wraith
   . By
   2006
   , they moved to a new settlement known as
   New Athos
   , a relatively safe planet until they were taken captive by
   Michael Kenmore
   , who used them for experimentation to his
   Human-Wraith Hybrid
   . Several were killed and several more were turned into Hybrids, but they were eventually rescued and some Hybrid Athosians reverted to humans again.

   At one point, the Athosians were a technologically advanced race, and created such technologies as
   Fire starters
   , as well as living in cities. However, they were, like all humans in the galaxy, periodically culled by the
   Wraith
   . In one instance, they were once almost completely wiped out from the

   Wraith scientist
   , who experimented on Humans to make the feeding process more efficient, by introducing them to Wraith
   DNA
   . After they were brought back, they were able to have the ability to sense Wraith. They believe that the ancestors (the

Those who survived became outcasts, including Teyla's distant relatives. They were renowned as traders, and traveled to various other worlds within the galaxy through the use of the

   In

   , the Athosians were the first race of people encountered by the
   Atlantis expedition
   . However, their first contact was short lived when the
   Wraith
   arrived and culled the planet. The Athosians were forced to abandon
   Athos

   Major
   John Sheppard
   and
   Lt.
   Aiden Ford
   discovered land on
   Lantea
   , and after the Athosians became aware of the continent's existence, this presented them with a choice to leave the city and they all moved to make settlement on the
   mainland
   . They built a new village and grew crops for themselves and the expedition to replenish their food shortage. (

   Despite living on the mainland, they still had to be frequently evacuated to Atlantis in emergencies such as the arrival of Wraith ships and in one instance a
   superstorm
   that occurred every 20 to 30 years striking the planet. Eventually, when the
   Lanteans
   arrived back to Atlantis to temporarily retake control of the city, they were moved to a relatively safe planet, later to be named
   New Athos
   , where they rebuilt their society again. However, after Sheppard's
   team
   retook the city after an
   Asuran
   attack, the Athosians decided to stay on New Athos. (

   Torren John
   and the Hybrids were also rescued, and the Hybrids were reverted to human again. They then returned to New Athos. (

   Following their rescue and return to
   New Athos
   , the Athosians were left nearly extinct and below genetic viability as a people. The Wraith stopped returning to feed on them due to the fact that
   Guide
   made New Athos off-limits to the Wraith rather than come into conflict with the Atlantis expedition on the matter. According to Guide, the Athosians have now been culled so badly that they aren't worth a fight over. However, with the rise of Queen

    Torren
