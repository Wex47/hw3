  <p key="e9ddcbac-4a68-41ae-be06-79887ed48960">
   During the first stages of these negotiations, the Aschen, who had no
   Iris
   to protect their Stargate, and were therefore extremely vulnerable, were hesitant to share the address of their homeworld with Earth. Because no one at the SGC knew the identity of the inhabitants of P4C-970, or had the address to the Aschen homeworld, they didn't immediately make the connection between the advanced people and the mysterious note they had received a year earlier. When they deduced that P4C-970 was one of four worlds close enough to the Volian gate to avoid the problem of stellar drift, the SGC suspected the Aschen as being the race they had been warned of, and began sending teams and probes in search for confirmation. The United States government, on the other hand- particularly Senator
   Robert Kinsey
   - had high hopes for these negotiations and subsequently prevented the SGC from continuing their search, Kinsey even suggesting that the original 'warning' was just an attempt by O'Neill to prevent Kinsey being the one to make the deal that would save Earth.

Having contaminated the Pack's agricultural crops and provided a prominent member of the Pack with a new version of the sterility pathogen, the Aschen intended for Earth to be decimated by the pathogen and thus conquer it once the population was low enough. However, a team from the future that would result if this plan succeeded- including a future version of Jack O'Neill, his daughter
   Jade
   , and a
   Reetou
   - revealed that the pathogen would mutate to the point where entire planets would become completely incapable of supporting life, with human life facing extinction by 2033 as a result of the Aschens' actions. With the aid of their future visitors, the SGC were able to undermine the Aschen plan for revenge, destroying Mirris's ship and exposing her ally among the pack, although the planned alliance was now merely the SGC providing the Pack with a new planet to live on after most of their fleet was destroyed by the Aschen.
