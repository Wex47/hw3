   The Tok'ra were first spawned by
   Egeria
   , a
   Goa'uld Queen
   and former mate of
   <a href="Ra.html" key="83a424b9-96e6-4cc8-b5f1-21f8795a7756" title="Ra">
    Ra
   </a>
   . She had come to conclude that the
   Goa'uld Empire
   was too morally objectionable to continue, and mothered the Tok'ra with her mental imprint of compassion, and a belief that they should only take willing
   hosts
   . She would mother several broods of her children to take the fight against the Goa'uld. In a final act of spite, the group was named the "Tok'ra" which meant "against Ra".
  </p>
  <p key="9545e1de-9d81-43c7-a910-7480b115fd34">
   Ra would later contact the
   Ashrak
   with hunting the rogue queen down which they managed to accomplish. Ra and his Ashrak would remove the symbiote from her host and ensured that the Tok'ra's number would never increase to such magnitudes again. This would be a traumatic time to the movement whose loss of their queen would impede on their organization. Dozens of Tok'ra symbiotes would be captured and killed by the Goa'uld and almost spelt the end of their kind. Luckily, the eldest brood of Egeria led their kind into hiding where they managed to survive.

  <p key="d6b2d2ad-e1de-4884-8b9a-f6993376ac85">
   After taking stock over their situation, the Tok'ra realized they were unable to acquire military forces sufficient to counter the

However, it appears that usually the symbiote is the dominant one, or the situations they are encountered in more suits the voice and opinion of the symbiote, in the relationship. When speaking, the Tok'ra make use of their
   symbiote voice
   to show that the symbiote itself was speaking while the normal voice indicated the host was talking. (

   The Tok'ra consist of hundreds of symbiotes who were all devoted to the fall of the
   Goa'uld Empire

   Furthermore, the lack of a

   sympathetic to their cause means that the Tok'ra suffer from zero to negative population growth and the loss of any one of their number is a staggering blow. There were rare few occasions where defecting Goa'uld would be accepted into their ranks; these rebel Goa'uld would be the most infamous of the movement and would gain a title based on the battle where they revealed their betrayal.

   The Tok'ra believed that their greatest weapon against the Goa'uld was their secrecy. At the time, they believed that anything that was not beneficial to them did not warrant a breach in their security procedures. The only thing beneficial to them in forms of an alliance were either hosts or advanced technology. This made them quite practical in their way of thinking, if somewhat callous. This stance was motivated primarily from their very low population making any riskier course of action a gamble with extinction. (

   whether they were free or loyal to their masters. This was because every Tok'ra symbiote that died at the hands of the Goa'uld was slain by a serving Jaffa. This also meant that there were no Jaffa within the ranks of the Tok'ra. They also viewed the Tau'ri as a potentially dangerous element due to their independence and seemingly reckless attacks on the Goa'uld, as well as pursuit of technologies believed to be beyond their understanding. This attitude was encouraged by the sharp increase in Tok'ra fatalities following the entrance of the Tau'ri into the conflict. Selmak was eventually viewed with mistrust for joining with a Tau'ri host, as the rest of the
   Tok'ra High Council
   felt that Jacob Carter had dominated their relationship and thus held more loyalty to the Tau'ri. (

   symbiote extractor
