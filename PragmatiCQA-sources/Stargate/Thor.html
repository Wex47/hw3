   As was required for all adult Asgard, Thor entered into a decade of military service to serve his people. In this role, Thor discovered that he had not only inherited a natural aptitude from his predecessors, but that he was also comfortable in a military environment. After attending the
   military college
   on
   Hala
   , Thor became a commissioned officer in the
   Asgard fleet
   in his early fifties. After rising through the scientific ranks from engineering to command over the following two decades, Thor received command of his own ship during his third decade of service.

   , an enemy which quickly decimated the Asgard fleet. Through some quick thinking on Thor's part, however, many of the Asgard colonists' lives were able to be preserved during the first wave of the Replicator invasion. Due to his actions, Thor received a field promotion to
   commander
   while he was helping formulate a line of defense against this new and powerful enemy. Thor held this title for the following three years until the death of the previous
   Supreme Commander
   , which led to Thor's abrupt promotion to that rank; he became the youngest Asgard to hold the title, at only two hundred years of age. With this promotion came new responsibilities, as Thor was then responsible for handling all military matters for the entire Asgard fleet. (

   . Thinking that this was maybe a storehouse of Asgard weapons, the trio went in search of the Hall. Gairwyn quickly led them to another Asgard transporter and, though she informed them it was forbidden to touch the red stone which was prominent on the transporter, Jackson reached out and touched it which transported them into an underground cavern.

   After a short time, they were met by another hologram of Thor who informed them that, though they were brave to come before him, only the worthy could witness Thor's might. Gairwyn, thinking this was the real Thor, responded to the hologram but was informed by Carter that it was merely a recording. The room soon started to shake, and the first of
   Thor's tests
   was revealed as the floor dropped so that only a narrow bridge connected the trio with the other side of the room which contained another red jewel. The three tentatively made their way across, though shaking in the room caused Gairwyn to lose her balance and fall off the bridge. If not for Jackson diving back to save her, she would have fallen; it was this act of true selflessness and bravery that allowed them to pass the first test and Thor's hologram congratulated them before transporting them into the next room.

   , another with geometric shapes, and also one with pictographs. Although Jackson was able to understand the meaning behind the runes, he had no idea what the geometric shapes meant. After a short amount of time, Jackson stated that he had no idea what Thor wanted him to do. It was at this time that a hologram of Thor again appeared, telling them that there was no shame in their failure and that perhaps they simply needed more time to come of age. Jackson stepped up, however, and asked that he be allowed more time which caused the hologram to freeze in place. Looking at the runes again, he remembered that though they originally stood for ideas, in later years they represented numbers; in this case, three, fourteen, fifteen, and nine. Though he didn't think they meant anything, Carter caught on to the fact that it was
   Pi
   . Though Jackson tried to ask the hologram if it wanted them to figure out that it was Pi, he quickly realized that Pi was a Tau'ri term and so they would have to represent it somehow. Thinking, he quickly realized that they could represent it on the geometric shapes and drew a line representing the radius through the circle on the wall, revealing another red jewel.

  <p key="b893c9f4-1573-4272-a6ac-c6fb6b0b35aa">
   After pressing this jewel, the three beings were again transported into another room and finally met the real form of Thor, a being who looked much like the
   Roswell
   Greys. This hologram informed them that he was the real one they knew as Thor, and that he was the
   Supreme Commander
   of the
   Asgard fleet
   while Carter and Jackson discussed the fact that the Asgard may have visited Earth at some time in the past. He went on to say that, in the ten span since he had created the planet Cimmeria for the Cimmerians, they were the first beings to achieve the level of communication with him that they were now experiencing. Gairwyn let Thor know that it was not she who had been wise, but the Tau'ri who helped her. Though Carter initially informed her that this was just another recording, Thor contradicted her and let the group know that he was contacting them from his quarters on the

   Now that the group knew this was the real Thor, they pleaded with him to help the people of Cimmeria from the Goa'uld. They informed him of what had happened previously, allowing him to come to the conclusion that they had opened Cimmeria to attack by the

   . As such, Carter asked if Thor had any weapons which would be able to help in their fight, a question that puzzled Thor as the tests had merely been designed to see when the Cimmerians were ready to see the Asgard in their true form. He did admit, however, that the Asgard had not foreseen outside influence. Before any of them could respond, the transmission was cut off and Jackson and Carter were transported back to the surface of the planet while Gairwyn was transported up to Thor's ship. Soon afterwards, the

   descended on Cimmeria and started beaming out the Jaffa and
   pyramids
   which were being built. Before Heru'ur himself could be captured, however, he escaped through the Stargate. Meanwhile, Thor explained to Gairwyn that he was part of a race who had visited Earth often and were protectors and friends of all save the Goa'uld. Additionally, Thor did not yet consider the Tau'ri advanced enough to communicate with the Asgard on any serious level. He did agree, however, to leave an Asgard teacher behind to help the Cimmerians rebuild. (

   Realizing that there was no longer any need to hide their true appearance from the Cimmerians,
   Hermod
   was assigned to the planet Cimmeria as their Asgard teacher while Thor went back to his duties as Supreme Commander. Despite their distance, Hermod kept in contact with Thor from his dwellings on the planet. Though his meeting with the Tau'ri was brief, his interest was piqued enough that he shared with the rest of the Asgard just how quickly these Tau'ri were advancing. (

   <a href="Protected Planets Treaty.html" key="66cb6bb2-6662-4250-9a8d-5974148d5a1c" title="Protected Planets Treaty">

   </a>
   , meaning that the System Lords would no longer be allowed to attack Earth on fear of retribution from the Asgard. Though O'Neill first asked if they could simply be given some Asgard ships, he soon agreed to the Protected Planets Treaty and was transported back to Earth.

   As such, Thor invited the System Lords to Earth to start the negotiations. Afterwards, he transported himself into

Thor then informed the Tau'ri that three representatives of the System Lords would arrive on the planet in four days, and that he wished O'Neill to represent the Tau'ri in the discussions. O'Neill tried to convince Thor to let

   lead the negotiations, as he had more experience in that field, but Thor stated that O'Neill was the chosen representative of the Asgard. Thor then transported himself out of the SGC and forwarded the Tau'ri a message briefing them on each System Lord that would be present;

   ; stating that the latter was the most likely to favor the treaty. On Thor's orders, all weaponry was removed from the SGC and lavish—though temporary—living quarters were set up for the Goa'uld who would be attending.
  </p>
  <p key="6db337d9-ff73-4fb5-8afb-dc8460f21e4e">
   Thor remained on his ship until the negotiations started, at which point he transported himself—along with his seat—into the meeting room. After offering the greetings and thanks of the
   Asgard High Council
   to all present for the chance to negotiate a peace, the negotiations were started. The Goa'uld, however, were quick to argue in their
   <a href="Goa'uld language.html" key="62bd8be2-3256-49b4-9278-3375d5e15e73" title="Goa'uld language">

   </a>
   and so O'Neill spoke up, asking that everyone present spoke the same language. This brought an abrupt halt to the negotiations, as he had spoken out of turn, and so the three System Lords left the room. Thor informed O'Neill of his mistake, though O'Neill was confused as to what he had done wrong as they were already arguing amongst themselves.
  </p>
  <p key="4cb98bf6-7ace-48be-8e6c-9bdbdc781ddd">
   It was only then that O'Neill questioned why the Asgard had not simply put a stop to the Goa'uld before they had managed to acquire as much power as they then possessed. Thor answered that the Asgard were not proud that they had been forced to ignore the situation for so long, but that there were other concerns facing the Asgard such as another enemy in their

   which were far worse than the Goa'uld, though he could not explain the situation any further. Jackson, having entered the room previously, asked what would happen if a rogue Goa'uld such as
   <a href="Sokar.html" key="662608a7-f1c3-4598-859a-d9239f403416" title="Sokar">

   </a>
   attacked Earth, to which Thor responded that the System Lords would have to prevent it to maintain the Treaty. Thor then revealed that, should a single Goa'uld ever gain dominance over the System Lords, the Asgard may not be in a position to stop them; effectively, the Asgard were bluffing the Goa'uld. O'Neill picked up on the fact and, though he questioned it, Thor was unable to answer before he had to leave. Before doing so, however, he left an
   Asgard communicator
   with O'Neill and informed them that both the Asgard and the Tau'ri may have to give up quite a lot for the negotiations to be successful.
  </p>
  <p key="fffde545-412f-4540-a127-351b1322f51b">
   After O'Neill signed an apology letter which was written by Jackson, the negotiations were once again started and so Thor beamed back down into the meeting room. Immediately upon starting, Thor informed the Goa'uld that—as per addendum 10815 of the Treaty—the Asgard would give the Goa'uld access to the
   Passage of Nilor
   in exchange for Earth's inclusion in said Treaty. Yu rebutted that, as per Treaty law section 326, no civilization was allowed to advance to a point technologically where they were a threat to the Goa'uld. Nirrti added that the definition of this point rested solely in the hands of the System Lords, a point which Thor confirmed. O'Neill questioned this rule, however, as he did not believe the Goa'uld should be able to limit the Tau'ri's development. Though the System Lords accepted Thor's proposal, they demanded an additional concession; that Earth give up both of its
   <a href="Stargate.html" key="d16cc2ad-620c-4cd9-a9ee-c398c57801b4" title="Stargate">

   immediately. At this time, the negotiations were put on hiatus until the Tau'ri made a decision, and Thor once again returned to his ship.
  </p>
  <p key="075e5360-713d-4fa5-8587-79b21f800af3">
   Before the Tau'ri were able to reach a decision, however, O'Neill used the communication device to be transported up to Thor's ship to ask for his opinion. Thor stated, however, that it was their decision without offering any help. When O'Neill asked him if the Asgard sometimes spoke between the lines, he did not get a definite answer but instead was questioned by Thor, who asked what O'Neill thought his people should do. O'Neill informed Thor that he was unsure, as it was too much for one person to decide the fate of the entire planet, though on the other hand it was obvious; they had to give up their Stargates or be destroyed. O'Neill rebutted, however, that there was always the possibility that the Goa'uld could call the Asgard bluff and attack Earth anyway, and so they would be giving up their only means of finding an effective defense; a point which Thor conceded. Though O'Neill asked for any sort of hint that there might be another way around the situation, Thor simply informed him that it was his planet at stake and that he was sure O'Neill had it within him to come to the correct decision. Feeling defeated, O'Neill simply asked Thor to send him back.

   were found injured; the former, fatally. Because of this, the remaining System Lords called off the negotiations and denied Earth access into the Protected Planets Treaty. O'Neill once again beamed up to Thor's ship, where Thor stated that they would have to let the Goa'uld leave or the remaining System Lords would attack Earth anyway. He then informed O'Neill that, at the request of the Asgard High Council, he had to leave Earth's orbit and return to his people. Though this displeased O'Neill, he was unable to stop Thor from leaving. Before going, Thor let O'Neill know that the Asgard were sympathetic to the Tau'ri's plight, but they were unable to do anything without starting a much larger war against the Goa'uld which they would be unable to win at that time. With that, O'Neill was transported back to Earth and Thor's ship left. Despite all the complications, and without Thor's help, the Tau'ri were eventually able to finish complete the negotiations without losing their Stargates after Major Carter was able to save Cronus with a healing device and the SGC proved that Teal'c had been framed for the attack by Nirrti. After this assistance, Lord Yu affirmed that the Goa'uld would permit Earth to retain their Stargates, with the understanding that any SG teams found on other planets would be freely attacked even if Earth itself was now off-limits.

   aboard his ship, though this time he did not meet O'Neill upon arrival. Instead, O'Neill was met by Replicators who were attracted to the sudden energy surge from the transporter, though O'Neill himself was of no interest to them. O'Neill soon started to search the ship and, when he called out for Thor, he was answered by Thor's voice which gave him directions on where to find his body. Upon entering the room, O'Neill discovered Thor's body in a

   ; there, Thor explained to O'Neill that his body was dying, though when O'Neill asked what happened, Thor simply stated that it was a long story. Thor then explained why he could not have transported O'Neill directly to the room they currently occupied, also informing O'Neill that the "bugs" he had seen were the enemy of the Asgard. Thor then informed O'Neill that all the information he needed was contained within the stones which were sitting on a computer console nearby before passing out.

   O'Neill, not knowing what else to do, used the stones which caused a recording of Thor to be played that explained the situation in further detail. This recording of Thor informed O'Neill that, after the Replicators boarded his ship, they accessed its computer which contained information on Earth and thus plotted a course to the planet. The recording then told O'Neill how he had sabotaged the outbound transporters after beaming his own crew off the ship in the hopes of preventing the Replicators from escaping, though he had decided to stay on the ship in the hopes of stopping it from reaching Earth. It then stated that, should O'Neill be watching the recording, then he had failed and likely doomed O'Neill to a certain death as well due to the fact that he could not beam off the ship. The recording went on to tell O'Neill that the Replicators planned to land the ship and infest Earth if O'Neill could not stop them. Due to this, O'Neill planned to blow up the ship using explosives which he was able to beam up from

   Once the trio returned to Thor, they found him in a conscious state though he was most displeased that they had transported up to the ship too as it then meant certain death for all three of them. Carter disputed the fact, however, stating that they had a
   Space shuttle
   ready on Earth which would be able to pick them up if they transferred their coordinates to
   NASA
   . Accepting this as a possible escape, Thor informed them that the pod he was in could generate an anti-gravity field which would make it easy to move. Carter then asked him if the ship had an
   airlock
   that the shuttle could connect to, which Thor replied to in the affirmative. However, when O'Neill revealed his plan—to plant some
   PBX
   on the ship and then escape—Thor informed them that the ship was equipped with an internal dampening field which would cause the explosion to do no harm. His plan defeated, O'Neill asked Thor how he had expected them to destroy the ship; Thor replied that, had he known a fast and simple method to do so, he would have done so himself before endangering their lives. He did inform them, however, that the technical specifications for the
   <i key="4f790bb4-f086-4a6c-ab8d-9664df4e3abf">

   were contained within the recordings he had made for O'Neill.
  </p>
  <p key="f7025513-09c1-4f66-a7ec-68245b6f51b2">
   Carter's interest was immediately piqued and so O'Neill showed her how to access the information with the stones. While Carter was listening to the technical specifications, O'Neill informed her that he had lost interest near the start. In contrast to O'Neill's decision, Carter decided to listen to all of the recordings before making any new plans. In addition to this, the three members of SG-1 asked Thor himself for more information on the Replicators; Thor informed them that they had discovered the Replicators on an isolated planet in their home galaxy, and brought them aboard their ship for study. He went on to tell them that the Replicators had learned from the means that were employed to stop them, stating that it was the Asgard's overconfidence in their technology which had been their undoing, before going on to tell them that the Replicators had become a plague which was annihilating everything in its path. When O'Neill asked why the Replicators hadn't simply landed the ship, Thor replied that it was due to the fact that the odds of them surviving in any new environment depended entirely upon their numbers; they were currently eating the ship to form new Replicators, an action they would continue to do until they risked compromising the integrity of the hull at which point they would land. After Thor explained more on the Replicator's hive mind and their goals, Carter picked up on the fact that they wouldn't compromise the hull, asking if the ship could withstand an uncontrolled entry into a planets atmosphere. When Thor informed her that the heat from such an action would cause the ship to burn up, she had a new plan; they would crash the ship into the atmosphere.
  </p>
  <p key="8718675d-2362-47a6-b6a6-e3c11cdd44b7">
   However, Thor told them that they would first have to gain control of the navigation computer which could only be accessed from the bridge of the ship. Carter's plan then evolved so that she and Thor would direct O'Neill and Teal'c to the bridge using a map which was contained within Thor's recordings. While O'Neill and Teal'c made their way to the bridge, Carter asked Thor questions about the map, discovering that flashing areas were those that the Replicators had disabled and that the first thing Replicators did when they entered an Asgard ship was disable the sensors capable of detecting them which only made SG-1's job harder. While answering her questions, however, Thor's health continued to deteriorate. Though he required the use of the ships automated medical facilities, he knew that if the Replicators had tampered with them then they would most likely kill him. Though Carter offered to use her experience and supplied to help, Thor stated that she could not help him.
  </p>
  <p key="a33b686f-96b0-4e4d-8cc1-5bbcf635bd4b">
   When Teal'c and O'Neill reached the bridge, they discovered that it was completely infested with Replicators and so decided that they needed a new plan. Though Thor knew that he could activate his pod, putting him into a deep stasis that would save his life, he refused to allow SG-1 to do so as he wished to remain conscious long enough to help them. After O'Neill returned, he argued the point with Thor as they wanted to save his life. Halfway through his argument, however, he mentioned getting off the ship which sparked an idea within Carter's mind; she quickly asked Thor if there were dampening fields outside the ship which would prevent explosion. When Thor replied in the negative, and also informed them that anything placed within the ships shield would make the shields ineffective, Carter devised a plan to place explosives outside the deceleration drive which controlled re-entry. Thor confirmed that the
   explosive device
   they had brought, which had been enhanced with elementary

  <p key="3208f903-3e0f-42d0-bdfe-6e5344fc92eb">
   Thor's health continued to deteriorate, however, and halfway through the plan he became so ill that he could no longer communicate. After his pod started to issue warning signals, Carter finally pressed the button which placed him into stasis so that his life could be saved. No longer able to escape on the shuttle if their plan was to succeed, Carter instead thought of the idea to transport the Stargate aboard the ship so that they could escape to another planet once they set off the explosive device. SG-1's plan was ultimately successful, and they were able to escape with Thor's body to

   After getting Thor out of his stasis pod, and seemingly going to the planet
   P4X-234
   for unknown reasons, Thor was picked up by his people and his body was restored to health. This Thor soon returned to Earth—this time through the Stargate as the Asgard had no ships to spare—to ask for more help in the Asgard's ongoing fight against the Replicators. He was greeted by the recently returned SG-1 who informed him that not all of the Replicators had been destroyed and, although they asked for his help with the matter, he was unable to provide it. He soon informed them that his home world was being threatened by the Replicators and, rather than being able to help them, he needed their help as the Asgard had been unable to stop them. Because the Tau'ri's projectile weapons had been able to fatally damage the Replicators, and indeed their strategy had proven more successful than the Asgard's own, Thor and his people had decided that the Replicator's weakness may be found through an approach which was less sophisticated than their own. Because the Asgard were no longer capable of thinking in such a way, he requested that the Tau'ri come up with a strategy to stop the Replicators from reaching
   Othala
   . Carter soon agreed to go, and though O'Neill thought that Carter may not be "dumb" enough, Thor used an Asgard hand device to activate Earth's Stargate and return with her to Othala.

   On Othala, Thor showed Carter the Asgard's last great hope of stopping the Replicator threat; the

   ; a new form of warship named after Jack O'Neill. Informing her that it was the most advanced piece of Asgard technology, and indeed was the first Asgard vessel designed solely to fight against the Replicators, he reluctantly added that the ship was not yet ready to do battle, answering Carter's query as to why they weren't simply taking it to fight the Replicators. After informing Carter that there were currently five Asgard vessels engaged with three Replicator-controlled vessels, Thor informed Carter that they were going to join the battle with the hopes of stopping it with her help. The two soon left the planet on a

  <p key="fec51571-1eba-4951-b031-354dc0cbc74d">
   While en route Thor further explained to Carter how the Replicators worked, telling her each individual block was able to form a reactive modulating, monopolar energy field on the other blocks allowing the Replicators to form into any shapes they wished. He went on to inform her that, to the Asgard's knowledge, the interior of each individual block contained two million isolated Keron pathways. Carter quickly responded that she was unaware as to what a
   Keron
   was and so Thor explained that, in the most simplest terms, it was an energy particle. Carter then asked how she was supposed to help defeat a Keron-based technology when she didn't even know what a Keron was. Thor simply responded that the Asgard would never have imagined inventing a weapon which propelled small weights of
   iron
   and
   carbon
   alloys by means of igniting a powder of
   potassium nitrate
   ,
   charcoal
   , and
   sulfur
   . This ambiguous response was enough for Carter, who got Thor's point that the Asgard were unable to think like the Tau'ri did. Carter then tried to put the Replicators into terms she could understand, with Thor replying that her simplification was correct.
  </p>
  <p key="cf3e31ff-d494-49db-9da5-5ba22929b994">
   When asked if the Asgard kept any Replicators on board so that she could study them, Thor replied in the negative and informed her that to do so would be too dangerous. Remembering that she herself had two Replicator blocks back in her lab, Carter then asked if one or two blocks could start replicating. When Thor again replied in the negative, Carter was relieved as it meant that she had not doomed the SGC. To help in Carter's understanding of the Replicators, Thor called up a hologram which acted just like the real Replicators; at least as far as the Asgard had observed. Carter spent some time studying the hologram, though she was eventually distracted by thoughts of her colleagues back on Earth who were also facing the Replicators. When Thor noticed, he assured Carter that O'Neill was a very capable

   and so she should not worry. He then promised that, should they be able to stop the invasion of Othala, he would do all he could to help Earth from their threat. Before the two started work again, Thor asked Carter if she would like to eat; when Carter replied that she would, he transported in some
   Asgard food
   , stating that he liked the yellow ones.
  </p>
  <p key="b5e860c2-5e11-4f32-9d87-c6f237e7c0e4">
   While Carter was trying the food, which she did not like the taste of, Thor was contacted by another Asgard who informed him that they had lost contact with the rest of the Asgard ships which were previously engaged with the Replicator-controlled ships. When Carter asked if it could be a simple communications problem, Thor replied that it could not as none of the Asgard ships were even being detected on their sensors, meaning that they had been destroyed. Instead, the only ships that could be detected were the three Replicator-controlled ships. Thor's ship soon caught up with the Replicators, though rather than engage them in combat it simply moved in behind them and followed their course. Carter then asked him how long it would be before they reached his planet and, when Thor replied that it would be two hours, Carter inquired as to why it would take so long. Thor then informed her that, in order for the ships to generate the subspace field which was required to fly at hyperspeed, the full power of the
   neutrino-ion generators
   were required. The Replicators, however, were using the power created by those generators to replicate which meant they could not travel at full speed. Thor went on to explain that the Replicators did not care about time as they did, and so they were in no rush to get to the planet.
  </p>
  <p key="82d7595a-ca38-48af-9215-f76488f5ab46">
   When asked by Carter how the Replicators had managed to board Asgard ships in the first place, Thor informed her that they were able to modify Asgard technology to a point that was beyond even the Asgard's understanding. Carter was unsure how this could happen, as she had assumed they gained all their knowledge from the Asgard to which Thor replied that it was possible they had gained their knowledge from other sources also. Carter then inquired as to why the Replicator ships had not simply attacked them, as surely they would be able to destroy Thor's ship. Thor replied that this was for two reasons, the first being that they had shown no signs of aggression and the second was that Thor's ship was far less advanced than the ones the Replicators currently controlled and so they had no need to either take it over or destroy it.

   Carter soon became fatigued, however, which Thor noticed and pointed out as another advantage the Replicators had over them; they did not require rest. Carter picked up on that, pointing out that though they did not have to sleep, the Replicators did have to eat, with Thor adding the addendum that this was to replicate. Carter then asked Thor what the hardest substance he knew of was, which he informed her was a
   carbon

   <i key="cf3cbcc4-79d8-4156-a60e-cf8214d54959">
    O'Neill
   </i>
   —due to it being the most advanced piece of technology they knew of—and then explode it so that it would take out the Replicator-controlled ships. Thor was worried about this plan, both because the Replicators could simply capture the ship and consume its technology and because he did not wish to give up the Asgard's most advanced ship. Carter was able to convince him of the plan, however, by stating that it would be destroyed or captured anyway if they did nothing and coupling it with the fact that it was a plan the Asgard would never think of which was exactly why they had asked her to come and help.
  </p>
  <p key="eeb05e5b-372c-4351-9367-a0f00b1449e7">
   Convinced, Thor transported away to put the plan into action before transporting back to his ship to see if the plan succeeded. Back on his ship with Carter, the two watched as the

   left the planet and, after a few harrowing seconds, the Replicator-controlled vessels chased after it. Following the chase through the Asgard sensors, the two watched as the

   exploded and took the Replicator-controlled ships with it; Carter's plan was successful. Carter, pleased, leaned down to hug Thor but quickly apologized as she realized she may have hurt him. He was fine, however, and thanked Carter for her "stupid idea" which made her smile. The two then headed back to Earth so that Thor could fulfill his promise of helping Earth, but when they arrived all that was left to do was transport O'Neill and Teal'c out of a sinking
   submarine
   before the Replicators could overrun them. Thor informed the three members of SG-1 that the Asgard were grateful for their help, and that they would one day help the Tau'ri in their fight against the Goa'uld. He went on to explain that, though they had saved a single Asgard planet, they had won but a small victory in the overall war against the Replicators. O'Neill offered to let Thor come to their planet any time, though when he offered to let Thor come
   fishing
   he was transported away and Thor's ship left the planet. (

   Heimdall
   , they discovered Thor's true status, as the prisoner of Osiris. Heimdall informed them that, before they could leave the planet, they had to rescue Thor as his life was in great danger. At the same time, on Osiris's ship, Osiris herself came to question Thor. Though Thor informed Osiris that he had committed an act of war against the Asgard, and so their reaction would be swift and decisive, Osiris was not threatened as she had easily destroyed Thor's ship. Thor informed Osiris that this was simply because he had underestimated the Goa'uld's advancements; a mistake which would not be made again. Osiris was not worried, however, and even boasted that next time the Goa'uld would have a further advantage, as they would have learned all of the Asgard's secrets. Thor responded by telling Osiris that he would never surrender his knowledge, and though Osiris agreed that Thor would not divulge the information to him personally, he informed Thor that Anubis himself was on his way to conduct the interrogations.

Instead, Thor ordered the group to take Heimdall and his research then leave the planet before more Goa'uld could arrive, also informing O'Neill that it was Anubis who was coming to interrogate him. Before the two could converse further, another being entered the room and so the hologram was turned off.

   ringed aboard from the planet. While the two members of SG-1 attempted to deactivate the Ha'tak's
   shield generator
   , Anubis made his way to Thor's room. Once there, Anubis introduced himself to Thor. Thor was still defiant, informing Anubis that he would reveal nothing but Anubis responded by showing Thor a
   mind probe
   which he had in his possession. Anubis explained to Thor that this device would link Thor's mind with the ship's computer, thus allowing Anubis to simply download Thor's knowledge into the ship's memory banks. Thor, unbelieving, stated that the Goa'uld did not possess this form of technology, but Anubis retorted that many things had changed since his return.

   Though Thor attempted to fight against the link, he was unsuccessful in doing so and instead attempted to gain control of the ship through the link. He soon had control of the internal communication system, using his new found abilities to speak with the recently captured O'Neill and Teal'c in their holding cell. He informed them of how his mind had been linked to the ship's computer, letting them know that he was using the communication system to synthesize his voice. He went on to say that the Goa'uld were attempting to download information from his prefrontal cortex, stating that it was but a matter of time before they were successful and broke through his mental defenses. Before this could happen, Thor used the link to rewrite some minor subroutines in the security protocol to free the members of SG-1 from their cell, though this seemingly drained him to a point that he could no longer communicate.

O'Neill informed him, however, that this option was unacceptable and so the group tried to leave the planet. Before they were able to, however, they were fired on by one of the Ha'tak's which disabled their

As these ships were far superior to the one that Osiris had previously destroyed, Anubis' forces left the planet and Thor was taken back to the Asgard where the mind probe was removed from his body. The device had already done considerable damage, however, and had caused Thor to lapse into a coma. In order to help him, the Asgard studied the mind probe in the hopes of learning how it worked though it was unlike anything they had previously encountered. (

Though O'Neill at first questioned how it could be Thor aboard the ship, as they had rescued him months ago, Samantha reminded him that Anubis had first been able to download Thor's mind into the computer core. Because Thor's real body was in a coma—and indeed the Asgard had informed the Tau'ri that he may not last much longer—Samantha decided that they had to download this consciousness from the ship's computer core so that the Asgard could transfer it into a new
   clone
   body. Davis argued, however, that if Thor truly was in control of the ship then he was the only thing keeping the self-destruct on hold. Because there was seventeen minutes left on the countdown—more than enough time to escape—and due to the fact that the ship could never fly again anyway, the group decided to extract Thor's mind.
