   The fact that the Lucian Alliance has managed to form a coherent group makes them unique among the scattered humans in the
   Milky Way
   , but this alliance is not without its weaknesses. As its ranks are comprised largely of mercenaries, smugglers, and other criminals, its leadership is tenuous at best, with much dissatisfaction within the ranks. Members live dangerous lives, prone to being killed for failure, or simply when a rival desires their territory (in this respect, they are much like the Goa'uld). The Alliance rules with fear and intimidation, and punish defiance with swift retribution.
