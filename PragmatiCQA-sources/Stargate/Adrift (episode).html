   With only 24 hours of power left,

   and is helplessly drifting through space, while the

   Stargate satellite
   to attack the city. The beam was quickly depleting
   Atlantis' shield

   tried to submerge the city, but beam was not weaken enough. Their next plan was to bring an
   Asteroid
   to block the beam and allow Atlantis to use the
   Stardrive
   to leave the planet. However, in the process the beam grazed the side of the central tower. Due to this, the city dropped out of
   hyperspace
   early, and are now drifting in the middle of nowhere, with 24 hours of power left, and no hope of calling for help, or re-engaging the Stardrive.

   works furiously to restore the

   Subspace communications

   defibrillator
   , which brings her back to life. Back in the control room, McKay tells

   A while later, Sheppard approaches McKay, and tells him that since Weir is incapacitated, Sheppard is in charge, and wants McKay to keep him in the loop. McKay tells him that he deployed some teams to patch up the damaged conduits. They have made significant progress in fixing them, and they would have at least an extra hour of power. However, an alarm sounds. They discover that the
   shield
   is collapsing, and McKay can't stop it. Sheppard warns a team led by
   Matthews
   to finish the work and escape to the central tower. The team attempts to do so, however, the shield is collapsing too quickly. The team almost makes it, but the
   artificial gravity
   shuts down, and the shield passes the helpless team. In the control room, the team watches helplessly, as they see the bio signatures fade away. Sheppard orders the other teams not to take too long.

   brain
   is swelling and if it continues, then they have to perform a
   decompressive craniectomy

   Radek Zelenka
   is making excellent progress, by using secondary conduits to patch up the damaged ones. Sheppard then pops into the infirmary, where Keller gives him a diagnostic of Weir's condition; she has six broken
   ribs
   , one of which punctured a lung, but no spinal damage. However, her head got knocked around badly, causing substantial brain damage. Meaning that even if she will revive, she'll never be the same Elizabeth again. This news puts Sheppard on an uneasy position.

   In the
   ZPM room
   , Zelenka tells McKay they will soon finish repairs to send Atlantis to M12-578. However, there's a problem, the city is on a collision course with an
   asteroid
   belt, which leaves them an ultimatum. If they take the shields back to its original shape, the power drain would lose any chance of restoring the stardrive. If they remain, the city would fall apart. With the
   Chair room
   out of reach of the shield, Sheppard has one plan left. He calls in everyone with the
   Ancient Technology Activation gene
   to fly

   The pilots start firing
   Drone weapons
   into the asteroids. Despite little experience, the pilots managed to have wiped out several asteroids. After the halfway point, McKay and two more Jumpers pick off some stragglers, particularly the big asteroid about to hit Atlantis, which is intercepted by McKay. The other Jumpers make it through and return to pick off the stragglers. In Atlantis, they feel the effects of some smaller pieces hitting Atlantis. The city sustains multiple hits, but went through the field, putting everyone into relief. The Jumpers return, with McKay's shock that the plan worked. However, he is called to more bad news; some of the asteroids that made it through Atlantis has damaged some of the stardrive's
   control crystals
   . They have to repair it.

   There is a catch, the crystals are outside the shield, meaning they would have to make it there in
   space suits
   , and would have to work fast, before the power levels will dip too low to get the stardrive online again. Sheppard and Zelenka ready their space suits. Meanwhile, McKay gets a visit from Keller, who gave him an idea to get Weir back to her original self, by reactivating the
   nanites
   she was infected with by
   Niam
   a
   year ago
   . McKay tells Sheppard about the plan, only to tell him not to, since Weir wouldn't want that to happen. However, McKay works on a plan to reprogram them in a way that it will not be a threat to her.

   Sheppard and Zelenka walk through the exposed hallways. However, on the way, they find a big gap between them and the control crystals. Sheppard plans on a space jump, by pushing Zelenka and using his inertia to pull Sheppard across the gap. It works and Zelenka starts on replacing the damaged crystals. However, a micro-asteroid cuts through Zelenka's uniform and through one of his legs. However, Zelenka insists on continuing.

   In the infirmary, Ronon comes up to Weir and thanks her for letting him in Atlantis, because he would be dead if he carried on as a
   runner
   . However, her vitals spike. Keller pushes Ronon away and tells McKay to activate the nanites or she'll die. Despite not being finished, McKay gives her the activation codes.

   Zelenka finishes replacing the crystals. However, when Sheppard tells
   Teyla Emmagan
   , she tells them that the power levels have dropped below the minimum level required to jump. They have 30 hours before the shields completely fails, which will kill them all. But there's another problem; Sheppard finds out about Weir, and snaps at McKay. He orders him to terminate the nanites, which McKay refuses. But Weir has just awakened from her coma and wonders what is going on. They put the room Weir is in placed in quarantine. Weir tells Teyla that reactivating the nanites is a bad idea, as they have no idea what she went through last time.

   Back in Atlantis, the team tries to figure out an alternate plan to save Atlantis. Zelenka proposes they override the city safeguards and try to activate the hyperdrive with their available power. However, doing so means there is a 50/50 chance the hyperdrive will either work, or destroy the city. Sheppard rejects the plan as it is too dangerous and insists they try something else. McKay and Zelenka then realize they can use the hyperspace-capable Jumper that McKay designed when he was
   once physically augmented
   . Though it can't travel very far, the Jumper does have enough power to jump to a nearby planet and return. McKay and Zelenka plan to take the Jumper to a nearby planet. On the screen, McKay finds

    Contrary to the popular movie and TV trope, asteroid fields are not nearly as dense as depicted otherwise the asteroids would have pulverized each other millions of years ago. Additionally the effects of gravity work in favor of fewer bodies with bigger individual masses that are more spread out in space. Small asteroids and "space dust" will coalesce into/rain down onto a big object over time. In our own solar system the average distance between the bigger asteroids are on the order of
    <i key="5fec6032-f625-467d-a0ea-dbce284cb2a0">
     millions

    Additionally, the odds of Atlantis randomly dropping out of hyperspace anywhere NEAR any asteroid/planet/star are quite literally astronomical. Space is really, REALLY empty. Like, if two hefty spiral galaxies collided face-to-face, the odds of any star/planet colliding with another would be essentially zero. And if the city really WERE to face such an encounter, the odds of the city and asteroids apparently having very little difference in their relative velocities is equally nonsensical. If the city is indeed moving too quickly through space for the Stargate to calibrate, it must be moving significantly greater than the Earth's orbital speed of 30 kilometers PER SECOND. And it is shown to be heading towards the belt perpendicularly, so it can't be "gaining" on the asteroids, as if they were moving in the same direction. However, during the Jumper scene, the asteroids are apparently moving only a few miles per hour, in relation to the city.

    When Sheppard goes out to fix the
    hyperspace
    array, he can hear several of the micro-asteroids tearing through the city. However, given that they are in open space, he should not hear any noise at all, although it is a well-established trope that in television shows and films it's to be expected that they'll ignore this fact for the sake of entertainment value, and avoiding whole stints of silent scenes in a series that involves itself in an intergalactic expedition.
