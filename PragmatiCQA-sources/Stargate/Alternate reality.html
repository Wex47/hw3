    Alternate realities
   </b>
   , or parallel universes, are a concept that stems from
   Hugh Everett
   's
   many-worlds interpretation
   of
   quantum mechanics
   . It is believed there are an infinite number of different realities, some more similar than others. Sometimes there are the same people, places, and objects, but with notable differences.

   In a
   multiverse
   , there exist a near-infinite number of universes, or realities, that are each created to reflect a different outcome to a decision. One could use the fork in the road as an analogy, where going in one direction defines the individual's current reality, whereas the roads not taken represent the alternate realities. These realities are progressing through time at the same rate as ours, but different paths are being taken, thus the term
   parallel universes
   is also used to describe them. Additional terms for

As long as the link between the two realities was maintained, a traveler could go back and forth, but if the Mirror was turned off, the traveler would have to use a control device in their current reality to find the reality from which they had originally traveled. The method of determining the correct reality was purely by visual confirmation through the Mirror, as neither the Mirror nor its remote control seemed to record the placement of the originating reality or the last reality dialed.

   discharged in the wormhole connected to the original point of origin's corresponding Stargate. Because the Stargate's wormhole was used to create the "inter-universal bridge," travel was only one-way, or uni-directional. (

   Rodney McKay
   of this reality apparently met another alternative version of Sheppard in a situation similar to when Rod came to Atlantis. However, this reality is distinct from Rod's reality and it was not our reality's Sheppard that this version of Rodney met. When a
   Hive ship
   attempted an attack on Earth, it was quickly destroyed by the powerful
   Drone weapons
   of the
   Antarctic outpost
   . One of the
   Wraith Darts
   was shot down by a squad of
   F-302 fighter-interceptors
   and so ignored by the drones. The pilot survived and pretended to be human to try to send a signal to the
   Wraith
   in
   Pegasus
   to rescue him.

   Control chair
