As the population of the world grew more fearful of Reese and the Replicators, she began to teach the machines to protect her and themselves. In order to accomplish this, they began the process of self replication. The Replicators grew too large in number, and Reese herself began to lose the ability to control them. After Reese lost control of the Replicators, they destroyed her world and everyone living on it. The Replicators abandoned Reese in pursuit of raw materials, and Reese, feeling guilty and abandoned, went to sleep. She was later discovered by

Once the blocks were brought together, they started replicating and infested the ship and the Asgard were unable to control them.  The Replicators then took control of the ship and set course for the Ida galaxy.  In a last ditch effort to stop the Replicators from reaching their home world the Asgard destroyed their ship but some blocks managed to survive and reached a planet. Without any further raw materials to replicate they deactivated themselves and waited.  At some point, the

   explored that planet and uncovered the deactivated Replicator blocks. Since they had no prior knowledge of the Replicators they would have assumed that the Replicators were created in their galaxy and that the creators have been destroyed by the Replicators. During the study of the machines, the Replicator blocks activated and began to assimilate
   Asgard technology
   , which allowed them to spread throughout the Asgard's galaxy; given that they had prior knowledge of Asgard technology they would have spread quite quickly and overwhelmed the Asgard. The Replicators then became a plague that destroyed everything in its path. This resulted in the
   Asgard-Replicator war
   , which kept the Asgard's attention contained in their own galaxy as they attempted to defeat this robotic menace. (

   Eventually, the Replicators began taking over Asgard vessels and the Asgard's tactics proved to be ineffective as the Replicators were fast learning machines. This meant that all attempts by the Asgard at defeating them meant that the Replicators simply grew more advanced by learning from the machines that were used against them. As a result, the Replicators began to close on the Asgard planet

   , the Asgard took the android in order to find a weakness in the Replicators. Unfortunately, they were incapable of finding such a critical piece of information. Instead, they hatched upon a plan at containing the Replicator menace. Triggering an activation signal, the entire mechanical horde raced toward the Asgard planet
   Hala
   where a
   Time dilation field
   was activated which threatened to trap the Replicators indefinitely. However, the Replicators at this point managed to recover Reese and studied her form realizing that there were elements in her makeup that were superior to their own. This in turn led the Replicators to create
   Human-form Replicators
   which were composed of microscopic
   Nanite
   blocks. The
   First
   of these new intelligent Replicators was capable of piercing the Asgard
   Time dilation device

   Fifth
   to betray his kin and he activated the Asgard time dilation device though he was betrayed in the process leaving the Replicators trapped frozen in time. (

With the Replicators controlling his body, he seemed to have much more strength and resistance to attacks. Mitchell and Marrick fought for some time until at one point when Mitchell pulled one of the Replicator's legs out of Marrick's back. While this was happening, Marrick was released from their control and spoke to Michell telling him of how the Replicators took him to get to the "self-destruct" code which he managed to reveal was on the other side of the crystal used to create them. Right after this, the Replicators retook control over his body, and he resumed attacking Mitchell until eventually Mitchell electrocuted him using a wire on the wall and stumbled out into the hallway while Marrick was stunned. During this time, several soldiers were fighting off a large number of Replicators who were trying to break through to the Asgard computer core. While this was happening, the

   . Mitchell finally detonated the explosive after he saw Marrick walking out of the room toward him. However, this did not stop the Replicators; from the body's ashes, Replicator blocks arose in the form of a human skeleton and moved toward Mitchell. At the same time, the Replicators began to break through the ceiling of the Asgard core room. Shortly before, Carter retrieved the self-destruct program from the opposite side of the control crystal that Marrick used to create it and activates it. Right as the skeleton Replicator reached Mitchell, it -along with all of the rest of the Replicators- disassembled, finally ending the Replicator threat. (

   Each Replicator is composed of a series of Replicator blocks. Each block is made up of many
   Keron
   pathways. It takes several blocks working together to make new blocks. Replicators are capable of forming many patterns determined by what they need to accomplish. Although Replicators usually take the form of "bugs," they can take other forms. The blocks are capable of absorbing large amounts of energy, which can empower them. The Asgard's dependence on energy weapons made it difficult for them to develop a weapon which could effectively counter the Replicator blocks.

    "Spider" Replicators

   are the basic variation of the Replicator. They are the most seen and most numerous of all the Replicators. The spider Replicators are mainly tasked with moving out and collecting raw materials to bring back to the queen for replication. They try and find the strongest material they can to increase the strength of any newly created Replicators. They are also equipped with a defensive

   Fly Replicators were encountered only once. Though they are around the same size as the spider Replicators, they have shorter limbs, and wing-like structures on their back, making them greatly resemble a fly - hence the name. Despite this, fly Replicators could not fly or jump; instead, they could crawl on walls and fall from short heights such as a table. It is unknown if they could form a queen. Fly Replicators are likely an older model of Replicator, before they 'evolved' into their current state. These were less aggressive than other forms of Replicator, but later became aggressive as they responded to the needs of their maker

Every Queen encountered was immobile, requiring the other drones to guard and supply it. (

   is looking at the code for either the Replicators or the shut down function, the code shown on the monitor is actually written in
   JavaScript
   . Apparently, it was taken from a
