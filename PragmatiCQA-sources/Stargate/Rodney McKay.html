McKay claimed to have won an award for his acting skills as a kid and could have made a career out of it, but chose not to. At some point in his childhood, he spent a few months in a scouting organization, the
   Fort McMurray Eager Beavers
   , until they asked him to leave, but he has kept the manual ever since. In grade six, McKay built a non-working

   Malcolm Tunney
   , another genius who was earning his doctorate at the same time. Though McKay claimed that he was smarter than Tunney, he always wanted to show off his success, especially to annoy him. He also once admitted to having "toked" Cannabis when he was in University and claimed he didn't feel any adverse effects, apart from itching and a desire to eat an entire loaf of white bread; on the other hand, he has said at times that he is [mortally] allergic to citrus. He has a younger sister named
   Jeannie Miller
   , who is also a talented scientist, but when she decided to start a family and de-prioritize her studies over her career, they had a massive argument and did not speak for four years before Rodney saw her again. (

   Arriving at the SGC, McKay was revealed to have been studying the Stargate Program at Area 51 for over a year and upon meeting Major Samantha Carter, became immediately infatuated with her. A conversation with her quickly turned sour when he began poking holes at the structure of the

   </a>
   , a device Carter had personally worked on and also created. Their relationship grew even more sour when Carter later realized that McKay was the one who had suggested the 48 hour deadline because he thought Teal'c was already dead, believing that the Stargate's data storage program had already degraded Teal'c's pattern so much that the Jaffa could never be restored. This triggered Carter's fury and led to her calling him a "jerk". McKay remarked, "I've always had a real weakness for dumb blondes." Carter told him to "Go suck a lemon." as an insult due to his allergy, however, he still considered her "Very sexy."

McKay came up with a solution to shut down the Stargate before Anubis used it to destroy the Earth with the Stargate destroyer. He suggested they use an
   EMP
   generator
   to shut down the gate, which ultimately was ineffective. Consequently, by opening the

   to make a "short jump" (in relative terms, which still meant a really long way) with the gate strapped to the underside of the 302. This sent the Gate far enough away that the Earth wasn't affected by the gate's explosion. Carter later kissed McKay on the cheek, which he interpreted as meaning that Carter no longer hated him. What he did in the two years prior to his departure from the SGC and then eventually joining the Atlantis Expedition remains unknown. (

McKay got annoyed when Ronon hugged Beckett in thanks, but was mollified by Ronon thanking everyone. McKay then flew the Jumper back to the

When McKay collapsed the bridge, he helped his alternate self return home. Although there is obvious friction in the relationship with Jeannie, McKay manages to reconcile his differences with her thanks to Sheppard showing her the message he recorded for her before the siege and helping McKay realize how bad of a brother he was being. McKay also learned that despite their differences, his team preferred him to his alternate self. (

   , for their perceived "lack of intellect" or imagination. His attitude is one of exasperation, wondering how it is that they can hold down a job, and yet, he is occasionally forced to admit that his colleagues are useful. However, despite his irritating demeanor, almost everyone on the Atlantis expedition is either a friend, or on friendly terms with him. He even demonstrates a certain "B team" inferiority complex when dealing with the members of SG-1, particularly Samantha Carter and Dr. Daniel Jackson.

   John Sheppard and other members of the expedition have usually shown full trust in him. An alternate McKay, who went by "Rod" has admitted that he likes McKay for the simple fact that he is able to speak his mind so freely and simply. McKay however, didn't seem to realize that people didn't like him too much because of his arrogance, when Rod stated the observation that he didn't seem to care if people liked him or not.

   near ascension
   , his behavior changed somewhat. He spent what time he thought he had left as best he could. He used his knowledge to try to create technologies to help the expedition, did things to help others personally, such as writing a book about Weir from his perspective, asked Ronon about his scars and healed them, saved Zelenka's life when he was dying, and served the remembrance tea for

   McKay is very awkward when it comes to relationships with women. However, he still claimed to have dated several women at least twice during his education years, in particular, someone named
   Teresa Geldar
   on two occasions and
   Jocelyn Rutger
   once. He also had a fondness for his neighbor, who hates him, but likes his
   cat
   , and claimed to have seen

    McKay mentioned his previous experience of cooperation with Carter on several occasions, not without a hint of vanity. When the city was under the
    Wraith siege
    and the base personnel decided to transmit an array of data to Earth, in his personal video message Rodney once again returned to discussing his sympathies towards her. Later, in
    2005
    , while he was trapped on the sunken
    Puddle Jumper
    , McKay's subconscious re-created the image of Carter in the form of hallucination wearing partly unzipped pink outfit. After the rescue he named in honor of Sam one of the
    Flagisallus
    , that supposedly was floating in circles around the crushed Jumper, which attracted attention. (
