   Greer was born to
   Angela Greer
   and
   Reginald Greer
   . His father fought in the
   Gulf War
   , and after the war was abusive as a father, locking Greer in a closet as punishment, making him stack bricks only to kick them over, and at one point leaving him in the middle of the city and forcing him to walk home. The former has given him mild
   claustrophobia
   . He saved both his mother and father from a house fire after the latter incident. His mother was presumably unharmed in the fire while his father suffered severe burns that left him with scars on one side of his face. When he was in his late teen years his father died of a brain infection while in a Veteran's Hospital. Greer joined the
   United States Marine Corps
   after he did not receive an athletic scholarship. He believed that by joining the military he could make a difference.

   said that Greer was not among the men that he had approved to be on the exploration/military teams that would go through the gate on the

   after the 9th chevron was dialed. Rush also believed that if not for the military, Greer would have gone to prison, or "worse". (

   Naquadria bomb
   threat, Wray and Greer decided to try to disarm it themselves, but discovered they were exposed to a fatal dose of radiation in the process. Evans revealed himself to be Lucian Alliance and took Wray hostage, but she broke free and Greer killed him. The two made it into the ship where Wray tried to disarm the bomb, but failed as their radio was jammed by the radiation and they weren't able to get the full instructions from
   Varro
   . Wray apologized to him for their differences, explaining that they stemmed from the fact that he was more into action while she was more into talking and the two got a laugh out of the fact that at the point where all they had to do was talk, Wray had nothing to say. After

   since their return and they didn't know what had happened to their loved ones. Greer admitted to Wray he missed his
   mother
   and was sorry as they weren't on the best of terms because of his joining the military, but Wray comforted him with the fact that his mother probably knew how he cared about her anyway. (

   Lt.

   needed to take bone marrow from him, he refused to be sedated due to a lack of medicine on board, even though it caused him great pain. When Volker got nervous about the operation and reminisced about watching the stars in his backyard, Greer took him to the

   After recovering, Greer was sent on a mission to
   a planet
   where he and
   Lt.
   Matthew Scott
   encountered a
   Space deer

   . Eventually
   Varro
   ,
   Tasia
   and the other
   Lucian Alliance
   personnel joined the hunt to Greer's displeasure as he didn't trust them. The team fell into a trap and Young and
   Lt.
   Vanessa James
   were hurt while most of the Alliance team was killed and Greer admitted to James his reasons for hesitating so much: he thought he died during the operation even though James figured it was just the effets of the medicine he was under and he didn't want to ever experience that again. After laying an ambush for the creature which killed one, all of the remaining members of the team except Varro and Greer were killed, leaving the two to rescue TJ and Reynolds alone. Greer still didn't trust Varro who compared him to a friend of his who died on a
   suicide
   mission, but worked with him. After locating the two thanks to TJ fixing a radio and calling them, Greer had Varro create a distraction while he rescued the two. Even though Greer could've harmed the creature, he chose not to as it was intelligent and willing to let TJ and Reynolds go after recignizing the same about the them and they hooked up with Varro who escaped the creatures unharmed. On the way back to the Gate, the group encountered another space deer and Greer killed it to take it back to the ship for dinner. As a result of this adventure, Varro earned Greer's trust and at Greer's recommendation, Varro was set free and integrated into the crew. (
