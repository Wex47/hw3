Death defeated Waterlight in a mental battle, but was interrupted by Teyla before she could kill the young Queen. Death was shocked to learn that Teyla was Guide's queen Steelflower and the two locked in a mental battle. Teyla learned that Death was being manipulated by the ancient Wraith
   Ashes
   and begged Death to surrender, but she refused. Although Death's mind was powerful, she was undisciplined and inexperienced, whereas Teyla had greater experience and training from Guide. Teyla telepathically stopped Death's breathing, killing her when Queen Death refused to surrender. Afterwards, Teyla gave Waterlight credit for killing Death and Death's remaining forces surrendered to Waterlight and
   Alabaster
   . Her disabled hive ship was at some point later destroyed. (

Before Moonwhite executed Bell by feeding him, Bell claimed that Death had a daughter, implying that he was serving this daughter with his actions. Moonwhite informed Atlantis of this claim and they discussed the possibility that it was the truth. Though Death would almost certainly have spread the news if this had occurred before she came to power, Moonwhite suggested that it could've happened afterwards and Death may have put the embryo into stasis on one of her hives. However, both Moonwhite and the Atlantis team agreed that it was extremely unlikely and probably an attempt to get them to continue living in fear of Queen Death and her legacy. (
