   The Satedans, at the time of their annihilation, were at about the same level of development as the
   Genii
   , comparable to the WW2 era. They had not developed nuclear weapons, though the Genii did not either until after being driven underground. Their projectile weaponry was designed to inflict maximum damage; notably, a Satedan Rifle is able to take down a Wraith with greater ease than even a
   FN P90 Personal Defense Weapon
   . Along with this, Satedan soldiers were equipped with special armor, designed to dissipate energy blasts (a countermeasure against Wraith stunners). They could even shoot down
   Wraith Darts
   . Lacking interstellar spacecraft however, they were ultimately no match for the
   hive ships
   , which bombarded the planet from orbit.

   By 2009, a few Satedans had returned to Sateda, but this was mainly out of the lack of alternatives available to them, with many of the Satedans being those non-warriors whose skills did not translate well to life on less technologically developed worlds. The Genii had also come to Sateda to claim some technology, but the Atlantis expedition became involved in the Genii's actions when Ronon suggested a trip to Sateda to retrieve samples of Ancient technology from the museum. The expedition were able to negotiate for greater authority for the Satedans in exchange for being able to conduct some salvage operations, including retrieving a hyperdrive crystal and a near-depleted ZPM from the museum.

Ronon was asked to be part of it, but had no interest in being a figurehead, although a colonel from Earth contemplated retiring to Sateda when her tour of duty ended to teach them how to fly their own planes.
