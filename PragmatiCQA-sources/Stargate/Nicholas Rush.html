   Having localized the life-support problem to the air filtration system, namely the

When they return ten minutes early, Rush meets them and informs Young of their success. He also tells him that he checked Eli's calculations through the journey through the star and they were completely perfect and calls it genius, but asks Young not to tell Eli that he said that.

Initially unable to do so due to the drones blockading the only planet nearby that has what they need, Rush helps implement a plan come up with by Park to draw the drones in using a shuttle and then detonate its engines once close to destroy the Control Ship that shows up. Eli and Rush remote-pilot the shuttle and successfully destroy the Control Ship. After the pods are fixed, all but the senior staff, including Rush, enter stasis and the staff has a final dinner together. Rush is surprised when Young, while describing the crew as a family, refers to him as the "crazy uncle who always comes through." Afterwards, after all but he, Eli and Young enter stasis, Rush discovers that one pod is too badly damaged to fix in time and that one person could remain out for two weeks to try to fix it before having to shut down life-support and die. Rush volunteers, not expecting Young to allow it, but is surprised when he hears from Young that Eli has decided to do it instead. Rush is unable to convince Eli not to do it, despite admitting that Eli has great potential and hates to see it wasted and enters stasis with Young, addressing Eli as "Mr. Wallace" when saying goodbye to him.

   Though he is a brilliant and very focused scientist, Dr. Nicholas Rush seems to lack the compassion usually seen with scientists involved with the

   . Having worked his way up from being a son of a worker at the
   Glasgow
   Shipyards to an important post in a top secret program, he is convinced that he is the right person to make decisions even when the consequences affect other people. He dialed the nine-chevron address from
   Icarus Base
   while the base was under attack to avoid the blast from the planet's destruction being transferred to Earth, unaware that he would strand everyone aboard the

   Rush is not afraid of speaking his mind, even if it will be met with disapproval and cast doubt on his morals. (

   "). Although self-preservation seems to be one of Rush' dominant instincts, he often demonstrates courage and selflessness. When trapped on a planet with
   Squigglers
   about to close in on his team, Rush went through an unstable wormhole in an attempt to get help, knowing it would probably kill him. Captured by aliens, Rush used an interface device to gain the knowledge to escape the ship but delayed his escape to go back for Chloe, who had also been captured. Rush rescued her and fought off an alien that tried to recapture them. He ordered everyone to stay away from the
   Destiny interface chair
   until absolutely positive that it was safe. Franklin disobeyed Rush' order and sat in the chair, suffering grave injury. However, Rush later took the chance to sit in the chair after installing safety features that he hoped would protect him. During a lucid dream whilst using the device, Rush revealed to a dream version of
   his wife
   that he believed his morality died with her. She assured him he was still a good man. (

   Although Young tried to murder Rush by leaving him behind on a desert planet, Rush saved Young's life on at least two occasions. Once was when Young was suffering recurring dreams induced by the ship that tested his ability to command. Young was failing the test and Rush overrode Destiny's programs to save Young. Rush also saved Young's life when they were trapped on an alien spaceship. They were forced to jump from the ship back to Destiny. Rush made the jump safely but Young landed badly and started spinning off into space. Rush ran after him and caught him, pulling him to safety. Rush also put his life on the line to disarm a bomb attached to Park's back, and suggested getting the
   Nakai
   to remove
   their pathogen
   from Chloe despite the fact that it risked them learning whatever information Chloe had collected on
   <i key="37d4bdd5-3183-4a08-9eb5-48abee506a20">

   systems. By the end of the series, even Young was able to see past the callous and aloof front Rush presented to the world to see his inner courage and compassion for others.

   While it might be tempting to view Rush as a sociopath, the profile of a sociopath indicates an inability to love, which we know is not the case (he is shown very definitely to love his wife). He also has a drive to make decisions for the greater good (of humanity) rather than for individuals, but has more of the hallmarks of someone with an antisocial personality disorder than a sociopath.
