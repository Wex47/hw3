   Visually, a Zero Point Module resembles a large, translucent group of primarily orange-colored crystals approximately one foot in height with a roughly cylindrical shape. When activated, a ZPM emits a yellow glow from its center, with a small red circle at the top illuminating once the device has been fully engaged. This illumination ceases once the ZPM has been disconnected from whatever it was powering or has become fully depleted.

   The device itself serves as an enclosure for an artificially created pocket of subspace-time.
   Zero point energy
   is extracted from this pocket until it reaches maximum entropy, at which point the pocket collapses, leaving behind a useless shell. (

   Like many types of
   Ancient technology
   , Zero Point Modules are crystal-based. The crystals that compose the shell of the ZPM are similar in many ways to the
   crystals

   </a>
   and
   Tok'ra
   : red crystals contain the necessary programs to allow ZPMs to provide power to Ancient technology when a ZPM is interfaced with a conduit, while yellow crystals act as a buffer to prevent catastrophic overload. The crystals of a ZPM are virtually indestructible and can remain functional for hundreds of thousands of years. (

   The life of a ZPM is inversely proportional to the power demands placed on it. If not in use, a ZPM will maintain its power level indefinitely. However, even if exposed to constant strain, ZPMs will still supply power for thousands of years, depending on the degree of the strain; the power generated by three of them enabled
   Atlantis' shield
   to survive the pressure of several hundred feet of ocean for 10,000 years. A single ZPM, at nearly full power, could provide enough energy to resist constant bombardment by
   Wraith
   Hive ships
   for days before depleting. (

   The ZPM, at least the ones with some charge, made sounds that are like musical notes, but the sounds are so low that no human can hear them. Only those species with enhanced hearing, like the
   Koan
   can. (

   The fact that the Lanteans often searched for alternatives techniques that did not require ZPM energy, such as Atlantis's spike-like defenses against icebergs, suggest that the ZPM's fabrication process wasn't cheap or easy. (

   In addition to the ZPMs powering the Hive ship, Todd provided Atlantis with two additional ZPMs to power their Stardrive, having been convinced to by Sheppard as an act of spite against his treacherous underling who had stolen the Hive ship. Using the ZPMs, Atlantis was able to reach Earth through a combination of its hyperdrive and an experimental
   Wormhole drive
   . Ultimately, the city lacked the firepower to defeat the Hive, and in the attempt was forced into the atmosphere. Unable to regain orbit, the city landed near
   San Francisco
   ,
   cloaked

   and
   Richard Woolsey
   forcing the IOA's hand. With three ZPMs powering the hyperdrive, Atlantis would be able to make the journey between Earth and
   Lantea
   in just nine days. However, seven days into the journey, on the edge of the Pegasus Galaxy, one of the hyperdrive induction arrays malfunctioned from damage sustained in battle and began drawing massive amounts of power in order to widen the hyperspace corridor. Though dropping out of hyperspace fixed this, the damage was already done: the hyperdrive was damaged beyond the Tau'ri's ability to repair and the ZPMs were drained to twenty percent power. The crew managed to land Atlantis on a relatively close planet that was marginally habitable, but the process drained the ZPMs further down to nine percent. (

     After SG-1 accidentally altered the timeline so that Ra took the Giza Stargate with him when he left Earth, they left the ZPM with a canopic jar containing Daniel Jackson's video camera and a tablet that only Jackson could translate. However, the camera ran out of power before Daniel could explain the purpose of the ZPM, with the result that the new timeline never learned of it's potential use as a power source.
