   between itself and another Stargate, allowing near-instantaneous travel from the dialing gate to the destination gate, but not vice versa. When a given address is inputted, the dialing gate connects to the receiving gate over a subspace link and quickly exchanges precise locational details, then establishes a stable wormhole between them. When activated, a Stargate produces a violent burst of energy known as an

   or "kawoosh". This is due to the large amount of energy needed to form a stable wormhole, while keeping one open is much less power-intensive. This event will destroy any matter it comes into contact with; however, if the
   event horizon
   is blocked to within a few microns, the vortex will be suppressed. In order to warn people in the vacinity of the unstable vortex the Stargate emits an "alert" two loud medium/high pitched noises in order to warn people standing in the vacinity of the Stargate an incoming vortex is about to form. Technologies such as the

   's Stargate can achieve this. The vortex settles into the event horizon, nicknamed the puddle for its liquid appearance. Travelers enter through the event horizon, which dematerializes them for transport through the wormhole, to be reassembled on the other side. The Stargate will remain open so long as matter or energy continues to pass through it, to a maximum of 38 minutes. Beyond this point, massive amounts of power are needed to sustain a wormhole, which ordinary sources cannot provide.

   Travel through a Stargate is strictly one-way: from the dialing gate to the receiving gate. This is not a limitation of the wormhole, but of the technology; wormholes will transmit anything that enters them, but no solid matter could survive the process. Thus, each gate in the pair takes on a specific role: the dialing gate converts the traveler into its most basic components (sub-atomic particles) and transmits it, while the receiving gate reassembles the transmitted matter back into its original form. Doing the reverse is not only fatal for the traveler, but would just result in the dialing gate deconstructing the object upon arrival, converting it into energy much like the process of ascension.

It is unknown what would happen if someone entered the dialing Stargate via the 'back' (the opposite side of the gate from the one that generates the 'kawoosh') rather than the 'front' (the side generating the 'kawoosh');

Its design renders it incredibly durable; direct meteor impacts have failed to destroy a gate, and they have also survived within a crashing vessel unharmed. The naquadah construction of a Stargate allows it to hold many times the necessary amount of power for a wormhole to form, but it does have a limit. Surpassing this limit will create an explosion of considerable size, enough to potentially kill all life on a planet the size of Earth. (

These two features are used as a coordinate system for the gate to target and form a connection with another gate; each chevron is locked to a specific glyph, thereby allowing the gate to connect to another.

   The network formed by prototype Stargates functions differently than the full-fledged networks in the Milky Way and Pegasus galaxies. The Stargates are seeded in a relatively straight line, from one end of a galaxy to the other, leaving a course for

   to follow. Over extended periods, these will drift out of alignment due to stellar motions. Destiny is either close enough behind the seed ships that the line is still straight when it passes through a seeded galaxy or the Ancients compensated for stellar drift and sent the seed ships to planets that would eventually be along the corridor by the time Destiny passes through.

Though far away gates are normally out of range, any other gate in the chain within a single galaxy can be reached by leapfrogging through the gates in-between, though intergalactic dialing is not possible from a normal gate.

However, given that the gates spin, just like Milky Way gates, it is likely that this is possible, as the Ancients explicitly removed the ability of the gates to spin when they wanted to lock out this dialing method. While the unavailability of a remote means the gate is ostensibly unusable, the remotes are actually more helpful in that a traveler does not need to memorize a gate address and manually plot it in. Rather, they simply have to browse the list of available addresses on the remote, and press on the one they want to commence the dialing sequence. (

   Matter transmission is a three-step process: dematerialization, transmission, and reintegration. When an object passes through the
   event horizon
   , it is dematerialized and held in a "hyperspatial
   buffer
   ". The event horizon will only dematerialize objects in discrete units (one person, one ship, etc.), so any object which has not fully entered the event horizon can be removed without trouble. The gate does not begin transmitting an object until it has entirely passed through the event horizon. This ensures that only complete objects are transferred. In the case of larger objects such as

   Once an object is dematerialized, it is transmitted in the form of energy to the destination gate. Power is supplied by the dialing gate. If the power supply is interrupted the wormhole can disconnect prematurely, which may prevent the energy from being reassembled into the original object, or simply release the energy in its original form of matter (but in the form of atomic scale dust) into space well short of its destination. In cases where the power from the transmitting gate terminates and the receiving gate has a complete object in the buffer and a DHD, the DHD of the receiving gate will provide the power necessary to rematerialize the object prior to the gate shutting down. If there is any matter in the buffer on either side when the wormhole shuts down, it is stored until the next use, at which point the buffer is erased. (

   The event horizon is able to determine the difference between passive and active contact of nearby matter in order to prevent unwanted transmission. This process keeps things such as air and water, which naturally exert pressure on their surroundings, from passing through the gate while allowing people and anything deliberately sent through the gate to pass freely. In one case, water that mostly submerged a gate (but did not completely cover it) applied constant pressure to the event horizon and to Atlantis' Stargate shield, keeping the wormhole active for the maximum amount of time. In another instance, the gate is knocked over into a pool of lava, and the lava appears to briefly enter the event horizon before the gate shuts down. (

In a few cases, Stargates have been dialed "manually" when more sophisticated means were not available. This was accomplished by providing sufficient raw power to the gate and then rotating the symbol ring by hand to lock each chevron. Power can be fed directly into the

   that comprises the gate; power harnessed from
   lightning
   strikes has been shown to be sufficient for several seconds of transmission. Stargates also possess the means to harness the energy of nearby (in relative terms) quantum singularities, though it is unknown what methods it uses to accomplish this. The Stargate that establishes an outgoing wormhole determines how long the wormhole is held open, and can generally close the wormhole "at will". Under some conditions, a gate only needs enough power to connect briefly, then the receiving gate can provide enough power to maintain the connection. The same is true if the outgoing gate loses power while transmitting; if the incoming gate has a DHD, it will take over powering the gate until reintegration is complete. (

   Novus colony
   a single
   Berzerker drone
   hit the gate with a relatively weak energy weapon, but managed to blast a hole through the ring and disable the gate's ability to create a wormhole. This was the first time that a Stargate has been seen to be damaged by such a weapon, though the Berzerker drones' weapons may simply have properties that Stargates are vulnerable to. Another first-generation Stargate was able to survive a rockslide and later a

   All known Stargates have nine chevrons, on Milky Way and Pegasus gates each chevron lights up ('locks') as a symbol is entered. Hence an eight-symbol address can be referred to as an eight-chevron address. Partly because DHDs are only able to power seven-chevron (same-galaxy) connections, these are the most common and the eighth and ninth chevrons are never used by most societies, who attach mythical meanings to them. In many cases the eights and ninth chevrons are not even visible, hidden beneath the 'ground level' of a stargate platform.
  </p>
  <p key="9af98796-f50d-4b89-bb07-d58fbee0cc6a">
   In reality, eight-chevron addresses connect to other galaxies, with the extra symbol in the address acting as an area code. Nine-chevron addresses function entirely differently and enable connections with specific stargates regardless of their place in the universe; although the exact functioning is ambiguous as the only known example of this is the Ancient ship

   </i>
   . In this case, the address is a fixed nine-symbol code and the point of origin symbol is not required. Destiny itself also uses a nine-chevron address to dial back to Earth but, as the Earth gate is not the one originally used by the Ancients, this implies either that Destiny was able to identify the address of the new Earth gate and update its database, or that some nine-chevron addresses do identify a location instead of a specific stargate.

Even with this, the travel time between galaxies is just slightly over thirty minutes, making it far more efficient than traveling by

   The satellite also had the added effect of preventing Stargate travel through the Atlantis Stargate as long as the satellite maintained its connection to the dialing Stargate, as both gates would be attempting to use the Atlantis coordinates. The satellite was able to receive the incoming wormhole from the Asurans, indicating that it could override the Atlantis Stargate, the dominant Stargate on the planet due to its being connected to a DHD. It appeared as a satellite with a Stargate in the center of its form which allowed it to manoeuvre and, thus, direct the energy weapon. (

    The "Stargate" concept appears to be quite old in speculative fiction, likely evolved from ideas of magic "portals" in fantasy literature and the folk tales it sprang from. One of the most notable renditions of it can be found in the
    series of novels by
    (Book 1,
    , published 1989). There, the
    Hegemony of Man
    consists of hundreds of planets, the more important of which are linked by portals, called
    , allowing instantaneous (bi-directional) travel. Many Farcaster portals (millions) can exist on a single planet, any of which may connect to any other planet (for example, there is a river,

    , which flows through Farcasters across all the connected planets and loops upon itself). Farcaster portals are always open, and function basically as short-range terminals to a "singularity sphere" placed in orbit of the connected world, which performs the actual interstellar transportation.

This particular game is full of pop-culture references, it could as well be an intended parody of and/or homage/tribute to Stargate, rather than coincidental similarity (the device is circular, has glyphs on it and is spinning while "dialing" in a similar manner to Stargate. However, it doesn't lead to another planet, rather to a different dimension referred to as "world of malice" and is much bigger than a Stargate - but not as big as supergate).

If a Stargate is shut down, occupants in transit will be trapped in the alternate Hyperspace dimension that the device operates on. They will still be partially visible from the perspective of real-space, but they will simply pass through any real-space objects that they encounter and will not be able to exit Hyperspace or interact with real-space.
