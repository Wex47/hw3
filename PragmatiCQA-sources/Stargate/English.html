   After the Anglo-Saxons invaded the territory, that is now modern day England in the late 5th century, they founded several Kingdoms of their own and the original Celtic languages where slowly replaced with their Language (Old Saxon/ Old English) as these Germanic settlers soon became a majority in the southern part of Britain. 
Viking raids, language contact with Scandinavian settlers and Christianization contributed towards influences of Old Norse and Latin in Old English, whereas the Norman Conquest in the 11th century was mainly responsible for the transition to Middle English and the abundance of gallicisms found in Modern English. 
The colonial campaigns of the British Empire and the post World War II influence of US-American media, economy, science and politics helped to establish Late Modern English as a lingua franca in many aspects of human life throughout planet Earth.
