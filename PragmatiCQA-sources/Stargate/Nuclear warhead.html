     with the intention of detonating a nuclear warhead. Although
     Ra
     was killed during the
     Abydos Mission
     , it is unclear if the warhead was detonated aboard his mothership as occurred in our reality. Two years later, O'Neill wiped out the population of
     Chulak
     with a nuclear warhead in the hope of halting the attack on
     Earth
     .
     Teal'c
     's wife
     Drey'auc
     and son
     Rya'c
     were among the casualties. Teal'c later personally lead the invasion of the
     SGA
     and eventually killed Jack in revenge for the deaths of his family.
