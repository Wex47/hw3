   After having swapped bodies with Telford, Dr. Rush saw flashes of Telford's memory in a dream, revealing him as a Lucian Alliance spy. As something similar had occurred before, between Telford and Scott, it was found to be due to the effects of a Goa'uld brainwashing technique. Rush swapped bodies with Telford again and attempted to infiltrate the Alliance in his body. Rush was captured by

Kiva initially moved to kill him, thinking he was Rush, but Telford convinced her of his identity using his code-word identification and pretended to still be brainwashed. Telford eventually hatched a plan to separate Kiva from the hostages so the military could retake the ship, but was caught in the act by Kiva. Telford quickly shot Kiva and fatally wounded her but not before she could also return a shot, injuring but not killing Telford. As a result of Kiva's death, Telford's betrayal was never revealed to the Lucian Alliance, although
   Simeon
   seemed suspicious of his story of he and Kiva being ambushed. Later Telford, in intense pain from his wound, tried to convince a now insane
   Dannic
   to surrender, but he was beyond reason and went to kill Telford after Telford accused him of wanting

When Wray and Greer couldn't get out and Telford told them the bomb sqaud couldn't get in, they volunteered to disarm the bomb themselves.
