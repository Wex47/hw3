Due to Ba'al fleeing when Rebel Jaffa boarded his ship, Jaffa completely lost their image of the Goa'uld as gods and began to abandon them by the hundreds, severely weakening whatever was left of the System Lords. Anubis intended to claim the weapon on Dakara for himself, and to use it to destroy all life in the galaxy in order to repopulate the galaxy to his own specifications. However the intervention of
   Oma Desala
   spared the galaxy as she engaged Anubis in eternal battle on another plane of existence. (

       Zeus
      </b>
      was the 'son' of
      Cronus
      (one of the most influential System Lords), and 'brother' to
      Hera
      ,
      Poseidon
      , and
      Hades
      . He preferred to fight, dine, and celebrate with his Jaffa warriors. He was first encountered by an SG team on the planet Olympus, and was found to be so amiable that the SG team did not consider him to be a threat. Zeus used this false impression to his advantage and briefly had the SG team fight a rival "evil" Goa'uld for him. After Cronus' death, Zeus claimed much of his territory.
