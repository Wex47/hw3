    black hole
   </b>
   is a concentrated singularity of gravity caused by a dead
   star
   collapsing in on itself, which absorbs everything within its reach, including light. Black holes cannot be seen, but the accretion disk, which is the flow of matter being pulled by the black hole, is visible. As one gets closer to a black hole, time appears to slow down, but since time is
   relative
   , it is only slow compared to those who are viewing it at a "normal" rate. (
