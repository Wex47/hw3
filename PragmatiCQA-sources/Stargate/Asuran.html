   . Turning to
   nanite
   technology, the Lanteans built nanites which would allow for organic assimilation and self replication, encoded with an aggression code that surpassed even that of the Wraith. Without warning, the nanites suddenly began replicating and interlocking, taking the most advanced form they knew—human. Even in this form, the aggression codes remained. Fueled by a rage they could not understand, the machines begged the Lanteans to remove the aggression programming, but the Lanteans refused, for they had created base codes that prevented the Asurans from harming them, and they were desperate to find a weapon to destroy the Wraith.

   , the Asurans, having regained most of their former strength, reemerged in the Pegasus Galaxy and launched their own offensive against the Wraith. In their arrogance, the Wraith believed that they could once again utilize their superior numbers to achieve victory as they had against the Lanteans and attempted to do so but as the conflict ground on, grim realism began to set in as the Wraith command realized the Asuran offensive became practically unstoppable; not only did they possess a technological advantage, the Asurans were also immune to Wraith feeding due to the fact that they were robots, were physically superior beings and most importantly, they could more than match the quantity of Wraith production of warships and troops. At the climax of the conflict, Wraith Hive Ships were, in mere weeks at a time, falling by the hundreds and Cruisers by the thousands while the Asurans were completely unfazed by the loss of any amount of their ships, able to simply replace them in a very short time.

   The Wraith, after suffering this seemingly-endless series of shattering defeats, finally concluded that they could not hope to militarily compete with the Asurans and subsequently created a shut down code that deactivated the Replicators' directive to attack them. This resulted in them returning to their homeworld where they isolated themselves to that planet alone. (

   One insidious ability of the nanites was their capacity to infect other races by a simple touch. A single brief moment of contact can allow an Asuran to infect a person with the nanites which begin replicating immediately inside the body. As they begin multiplying exponentially, they start to slowly consume the body of the host. The host body remains in a coma-state while this occurs and while the nanites were quite capable of killing it, in their diminished numbers they would not be able to survive on their own. This was why they began stripping the body of raw material to produce more of their number thus transforming the host into a new Asuran.

   This was only done so until they reached sufficient numbers to begin their own independent entity. This was one method through which they were capable of creating more Asurans but was not considered the standard practice and was more like a last desperate attempt to survive by the infecting Asuran. In this state, the nanites were vulnerable to electromagnetic pulses though they were capable of consuming the organic tissue of a body and integrate it into their form thus making them immune. As part of their programming, the nanites immediately find and destroy any form of Wraith

   The nanites contain an element of the infecting Asuran's personality which attempts to subvert the mind of the Human
   host
   through trickery. The power of the Replicator personality was determined by how many nanites were within the host body and the mind worked to suppress the immune system of the host in order to give the nanites the freedom to reproduce their numbers. This was why the host was in a coma state and was completely unaware of the process. (

   The Asuran nanites were highly aggressive due to the nature of their programming as they were to be used as a bioweapon. This was so great that it surpassed their enemies even. The technology used allowed for the organic assimilation and self-replication to increase their effectiveness. This increased to the point that the molecular machines began to form even more complex organisms and eventually evolved into the most efficient form they knew of which was that of their creators. The nanites were able to incorporate organic material into their makeup if the raw material was available. (

Another directive prevented them from altering their physical appearance to match another living being. The basic core of their being was programmed in a way that made them feel a need to attack the Wraith. While this was the case, it was possible for outsiders to alter the Base code. Initial tampering allowed for the Asurans to alter their own programming, allowing them to bypass the directive that prevented them from harming their own creators. (

   The Asurans were each individual units despite their basic command code being interconnected over a powerful subspace frequency. While this was the case, they were not a collective hive mind like the

   . This expansive subspace network linked them all together and allowed them to know whatever their comrades were perceiving. This also allowed them to watch for signs of betrayal among their kind and were capable of resetting a rogue Asuran who has reverted to their base programming which is a highly aggressive state that attacks any enemies that it perceives. While rogue Asurans were capable of being reprogrammed by the collective, certain groups were capable of maintaining their presence and hiding within it. The subspace collective allowed the Asurans to track their own movements. (

   A key advantage provided by the subspace link was the capacity to adapt to certain threats. This was namely the case against the threat posed by
   Anti-Replicator guns
   . While ordinarily the weapon was able to break the bonds between the nanites, continuous exposure to the energy allows the Asurans to collectively work out it's frequency and develop an immunity. Furthermore, it allowed them to restore a deceased member of their kind allowing for a destroyed Asuran to be recreated. Each of the Asurans exist within the collective and can be replicated many times. This was done through the subspace collective which was responsible for digitizing the Asuran mind and aiding in its placement within a new body. (

   <b key="de9a6e2c-c529-44b3-8ca4-fd4a1b78e12a">
    Merges
   </b>
   . This allowed the Asurans to exchange new information among themselves and disseminate new data among their people. Any hacking into their network can be detected once a Merge occurs which causes all the Asurans to freeze until all the new data has been distributed among their kind. While they were capable of doing this normally, the Asurans also possessed a
   Central data core
   which acts as a backup hard drive for the collective and aids in spreading the data of a Merge. (

   While a potent advantage, the subspace link and their programming has shown a number of weaknesses. Outsiders were capable of altering the base code and were capable of causing a momentary freeze that affected all the Asurans. The Wraith demonstrated the capacity of infecting the Asuran's with a virus that deactivated their directive that forced them to attack their mortal enemies. Attempts to manipulate the link can be established by a small number of nanites or by captured lone Asurans. However, despite this being the case, the Asurans demonstrated the ability to harden their defenses to prevent such attacks in the future. (
