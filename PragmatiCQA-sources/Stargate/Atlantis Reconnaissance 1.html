   Sheppard later led a rescue team and saved Teyla and Bates as well as the captured Athosians but during the battle he was forced to kill Sumner as he had begun aging rapidly due to the

   Hoffans
   began mass-inoculation straightaway but it was later discovered that the drug itself had a side-effect: 50% of those who took it died while the other 50 survived. The Hoffans, realizing the success of the drug voted in favor of it and even asked AR-1 to help them bring the drug to other worlds but Sheppard told them that the Wraith would wipe them as a result and disgusted by the society's willingness to easily sacrifice its people withdrew his support and he and his team returned to Atlantis. AR-1 later came across a race known as the
   Genii
   who were not farmers but in fact a military society and would later become their greatest enemy. The Genii leader,
   Commander
   Cowen
   told a captive Sheppard and McKay that his people had been building
   A-bombs
   for years in hopes that they could be one day used to destroy the Wraith but any chance of a possible relationship between the two races was permanently soured when the Genii held Teyla personally responsible for leaving

Koyla invaded the city and took both Weir and McKay, forcing Sheppard into a game of cat and mouse as he attempted to rescue his two friends while preventing Atlantis's destruction. Sixty Genii soldiers were killed when Sheppard triggered the

However, they both lost in the end when the newly formed Brotherhood informed AR-1 that they were going to put the ZPM into hiding and wait for the Ancients to return so that they could be greatly rewarded, not realizing that the Ancients themselves were long gone. When AR-1 got back to Atlantis, they were informed that three Hive ships were on their way to attack Atlantis and would reach the city in less than two weeks. (
