My only regret is that his death was quick." Teyla understood his motivation but warned him the others would not approve and they agreed to keep it between the two of them. (

   , allowing Teyla's ship to destroy it. The team is captured trying to reach Teyla and she visits them to tell them not to escape and that everything will be alright. However, this is witnessed by the Commander who attacks and nearly kills her before Todd stuns and kills him. With the Commander dead, Teyla solidifies her position as leader of the alliance and leaves the ship with the excuse that she is returning to Todd's ship as it was her original ship, but warns Todd that if he betrays his word, she will make a reappearance to remove him permanently. The rest of the team is transferred to Todd's ship and they return to

   , Teyla resumed her role as Steelflower, Todd's Queen to help him gain support against Queen Death. Due to training from Todd while she had previously posed as his Queen, Teyla's mental powers were far more developed and she was now capable of killing Wraith with her mind and making others submit to her will as well as flying Wraith ships with ease. With Teyla's help, Todd was able to gain a small fleet to stand against Queen Death while Teyla gained genetic memories of the First Mother

During this time, she and Sheppard finally admitted their feelings for each other, though they kept their relationship on the down-low, as USAF regulations prohibited any relationship between a team leader and those under his command.

   Coldamber
   in a similar situation, Teyla was now more experienced and less frightened of her powers than before. While Death's mind was powerful, she was undisciplined and inexperienced and Teyla defeated her. When Queen Death refused to surrender to her, Teyla telepathically killed her though she gave credit to Waterlight. Following the end of Queen Death,
   Ashes
   , the Wraith who had been manipulating Queen Death was brought before Teyla, Waterlight and
   Alabaster

     Wraith sensing

    : The most common ability amongst the Wraithkin is the ability to sense the presence of the Wraith when in proximity. While some are able to do it stronger than others, Teyla has always been amongst the strongest. This part of Teyla abilities appeared to expand over time with Teyla able to sense that
    Ellia
    was different than the other Wraith and that another

    and was very close to the one she was currently on. She was also able to sense that at least one
    Wraith cruiser
    had entered orbit over
    Levanna
    . Teyla's ability to sense Wraith extends for miles and she can sense if a Wraith is further away or has moved much closer. However, if the Wraith are in hibernation, she is unable to sense them, even in close proximity to a hive ship with a hibernating crew. Following Guide's training, Teyla was sure that she would be able to sense a hive ship even if it was hiding on the other side of a planet. (

Teyla has also been able to use this to pass on a message to the Wraith in order to trick them. (

While Wraith can take control of Teyla if she links with them, they generally need Teyla to link with them first. Despite this,
    one
    was able to initiate a link Teyla and take control of her. However, this appeared to be more of a hypnotic command than a full possession. The same Wraith was later able to initiate a link to communicate with Teyla over 10,000 light years, farther than normal Wraith telepathic communication, but the Wraith's abilities were enhanced by his state as a
    Human-Wraith Hybrid
    at the time. On another occasion, after Teyla linked with her,
    an extremely powerful Wraith Queen
    demonstrated the ability to take control of Teyla's mind and body, successfully posing as Teyla to her friends. However, Teyla needed to open her mind first and when fully prepared, was able to even plant a false memory for the Queen to find as a trick. (

    in using her abilities, Teyla was able to effortlessly use this ability to fly Wraith ships on her own. However, this control can remain somewhat limited at times due to unfamiliarity with the specific systems Teyla is trying to control. (

    : Throughout their time together on the team they have always had a strong friendship. But once Atlantis was stuck on Earth. John lied to an IOA member who was shamelessly flirting with Teyla that she was his wife to make him stop. After John started watching Torren carrying him around and babysitting. John and Teyla both could feel their attraction growing. But after being friends for so long did not know how to handle it or what to say, which led to very awkward silences between the two. After McKay was captured, They finally acknowledged the unspoken feelings between themselves while on a mission to recover the Lantean scout ship Avenger for the genii. Their banto stick fighting sessions became much more intimate for both. They eventually consummated their new feelings in Teyla's secret lair after they could no longer deny them any longer. The relationship was not without its hurtles to get over. With Teyla having doubts because of what her clan would think and of her having wraith DNA and not entirely sure that John would accept this part of her fully and John having to decide if its right dating a team member and who is under his command. But, John accepted her heritage making her understand that it didn't bother him in the slightest. Even proclaiming she is not Todd's Queen, but his, removing any doubts within Teyla. This was after Teyla hinted if Guide could make Teyla a Wraith full-time, as was done with Rodney, he would. Ronon felt their relationship was making John more sympathetic to the Wraith and didn't approve at first. Though this was mostly due to his own issues with the wraith. Many members of the Atlantis expedition have thought for years these two would get together. With many not surprised when it was finally confirmed. Wraith would even refer to John as Steelflower's consort, for they could sense the relationship between the two. They spend most of their downtime with each other and Teyla's son who has come to call Shepard "Da" due to how close John is with him and Teyla.   (

While Teyla was his prisoner, Michael doesn't harm her and when she inquires of her fate once her baby is born, Michael is hesitant to tell her, indicating he still does care about her somewhat from their brief time as friends. When she calls him insane, Michael is actually hurt by it indicating her opinion of him actually matters to him. (

She refuses and escapes with Ronon's help. She considers his offer when he promises to spare her friends, but after exposing that promise as false, refuses. Teyla joins the final fight against him at the top of Atlantis' Control Tower and knocks him off the balcony. Michael is left at her mercy, but instead of saving him, she kicks his hands off the ledge, sending him falling hundreds if not thousands of feet, finally killing him. (
