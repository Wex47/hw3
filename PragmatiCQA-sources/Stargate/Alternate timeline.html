   and thus slowing SG-1 down, they were able to ensure SG-1 never fell into Hecate's trap. However, this simply created an alternate timeline which O'Neill and Carter realized when they were not erased from existence. In the process, they discovered that Hecate had been responsible for everything that had happened. Returning to the future of their own timeline, O'Neill and Carter led an effort to liberate the Earth from the Goa'uld and the Wraith.

   SGC

Finally, after a couple of months, the virus went active, causing instant sterility in those afflicted by it of both sexes and terminating all active pregnancies. By the time the virus went active, it was global and affected people worldwide. However, Mirris was sloppy in creating the virus and it mutated and jumped species to infect plants and animals as well, all except a few species of bird that were naturally immune and cockroaches. The effects of the virus caused chaos on Earth with governments collapsing, people turning against each other and eventually those that could escape off-planet fleeing to places such as

   Ite-kh

However, while the Tau'ri were able to win a few victories, the virus, which eventually burnt out, had already done too much damage to the Tau'ri who faced extinction within a generation with all of the other planets affected by the virus facing the same fate by the year 2032.

   In the aftermath, the Pack were forced to find a planet to settle on for the first time in a millennia due to the damage they took. The virus was traced to a plant that was gifted to Earth as part of the proceedings and destroyed before it could unleash the virus, something that it was designed to do only when exposed to Earth's unique biosphere, effectively changing the future. Despite this, Commander O'Neill and his daughter decided to return to the future despite the chance that they might be erased from existence as a result and set it up so that the Stargate on the planet with Janus' lab would be permanently disabled, preventing anyone from ever finding Janus' time travel devices.

   In the meantime, Mitchell and Vala are left stuck in 1908 with no way home and start posing as a married couple, moving in with Lovecraft's family. After learning that someone died in the fire that shouldn't have, their worries about changing the future for the worse spur them to search for the device that General Carter and Cassandra had used to return to 1908 and set things right, becoming rich in the process using Mitchell's knowledge of future events to make good investments. They ultimately manage to find one half of the device amongst Lovecraft's things and the other half in King Tut's tomb and dig up the Stargate with orders to rebury it. Their orders are ignored and the Stargate is later displayed in the Metropolitan Museum in New York while their influence changes Lovecraft from a writer to a scientist.

   Though Mitchell promises to help get the hand device for the team, they choose to aid the Earth of the alternate timeline in stopping the invasion. With the help of An, the team is able to steal two Little Boy-type atomic bombs and rig them. By beaming them aboard Ra and Qetesh's ships, they are able to destroy the ships and kill Ra and Qestesh, Vala along with them. Mitchell escapes through a
   ring transporter
   to New York where he takes command of the surviving Goa'uld forces and orders them to retreat. Mitchell is able to provide the team with the hand device to use the Stargate to return to 1908 and set things right, but chooses to remain in the alternate 1947 since he belongs in the alternate timeline. An remains with Mitchell and suggests that the alternate timeline will continue to exist as a separate reality from the one the team knows rather than being erased completely. An intends to be rescued when the Asgard check out what happened to him and joins Mitchell in going to the world leaders in the aftermath of the invasion.

Meanwhile, Greer is unfortunately attacked and killed by the creatures. Young and Scott start firing on the creatures as Spencer attempts to save Greer by taking the creature off. However, the creature kills him as well. Young and Scott still fight, however Young is also killed. Scott is very unhappy to find out that he's the only survivor of the attack. He records a message on a Kino, detailing the illness and what needs to be done before sending it back in time via the wormhole and solar flare. Again everyone on the
