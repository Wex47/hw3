   Wraith

   tattoo
   centered around his left eye. He was named by

   Before his capture, Todd was a Wraith of some political standing; after being freed he is in loose command of about a dozen
   Hive ships
   (out of at least sixty in the galaxy), and these had remained loyal to him during his imprisonment, implying that he used to command even more, most probably because he is at least 10,000 years old. He notes that his time spent in
   Commander
   Acastus Kolya
   's prison diminished his standing among the Wraith, further supporting the notion that he held a great deal of influence before. He is also an adept scientist, having a significant understanding of
   nanite
   coding as well as
   Wraith technology

   Todd was born in the closing stages of the
   Lantean-Wraith war
   , and took part in the
   final assault
   on
   Atlantis
   some 10,000 years before present time. Early in his life he received his Wraith name "Guide" for the quality his mind had in Wraith telepathic communication - the feel of "one who goes alone, ahead. One who is sure-footed and certain, capable of finding a way for others who follow behind."

   Queen
   Snow
   , whose hive Guide joined with his friend
   Ember
   when Snow's influence in wider Wraith society was marginal and her hive in poor repair. With Snow's hive Guide participated in an covert operation to disable the

Guide and his party succeeded in re-writing the Asuran command codes and escaping the city and the Asuran system. After the success of this mission, which saved the entire Wraith species from probable extinction at the hands of the relentless Asurans, Guide rose to the position of Consort, the highest position a male Wraith can hold.

He told them that although he saw the benefits of the endeavor (particularly since the recent plague meant that the Wraith were taking a risk any time they fed in case they came across a plague survivor who would kill the Wraith if they were fed on), in order to disseminate the therapy with the other hives in the alliance they would need to convince the leader, the
   Primary
   queen. There was a slight problem to the plan—the Primary would only meet with another
   queen
   , and Todd's queen was killed a year ago when his
   Hive Ship
   was destroyed. However, the Primary did not know this. He then proposed a plan in which
   Teyla Emmagan
   , being a
   Wraithkin
   , could pose as a queen for the dealings. She agreed and the two set off to meet with the Primary's hive ship and the queen. As soon as they were on board, the ship jumped into
   hyperspace
   , surprising Todd and Teyla. The Primary met them soon after, but Todd killed her almost immediately and told Teyla to take the blame. After a brief confrontation with the hive's
   commander
   , Teyla was made the new queen. She then ordered the ship to drop out of hyperspace.

   cancer-like disease
   . The disease spread to his Hive Ship when in symbiosis with the crew during stasis. His
   warriors
   turned feral and tried to eat several humans, while the hive's systems behaved erratically. Todd told the team that being fed on by an
   Iratus bug
   queen could reverse the effects of the disease and that there was a planet three days' journey away inhabited by the insects.

   John Sheppard
   rejected the suggestion because the ship was too damaged to make a
   hyperspace
   journey. After a short altercation between the two, Todd was imprisoned in a holding cell on the hive. Soon though, the ship could no longer handle the strain and broke in half, with the team in the forward section, which began to fall towards M35-117's surface. While McKay felt they could use the maneuvering thrusters to slow the ship's descent, he didn't have enough knowledge of Wraith systems to perform the necessary bypass. To fix this problem, Sheppard approached Todd who welcomed the possibility of death rather than suffer to death from the disease. Sheppard offered a deal: if Todd landed the ship, Sheppard would take him to the planet he sought to get his cure. With the help of McKay, Todd was successfully able to power the maneuvering thrusters and glided the ship to a crash-landing on the ocean. Atlantis rescued everyone before the ship sank and Sheppard proposed to Woolsey that they keep their deal with Todd, seeing him as their best chance of ever beating the Wraith. Woolsey reluctantly agreed and Sheppard allowed Todd to leave through the Stargate to seek his cure. Before leaving, Todd promised to remember Sheppard's actions. (

In order to help combat the super-hive, Sheppard decides to take Atlantis itself to Earth and approaches Guide for the location of more ZPMs to power the city. Sheppard is able to get Guide to give them the ZPMs by reminding him that his underling had betrayed him and he should help them if only to spite the underling. Guide is left amused by the fact that Sheppard knows how to convince him to do what he wants. Later, after the super-hive is destroyed in
   battle
   , Guide reminds Sheppard that Earth is safe due to his warning and ZPMs and asks what Sheppard will do with him. Sheppard remains silent to Guide's question. (

   Following the destruction of the

   . Refusing to have anything to with experimentation on Guide, Beckett brought forth the idea of instead placing Guide in
   stasis
   to Sheppard which would keep Guide alive and from being a security threat. Sheppard brought the idea to Guide who planned to ask Sheppard to kill him before the starvation got too great, knowing Sheppard would likely do it after seeing what starvation had done to him in Koyla's prison. While surprised by Sheppard's solution, Guide agreed and asked for his regular clothes back. After Beckett and McKay check his clothes, they return them to him, removing a
   Wraith tracker
   and the components to make two more from the clothes. With the help of Keller, Beckett was able to calibrate the stasis chamber for Wraith physiology and safely place Guide within.

   After finding
   Manaria
   destroyed by the Wraith with booby traps all over the place, Sheppard has Guide revived so he can help them get past the booby traps. Guide is greatly disturbed to see Manaria destroyed with much of its population not even fed upon, seeing it as wasteful and disturbing. Guide is able to help the team clear a path to the Customs House where McKay disarms another booby trap on the computer systems and they discover a message from
   Queen

   . Guide is further disturbed, especially when he learns Queen Death's name. Guide explains that while the queen in the message is young and he doesn't know her personally, Queen Death is a Wraith fairy tale and for this queen to have taken on the name, she must be a remarkable woman. Guide tells Sheppard that there are a hundred stories about Queen Death and they all start with "once before we slept, there was a queen called Death and she was glorious in her name." Guide tells Sheppard while he doesn't know more about the queen who has taken on that name, she is a legend reborn and is shown to be shaken by the implications. As the team leaves the Customs House with Guide, the Stargate activates and two
   Wraith Darts
   arrive, causing Guide to suddenly try to make a break for it before being shot by Sergeant Baker. Sheppard is able to recapture Guide who he realizes to his frustration managed to signal his people to come get him. Guide attempts to convince Sheppard to let him go, telling Sheppard that he has no desire to join Queen Death and if released, he will retake control of his alliance and stand in counterpoise to Queen Death for Atlantis. Knowing that Guide wants to control the Wraith for himself, Sheppard decides to take the chance and reluctantly releases him. Guide is picked up by one of the Darts and returns to his hive ship. McKay and Beckett later determine that while they removed all the Wraith transmitters and components that they could find, Guide had more in a dormant or seedling stage and grew a new one while in stasis. When he traveled through the Stargate, the transmitter was activated and signaled his hive ship.

   Bonewhite
   and learns that after his disappearance, his alliance shattered and ultimately fell to Queen Death, leaving him in command of only his own hive ship. While Bonewhite insists that they join Queen Death, Guide refuses and decides to hold off on joining Queen Death for the time being. Later, Guide is taken to see damage to the ship that is only slowly healing and gets a status report from
   Ember

On Queen Death's hive ship, Guide is surprised to find how traditional everything is and is taken before Queen Death who has such a powerful presence she pulls Ease under her sway quickly and even the other members of Guide's crew start to falter. While Guide himself is affected by Queen Death's beauty, he is able to use his loyalty to and love for
   Snow
   to protect him. Queen Death confirms that Guide can make decisions for Queen Steelflower and then tells him that in order for the Wraith to survive, they must find the new feeding ground of

   and
   its galaxy
   but it will take all of the Wraith working together. To this end, Queen Death refuses to abide by anyone outside of her control and demands Guide's loyalty. Guide gives it, but continues to be disturbed by Queen Death's use of traditions that have long been out of style such as feeding on Ember briefly and making Guide and his men publicly feed. Queen Death tells Guide that she believes that the Wraith need to return to their old traditions to survive and has her
   Old One
   to guide her in this and suggests Guide can help as well.

   Shortly afterwards, Atlantis receives a message from Guide asking to meet on the planet
   Vell
   as he has learned the location of Queen Death's next big Culling and is willing to share it in exchange for some reasonable considerations. Though reluctant to trust Guide, the expedition realizes that they have no choice but to meet with him in case he offers something of real value. Sheppard's team takes a

   Wraith cruiser
   in orbit with a
   single shuttle
   with four Wraith landed on the ground. Sheppard contacts Guide by radio and tells him that he will land two kilometers north of his position and they will meet in the middle which Guide agrees to. Accompanied by two Wraith warriors and another Wraith commander, Guide meets with Sheppard and his team. Sheppard tells Guide that given the way things went the last few times they worked with him, they are unsure about trusting his information though he agrees that the location of Queen Death's next Culling would be worth a high price. Guide tells Sheppard that his price is anything they've discovered on the
   Hoffan plague
   , seeing it as being to both their benefits due to the effects of the plague on both humans and Wraith. Sheppard counters by asking Guide for the name of the planet, promising that if it checks out, they will leave the information Guide wants on Vell, unencrypted for Guide to pick up at his leisure. Though Guide is reluctant since Sheppard is asking him to take a great deal on trust, he understands Sheppard's caution and reveals that the planet is
   Levanna
   . Guide tells them that Queen Death will attack within three days and maybe a day or two longer, but no sooner. Guide tells Sheppard that if any of them survive he expects them to uphold their bargain and Sheppard promises to do so if Guide's information pans out. Sheppard and his team then depart followed soon after by Guide and his men. (

Sitting down inside of one of the huts, Keller explains that they want to know where McKay is and are willing to make a deal with Guide for any information that will help them find him. Guide admits that McKay's kidnapping is not of his doing and that he had his alliance render
   New Athos

   Athosians
   had been culled and his not wanting to fight with the expedition over what he felt was their territory. Keller explains how
   the raid

In an attempt to get Guide to agree to help them, Keller tries to find something that he would be interested in to no avail before they get word that more Wraith have arrived through the Stargate.

Keller reminds Guide of the dangerous amount of information McKay holds that he could give up to Queen Death including all of his knowledge on Wraith computer systems, the retrovirus that destroyed Guide's hive and how to reprogram nanites. While Guide is aware of the threat posed by McKay's capture, he is reluctant to help them as giving up Queen Death's position would endanger himself as Queen Death doesn't trust him and he could be found out. Keller suggests instead that Guide blame it on the Genii spy network and asks that he only give them the location of Queen Death's hive ship so that they can get McKay back. While Guide warns them that it will take some time for him to gather the necessary information, he agrees to do it and helps Keller and Ronon get back to the Stargate safely.

Guide sends Atlantis the location of

   Queen Death's hive ship will be at to digest new raw materials for hull repair and growth and informs them that during the time the ship is doing this, four to five hours, it is extremely vulnerable as it will be in a dormant state and will thus be defenseless.

  <p key="c831705a-371e-4fcb-84ea-1372dca1cc5e">
   Todd's personality is unusual for a natural pure-blooded
   Wraith
   . He is reasonable, surprisingly loyal, and to a degree quite honorable, usually keeping his bargains. He is far more willing to make compromises and deals with humans, and acts far less arrogantly in their presence, serving in many ways as the Wraith version of the

   's forces to achieve mutual goals. He regards the
   Atlantis expedition
   with neutrality, knowing that they are more useful as occasional allies than enemies. He also seems to care about the collective good of the Wraith, recognizing the benefits of developing a means of freeing the Wraith of their need to feed on humans after the wide-range dispersal of the
   Wraith-inoculation plague
   making it risky for the Wraith to feed at random as they had done before.

   During his imprisonment with

   John Sheppard
   , he commented that it would be worth escaping just to see the stars again, implying that he has a sense of beauty and appreciation of freedom. He also seems to regard the act of feeding as more of a necessity than an act of sadistic pleasure. He attempts to justify the Wraith's actions when it comes to feeding by comparing Wraith hunger to the pain of being burned alive. Notably, when he threatens to feed on the

   crewmembers when
   Ronon Dex
   begins sabotaging the ship, Ronon assumes he's bluffing, while this claim made by any other Wraith would be taken seriously, demonstrating that even he has a degree of respect for Todd despite his usual anti-Wraith stance. (

   More recently, due to his continued presence among the
   Atlantis teams
   , he seems to have developed a grudging respect for the teams' various abilities. During
   Teyla Emmagan
   's
   telepathic
   struggle with a
   Queen
   , he is seen looking on with a degree of surprised admiration. He is also shown to have something of a grudging respect for
   Rodney McKay
   and regrets his apparent death when McKay sacrifices himself to destroy

   . Presumably this is because of McKay's intelligence and abilities as a scientist which makes Todd more willing to work with him. It is unknown how much of his personality is due to his long imprisonment and contact with

  <p key="20ab286b-66f8-4192-a09d-6278a6c48f8f">
   Todd also has a unique relationship with John Sheppard. The two were forced to trust each other to get away from
   Acastus Kolya
   and afterwards both spared each other's lives, with Todd even restoring all of the life he took from Sheppard with the
   Gift of Life
   , something he refers to being reserved for the Wraiths most devout worshippers and their brothers. The two agree that "all bets are off" after that, but both agree that its best that they not meet again as neither really seem to want to kill the other, although Sheppard does repeatedly threaten to kill Todd over time. As a result of this, when the situation calls for it, Todd shows a willingness to work with Sheppard, despite a lack of trust between the two on at least Sheppard's side after the first experience. While Sheppard is mostly unwilling to believe Todd, noting that some of their collaborations have resulted in Todd withholding information or possibly using them to get what he wants- such as Todd establishing his authority over other Wraith hives while
   <i key="507831b1-f6f7-4894-8e29-8da9e999d3b3">
    claiming
   </i>
   that this will allow him to convince them to accept Atlantis's 'treatment' to remove their need to feed-, Todd trusts John to keep their deals at the very least. When Todd was willing to die when his hive ship was falling apart over
   M35-117
   , Sheppard gave him his word that he'd take him where he wanted to go and Todd took him at his word without question even though he was angry his crew was dead. Todd and Sheppard also seem to know what to say to each other to get them to do what they want of the other, with Todd even telling Sheppard "you know how to talk to me" when Sheppard convinces him to give up two

   </a>
   for Atlantis. Todd later counts on Sheppard to kill him if the hunger gets too great and purposefully doesn't feed on a man who looks like Sheppard, thinking to himself that the other Wraith must never learn that he wouldn't kill John Sheppard just to save himself. On Sheppard's end, he is shown to know what Todd wants him to do and puts him in stasis instead, wanting there to be a "next time" between the two of them. Todd also shows an extraordinary level of trust in Sheppard by allowing Sheppard to put him in stasis and trusting Sheppard to let him out again.

  <p key="d30bac32-bdd0-485a-9d11-cb78b3c7faeb">
   However, he is still very cunning and manipulative and does not hesitate to mislead or deceive the Atlantis expedition when he is working with them to serve his own ends. Most notably, he hacked into the Atlantis computer to find the
   Midway space station
   's location (later resulting in its destruction), however this act seems to have been to obtain information to act as insurance if the
   Atlantis Expedition
   were to betray him judging by his reaction when accused of being behind the Midway attack. On another occasion he kept his real plan secret when seeking Teyla's help in dealing with the
   Primary
   .
  </p>
  <p key="71f632df-e76f-47ab-b48c-f2d3f1dc03a5">
   One thing Todd doesn't seem to take well is betrayal by someone who he has given his trust to: when he believes the expedition betrayed him and activated the
   Attero device
   using his ships to test it, he is clearly furious and upset. This is also demonstrated when the
   Wraith underling
   mutinies against him and steals the
   Super-hive
   . Todd is so furious he immediately dials Atlantis to alert Sheppard about the existence of the ship and to get the team to destroy it, just to spite his former second in command, leading to the
   Battle of the Super-hive
   in which Sheppard kills the Wraith underling and destroys the ship with a
   Nuclear warhead
   . He also gives Atlantis ZPMs possibly just to spite the underling as after Sheppard points that out as a possible reason for him to help, he gives them what they want.
