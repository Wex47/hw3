   Entry into hyperspace is achieved when a vessel opens a stable hyperspace window. This allows a vessel to enter subspace and achieve faster-than-light velocities relative to real space while traveling at sublight speeds within its own layer of subspace. In this state, they can fly from one point to another in a relatively straight line. Hyperspace gives off high levels of radiation, but this is only a problem for the hulls of
   Wraith
   vessels, which are organic and unshielded.

   vessels can use neither their shields nor weapons in hyperspace, and this seems to hold true for vessels of other races as well. No reason has been given for this, but it's likely related to the difference in physical laws, or simply that maintaining hyperspace velocities require an enormous amount of power. This facet of hyperspace travel renders ships momentarily vulnerable to attack upon exiting hyperspace, assuming their aggressors know when and where the ship will exit. The subspace field which allows the vessel to enter hyperspace presumably keeps it from being torn apart, but vessels are still much more fragile in hyperspace than when combat ready, as demonstrated by

   While at its core all hyperdrive technology follows the same basics, hyperdrive technology of each race has a unique subspace frequency. A subspace interference broadcast at these frequencies destabilizes the hyperspace window of the specific hyperdrive technology, causing any vessels to be torn apart upon entering hyperspace; other hyperdrives would remain unaffected due to the differences in frequency.
