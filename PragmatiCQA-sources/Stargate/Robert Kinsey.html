   Kinsey had a
   wife
   , three children, seven grandchildren, various nieces and nephews, as well as a dog named
   Oscar
   . He was apparently particularly fond of the dog (its name was the password to the computer where he kept documentation of his illegal activities).
  </p>
  <p key="198edef2-db7b-4ecb-bbb7-f9658eef2b8e">
   Kinsey is typically portrayed as operating on an 'Earth first' policy, believing that Hammond and SG-1's philosophy of using Earth's resources to help planets in need is foolish, preferring that the Stargate be used to acquire alien technology and secure Earth's position regardless of what fate befalls other planets; on one occasion when he briefly gained control over the program, he arranged for the test of a weapon capable of destroying an entire planet simply to see if it worked, resulting in Earth being endangered when the resulting radiation threatened to return to Earth through the still-open Stargate.
  </p>
  <p key="03badba0-6a22-461f-9eb4-7d106d2a7858">
   Despite being a well-spoken politician, implying some level of charisma, Kinsey lacks the ability to inspire any loyalty thanks to his complete lack of interpersonal skills. On occasion, when managing to install his own puppets within positions of authority, he proceeds to act as though he owns them, and that they will find in his favor despite their own outlooks; such examples include President Henry Hayes and Dr. Elizabeth Weir. Once Hayes was inaugurated, Kinsey almost immediately began pushing to clean house at the SGC, becoming antagonistic when Hayes insisted on hearing all the facts. Hayes later admitted to Hammond that choosing Kinsey as his running mate was motivated purely by the latter's political pull and financial contributions to the campaign. He personally pushed Hayes to have Weir put in charge of the SGC, but when she didn't take his side during SG-1's briefing regarding the impending attack on Earth by Anubis, he outright insulted her. (

   ") Even Richard Woolsey, who at first seemed to be Kinsey's right-hand man with similar goals to dismantle the SGC, quickly turned on him after seeing Kinsey's true agenda. (

   ") This excuse is commonly presented by contemporary politicians to explain how they avoided being drafted during the
   Vietnam War
   (in reality, their social status and parentage usually have much more to do with it, though of course this is not always the case).
  </p>
  <p key="cb819712-0df9-4ab4-9acd-b17138bf0fe5">
   Kinsey often referred to "God and Country", "the Lord's work", and other phrases suggesting his possibly being religious, as well as perhaps a believer in a "manifest destiny" of the American people, although such evocative phrases are a common part of many politicians' verbal arsenal, whatever their private feelings.
