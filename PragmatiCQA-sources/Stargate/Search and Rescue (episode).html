    Joe Mallozzi
    , basically states that Vega is a lesbian when he says, "Further complications were suggested in the first draft of "Search and Rescue" with the introduction of Captain Alicia Vega who, in the episode’s final scene, essentially asks Keller out. The prospect of introducing a gay character to the Stargate universe was always an interesting possibility..." and " Of course, as Paul pointed out: “Do we really want to make this love triangle a love rectangle?”. Well, again, the decision was made for us when the episode ran waaaay too long and a good portion of Vega's scenes, including the last one, had to be cut for time".
