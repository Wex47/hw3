Later, Fung arrived at the Jade Palace, and after Po hid him from the Furious Five, explained to Po that he needed the panda's help. Apparently, Fung's brother was captured by Jong Sung Jai Kai Chow, and is held prisoner in his fort. Po eventually agreed to help rescue him, and took out most of the fort's defenses while Fung seemingly smuggled his brother out in a small box. The two went their separate ways after this. However, it was soon revealed that Fung had actually kidnapped Jong's son, with the intent to hold him for ransom. When he learned from his gang that Po had been arrested for his unknowing part in the abduction, Fung felt guilty for betraying him and returned to the fort. He arrived just as Po was about to be tortured and returned Jong's son. However, Jong demanded that they both be tortured, and Fung and Po barely escaped the fort.

   " Fung has captured Baren Sai's kid (who was just an egg) hoping to get a ransom as usual. But they are stopped by Po. They managed to knock Po out and the egg has hatched. The kid flies away while the bandits check on Po. Feeling sympathy they take him to his Mom's basement where he wakes up. Expecting him to be mad and attack them they hide under a table but are surprised to find that Po has developed amnesia and doesn't remember who he is or who they are. The bandits take advantage of this moment and lie to him saying Po was a crocodile bandit and he's the highest ranking member. Po believing this says he must be the Boss and Fung says that he's his adviser. Fung teaches him to be a bandit and uses Po to steal stuff. Po wants to rob Mr. Pings shop but knowing this will trigger his memory they stop him, convincing Po they get free noodles if they don't rob him which Po complies. When they walk out they are attacked by Tigress and Cane who were aware of Po's amnesia, try to stop him but surprisingly Po managed to take them down at ease and leaves to go back in the hide out. In the hideout Po says that since he's the boss he wants to go rob his dad. Fung is reluctant but is forced to comply. Fung and the others return and robs Mr. Ping much to the goose's horror, Fung finds action figures in Po's room which Fung discards knowing that these are Po's memories. While enjoying the loot Po is unsatisfied with what they got and wants a big heist and suggest robbing the Jade Palace. Fung is surprised and doesn't want to go along but once again Po forces him to tag along. When they arrive at the jade palace they see Shifu and the 2 battle but much to their surprise even Shifu himself. Po managed to defeat Shifu and almost kills him with a finishing move but Fung horrified at this interferes and tells Po the truth hoping this will get his memory back but it doesn't work and Po assumes this is mutiny and prepares to battle Fung luckily the Furious 5 arrive and Fung uses this to evade. But after after Po defeated the Furious 5 he prepares to kill Shifu but Fung comes back getting Po's action figures. This triggers his memory and finds out who he is but does not have memory of who he though he was before. Fung tries to tell him what happen but it doesn't work and he gives up both the subject and being a bandit and willingly tries to take himself to jail but Po having a slight change of heart ask him if they want to hang out sometimes which Po says yes and to their surprise he respectfully bows before going away to prison to turn over a new leaf.

He also have a softer side when he came back for Po when Jong Sung Jai Kai Chow captured him, when he told his Terra Cotta Warrors to stop fighting his friends, and when he stopped Po from nearly killing Shifu when they lied to him about Po being a bandit when he lost his memory.

   Fung tried to do what any son would want to do for their father: strive to please him. He had previously mentioned in past episodes how he used to help his father build
   terracotta warriors
   . But Fung also mentioned that he wasn't very good at it, and was constantly messing things up. He noted to

   It was this unchanging failure that made Fung want to go into the bandit business—something he says he's actually good at (when he later admits that he really isn't). But if he failed in the business, Fung says he will have to return to his father in constructing more warriors. He eventually does this in "Terror Cotta", but after successfully making the stone soldiers
   come to life
   , he uses them to steal and also as a substitute for his gang which had deserted him.

   After showing his father that he had successfully created a living terracotta warrior, Fung's father took command and Fung reluctantly followed. Fung's father's dream is to conquer China with an army of terracotta warriors, a dream that Fung doesn't want to do. Fung follows his father's orders until his gang is in danger, then he tries to stop him. By the end of the episode, Fung and his father reconcile after both realizing they had been projecting their inadequacies on other people.

Unfortunately, Fung and Po were not released, and had to fight their way out of Jong's castle. As Fung and Po were escaping, Fung lured Po into a pit (seen earlier in the episode) after he tried to arrest him. They regularly fight even with no provocation. They have a frenemy relationship otherwise.
