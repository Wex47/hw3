   centuries ago. Through meditation, the power of inner peace was shown when Oogway's senses were heightened immeasurably (for example he could hear a butterfly's wing beat). Inner peace thus became one of Oogway's final teachings, according to
   <a href="Shifu.html" key="b5decad0-7caf-477e-91a8-bad19315aeef" title="Shifu">
    Shifu
   </a>
   , and every kung fu master was required to learn this concept in their own way (such as meditating in a cave for fifty years while fasting, or suffering through extreme emotional pain). This final teaching apparently comes in the form of catching a water drop and redirecting it into a pool or the ground without breaking it.

   , a seemingly incompetent and hopeless panda, was chosen as the Dragon Warrior, seemingly by accident. Despite his disapproval, Shifu was forced to train him regardless, but he instead tried to give him the same kind of vigorous

   Shifu was later seen trying to meditate, but struggled to do so because of his spiritual imbalance. It was a moment later that he received word from his trusty messenger

   . He asked for help from Oogway, but the old turtle told Shifu to believe in Po. Shifu made one last promise to him to try and believe in Po's potential, and then Oogway handed him his
   staff
   and turned into peach leaves which ascended into the

   . Upon relaying this tragic news to his, Po loses his nerve and attempts to leave, but Shifu refuses to let him and demands to know why he didn't leave before. Po then reveals that the reason he chose to stay was because like the others, the panda also believed himself to be a useless slob and hoped that by staying under Shifu's tutelage, he could at least improve somewhat. Seeing that Po was just as spiritually burdened as himself, Shifu admits that he has no idea of how to help him.

   Shifu despaired until he saw Po was searching around the temple grounds for food while demonstrating his unique strength and skill. Seeing the actual potential in Po, Shifu spent the next several days training him in constant, but less vigorous ways. But despite Po's major improvement at the end of their training, Shifu still didn't believe that Po was ready to defeat Tai Lung. While he, the Furious Five, and the rest of the valley evacuated, he waited at the palace for Tai Lung. The leopard eventually arrived and

    began to fight

   with Shifu in both a physical and emotional battle. Even though Shifu was able to hold back most of Tai Lung's punches and throws, Shifu was eventually defeated. The red panda then tried apologizing to the snow leopard, admitting his shame failing as a master, hoping he could reach what little good was left in his old student and adopted son. But Tai Lung didn't care and still wanted what he thought was rightfully his. He began to strangle the life out of Shifu, but before he could finish the task, Po came to Shifu's aid and

   . Po returned to the weakened Master Shifu to report his victory, and Shifu was immensely relieved. Through his constant pain and suffering, Shifu had finally found inner peace.
