But when it seemed like Oogway was about to select Tigress, Po's final attempt with a firework chair landed him right in between the two and was declared the Dragon Warrior instead, much to everyone's surprise. Although Shifu tried to intervene, Oogway replied, "There are no accidents," and carried out with his decision. Meanwhile, the Five respectfully remain stationary, believing to have failed their master.

   student barracks
   for the night, each sharing their sarcastic doubts on Oogway's decision and throwing in numerous derogatory jokes at Po's expense (oblivious to Po's presence as he followed a small distance behind them, allowing him to hear their insults). The following day proved no different as Po showed up for a second day of severe training with Shifu and each of the Five. By this point, however, the Five took note of Po's near-unbreakable perseverance and were somewhat sympathetic towards the struggling panda as

   The Five and Po later shared a meal together in the barracks' kitchen/dining hall. Po's stories, humor, as well as his delicious noodle soup pleased the Five—excluding Tigress, who disregarded him and ate
   tofu
   instead—and caused them to warm up even more to the panda. However, when Shifu brought the news of Oogway's passing and Tai Lung's escape, the Five's doubts arose once more and they tried to reason with their master to let them stop Tai Lung. Shifu declined them, telling them it was Po's destiny to do so. Desperate to still try and do something about it, the Five ran away from the Jade Palace out into the night.

   They traveled for days before they reached the edge of the Valley where they encountered Tai Lung. All five kung fu warriors engaged in a fight of incredible skill and prowess, only to have Tai Lung come out victorious with a chi block on four of the Five—sparing Crane so he was able to carry the rest back to the Jade Palace in means of a message. Shifu and Po had just finished another day's worth of extensive training when the Five returned, Crane exhausted and the others paralyzed. The Five told about their grieving experience, which placed doubt into Po when he realized that not even his idols, let alone five kung fu masters, could stop Tai Lung. Shifu still believed he could defeat him, and they all went to the

   in the Jade Palace to retrieve the Dragon Scroll for Po. Shifu and the Five watched as Po opened the scroll, and appeared just as confused when he said it was blank. Believing nothing else could be done, Shifu offered to stay behind to hold back Tai Lung while they and the rest of the Valley escape. Master and students shared a final respectful bow, knowing that Tai Lung may very well kill him.

Marveling at his skill that enabled him to do what they could not, Tigress led the others of the Five (as well as the villagers) in a bow in respects to Po as a kung fu master, signifying Tigress' acceptance of Po as the Dragon Warrior.

He illustrated this by sharing each of the Five's individual stories of how they came to discovering one of the philosophical concepts of kung fu that helped them to ultimately better themselves:

Feeling distraught over having to choose between his responsibilities as Dragon Warrior and to his family, Po had a change of heart as he shared with the other masters his past experiences of the Winter Feast with his family. Knowing he wants to be both a good host and a good son, he quietly excused himself to fulfill that promise made to his
