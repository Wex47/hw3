   's fortune in light of his disturbing ambition regarding a lethal potential in his family's celebrated invention of fireworks. Using her soothsaying magic, the Soothsayer foretold that "if [he] continued down this dark path, he would be defeated by a

   . Such a heinous, unspeakable crime was punishable, according to Shen's father, by lifelong banishment from Gongmen. The Soothsayer was not present for Shen's banishment, but was still aware of it. The destruction of the panda village and near-extermination of the species weighed heavily on the old Soothsayer, who knew that it was her prophecy that led Shen to commit the act.

  <p key="5ab7bf49-0a3d-4402-9532-69f94e5c434a">
   For years since then, the Soothsayer had lived with the burden of her guilt, tempered by a finely-honed fatalistic sense of humor that comforted her as she awaited the events she foretold—events that she hoped would redeem both Shen and herself. She stayed with the Peacocks until the city's throne was turned over to the stewardship of the

   Some time later, Shen asked the Soothsayer to tell him what was in his future. She was initially uncooperative, plucking a feather from his wing, eating the hem of his robe, and stating the obvious when she told him about his pain, anger, and denial. But at last, she obliged and read Shen's future anyway. However, her old vision of him being defeated by a

   Eventually, Boss Wolf and his pack proved successful in capturing the panda and his comrades, the

   , the Soothsayer saw Shen practicing what he would say to the panda. She commented that he was afraid, which he denied even though it was quite obvious. When Po and the Five arrived at last, the Soothsayer went up to Po and mentioned how he had grown up bigger than she expected, finding him to be strong and healthy. Confused, Po told her to stand aside and called her "sir". He quickly apologized when

   corrected him, but the Soothsayer seemed more amused than annoyed by his mistake. Shen, however, was very annoyed until Po destroyed a miniature cannon in the throne room instead of the real one. Laughing, he asked the Soothsayer if she really believed Po was the warrior destined to defeat him, and she replied that she knew he was.
  </p>
  <p key="d448debd-765f-4bf3-9db2-b1830baf8c31">
   However, it soon became clear that Po did not remember anything about Shen or his role in the destruction of
   his old home

   </a>
   . This surprised the Soothsayer, but she had no time to explain anything as the prisoners quickly broke free of their chains and destroyed the cannon in the throne room. She watched when Po lunged to attack Shen, but he froze suddenly, giving the peacock just enough time to escape from the tower through an open window. The shocked Soothsayer was then carried out of the tower by a gorilla guard and was brought to the

  <p key="ebbbb3fd-84e1-4163-858c-cd83c6e772e4">
   Shen later gloated to the Soothsayer that she was wrong about Po, since the panda had failed to defeat him. But she only criticized Shen for destroying his ancestral home and asked if conquering China would finally satisfy him. When arguing with him failed to change his mind, the Soothsayer tried to reason with Shen and begged him to stop so his

His cold response to this news made it very clear to the Soothsayer that he was determined to follow this path of destruction. Shen then ordered his guards to set her free. Deeply saddened, she told him goodbye and wished him happiness as she left.

   Panda Village
   and set about nursing him back to health. When Po woke up, he tried to sneak away from her, but she caught him and made him drink a cup of bad-tasting medicinal tea. She then told Po that she had saved him so that he could fulfill his destiny. When he expressed confusion, she said she was surprised by how little he remembered from when "it" happened. Suddenly, painful memories began flaring inside Po's mind. When she saw him in distress, she suspected that he remembered more than he realized, and that his so-called "nightmares" were really repressed memories coming back to the surface.

  <p key="b4f538d6-6a2c-4577-a7c8-af850b45a676">
   To help Po find the truth, the Soothsayer explained to him about the prophecy she had made years ago, when Shen's parents had come to her with fears about their ambitious son's future. She had foreseen that a panda would stand in Shen's way; however, she did not foresee that Shen would attack the Panda Village in order to prevent this. Po then remembered that his
   father
   had saved him from Shen's wolves, but it was too painful for him to see after his
   mother
   carried him off. The Soothsayer advised him to "stop fighting [and instead] let it flow." He did this by performing the special "

   . Sensing that he had seen the truth of his past, the Soothsayer told him that it was his choices that determined his identity. This helped Po to let go of his pain, accept the present, and decide to defeat Shen for good.

   While being by Lord Shen's side, she tried her best to make him reconsider his actions and take another path, given that she knows that if he doesn't, it will end with his demise. Despite his clear dislike of this trait, Shen considered the Soothsayer the only person besides himself he genuinely cared about, given that he had set her free in the oncoming pursuit of his plans rather than executing or imprisoning her in jail. The Soothsayer's wisdom was not to be taken lightly, and also seemed to possess a fatalistic, yet positive, perspective of her fortune-telling, as she displayed unwavering faith that Shen would indeed fall at the hands of

   The Soothsayer also has great regard for history and tradition, as shown when she angrily lambasted Shen for destroying the Tower of the Sacred Flame, which had been the Peacocks' ancestral home for centuries.

   Shen and Soothsayer are shown to have a very odd relationship. Soothsayer was Shen's nanny when he was young, and she loved him very much.
   However, Shen seemed to have lost almost all love for her after he was banished. The two of them also tend to act antagonistically towards each other. (For example, Soothsayer would often bite the hem off of Shen's robes—much to his annoyance—and Shen seemed to take amusement in trying to intimidate her, such as commenting on how he'd like to turn the

   Soothsayer's clothing consists of eight layers of cloth, all with different patterns and colors. This was specifically designed by character designer Nicolas Marlet based on an image of a
   Tibetan woman
   .
   On the back of the topmost layer of clothing is a large, round, golden symbol resembling the sun with a swirling black design resembling vines on the inside. The Soothsayer also wears a pair of glasses and has five black beads in her beard. To help her walk in her old age, the Soothsayer makes use of an extremely gnarled and bent walking stick.
