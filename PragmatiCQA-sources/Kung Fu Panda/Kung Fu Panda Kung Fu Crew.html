   to fight off the "

However, stepping onto the platform only activated yet another trap as arrows were set off, targeted at them. Having an idea, Po reacted by jumping off, snapping one of the chains that helped hold the logs in the air, and kicking it up to serve as a shield for the arrows. Seeing this was effective, the Five followed his example with success.

   Po thanked the Five for their help, and a ladder was offered to them from the guards, who were alarmed when they heard a rumbling noise, thinking it was another trap, only to find was Po's stomach growling.

   was anticipating a package in the mail, but discovered that it was taken, along with the whole mail cart, by a gang of crows, and that such incidents had been happening a lot recently. To uncover the reason for this, Po had

   <a href="Qinchu.html" key="7b988556-c9c7-48bc-bc67-9771d3f42368" title="Qinchu">

   . Qinchu told the panda he was trespassing and made no room for argument, declaring that he had worked hard to create order in the city by keeping outsiders out and residents in. With that, he ordered his crows to throw the panda out, and Po was tossed down Mount Penglai.
  </p>
  <p key="6b456598-8531-43cc-94cc-2d7013b587da">
   When he awoke from the painful fall, Po met the former official and his son, who had similarly been thrown down Mount Penglai. Po learned about Qinchu's takeover of the city as well as his goal to find the key to Mount Penglai, which was the reason for the hijacking of so many mail carts, as the key was always passed from one location to another so none could ever know its exact whereabouts. In his quest for a "paradise" of order and organization, Qinchu aimed to use the key to lock the gates and isolate the city.
  </p>
  <p key="a0413b68-4c0c-43a4-8f79-9c04316824a1">
   After hearing this, Po took action and crashed through the roof of the palace. He faced Qinchu in a showy display, and the fox stood before him, unimpressed. After some back-and-forth banter, the two engaged in combat. This resulted in Po kicking Qinchu and throwing him down, where he then trapped the fox in a roll of carpet. He then told Qinchu it was about time he meet his "public", with the palace door opening to reveal many angry citizens of Mount Penglai, including the former-official and his son. They took Qinchu and carried him away, resolving to have him thrown down the mountain himself. Later, the official's young son came to Po, joyfully showing him an action-figure in Po's likeness. It was the very package the panda had been looking forward to, but Po decided instead to let the boy keep it, and then resolved to help deliver the rest of the missing mail.
