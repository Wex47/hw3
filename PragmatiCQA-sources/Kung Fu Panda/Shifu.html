   After becoming a master, Shifu became overwhelmed by the mass of new responsibilities that was placed upon him. As a result, Shifu became internally unbalanced (or, as Shifu himself stated, "trapped in transition"), and at one point, this resulted in him getting beaten up by a dummy on a rope. The stress soon became too much for Shifu and he removed his master's robe, preparing to quit kung fu and return to his old life. However, Oogway stopped him and kindly proceeded to teach him "

To his utter surprise, the unlikely band of heroes managed to triumph, saving the valley of peace from Boar.

The news instantly set them in an uproar, making Tigress and the other Five leave the palace to try and stop Tai Lung on their own while Shifu attempted to stop a panicking Po from leaving. This led to an argument with Po, who calls Shifu out by reminding him that he had been trying to get rid of him since he arrived and treated him like he was nothing. Shifu admitted this, but pointed out that Po had chosen to stay despite everything. Shifu then learned that the panda had a deep self-loathing, as Po revealed he had taken all the abuse because he considered it better than being himself, and asked Shifu how is he gonna change him into a dragon master, but Shifu says he doesn't know. Faced with a student so physically and spiritually burdened, Shifu soon began to share Po's doubts that he could train him into the Dragon Warrior, and departed.

Realizing that the key to teaching Po was through proper motivation (food), he proceeded to take Po to the

   and lifted the panda's spirits by simply asserting he had faith in him for the attempt. With that accomplished, Shifu started training Po in the art of kung fu in an entirely new way, climaxing in a fight of "keep-away" with a dumpling. When Po finally bested Shifu at the game, and then demonstrated his emotional growth by declining to eat it as a sign of his overcoming his psychological dependence on food, he knew that Po was ready to receive the

After reversing the nerve strike effects on his students, Shifu reassured them all that even though Tai Lung had gotten stronger, the Dragon Warrior (Po) would beat him by attaining the power from the Dragon Scroll. However, upon opening the scroll, it was revealed that it was blank.

   With nothing else left to do, Shifu told Po and the Furious Five to evacuate the Valley. He would stay behind and hold off Tai Lung long enough to make sure that everyone would be safe, even though he knew that the price would cost him his life. Preparing himself, he awaited Tai Lung's arrival, and when the leopard showed up, the two engaged in violent combat. The fight was evenly matched for a long time, until Tai Lung renewed his vicious attacks on the aging master, screaming accusations and taunts before demanding to be told of how proud Shifu was of him. Badly wounded and defeated, Shifu knew that this was his one last chance at making amends with his former son and student, and apologized; telling him that he was indeed proud of him, and that Shifu's pride had blinded him to what Tai Lung was becoming. After a moment of clear indecision, Tai Lung hardened his heart and grasped his master by the throat tightly, proclaiming that he wasn't after an apology—he still wanted the scroll. Upon seeing the scroll missing, he nearly strangled and killed Shifu before the timely arrival of Po saved him.

   on Tai Lung, Shifu was mistaken by Po to be dying, but he had merely found peace after confronting his greatest mistakes. In the aftermath of the great fight, Shifu has found it in himself to let go of his bitterness, and is slowly, but surely, opening himself back up to his students while continuing Po's training.

   Throughout the series, Shifu is shown to be generally enigmatic and calm, but on rare occasion also displays a playful side. In one episode, he was seen playing with the action figures of his kung fu hero and had also asked Po to teach him how to loosen up in another episode. In the same episode, Shifu was also seen dancing for the first time (which was a plot to take off the chains that

Po presumed that there would dancing and sun-lanterns at the event, but Shifu corrected him by stating that the feast was traditionally and strictly formal, to which Po quickly agreed. Suddenly, a pig ran up to warn Po that a group of boar bandits were currently attacking the

   Once Po was finished with the bandits, Shifu began to explain to him the myriad of responsibilities and instructions involved with the Winter Feast at the Jade Palace. These burdened Po, but he tried suggesting that he invite his father to the feast, only for Shifu to refuse him, noting how guests were not allowed. Though he could understand wanting to spend a holiday with his father, Shifu reminded Po that he still had his duties as the Dragon Warrior.

   When it came to hiring a chef to cater to the feast, Po dismissed them all and failed to convince his father to help. Therefore, Po was left to prepare everything for the feast all by himself. Eventually, he came to enlist the help of the Furious Five in finishing the preparations on time, right up to Shifu's exact specifications. But when Po was finally seated with the other

He promptly left the palace to assist his father in cooking at the restaurant. Shifu began to panic that Po would completely skip out on the Jade Palace's formal feast and pleaded somebody to do something; a goose singer amateurishly tried to sing, only making Shifu groan.

   The Five and all the other masters, moved by Po's loyalty, made their way to the Noodle Shop to celebrate the holiday with him. Shifu followed them, grumbling about how Po ruined something so perfect. But upon seeing the happy celebration in the shop, Shifu came to appreciate Po's decision, and Po invited him inside, telling him that he was part of his family as well.

   Shifu was teaching Po with a dummy hung from a rope when the panda was knocked down, appearing to be distracted. The red panda goes on to ask what was distracting him, and Po responds by saying he had a dream about "another self" who knew his moves before he made them. Shifu ponders about the dream until the next day, when Shifu teaches him balance. He begins by telling him about when

Po appeared to be getting better at the art, but still was lacking balance, and at one point was 'flung' into a tree by a vase, much to Shifu's surprise and exasperation. Shifu was also taken aback when he learned that Po mistook him for a raccoon, and eventually decided to call it a day. That night, Po returns to the noodle shop to find his father being held hostage by an antelope named Kuo. Shifu witnesses Po beat the antelope by balancing on the knives

But their success convinced Lord Shen to ruthlessly fire one of his cannons at the wreckage of boats the masters had created, which exploded everything and everyone in front of him. The masters were all left floating on pieces of the remaining wreckage in the harbor, all hope seemingly lost. Shifu saw Po climb up onto a piece of floating timber and face Shen's fleet, seemingly trying to sacrifice himself to save his friends.

After Po defeated Shen, he congratulated Po on finding inner peace "at such a young age", which he added sourly. But Po then told him he had a great teacher. He then attempted to hug Shifu, only for him to mysteriously reappear behind him. Shifu and the other masters stayed for the city's celebration and watched as fireworks decorated the golden sky.

   He also appears to have a bit of a devious side, and before befriending Po, was shown to have a cruel sense of humor. This was shown from the moment Shifu met Po, as he seemed to take delight in trying to drive the amateurish panda away, slowly turning up the heat with every challenge he gave Po and chuckling to himself at his incompetence.
  </p>
  <p key="d3fa6c71-9f85-426b-a5c1-d92ac589712c">
   Shifu also exhibits sarcasm. This is seen when he reprimanded the Furious Five to be "doing well if they were trying to disappoint him" when they failed to defeat him in a training session earlier in the first film. He also regarded the existence of a "Level Zero" when Po failed at his first day of training.

   's every word closely. He exhibited this when he did nothing regarding his master's rejection of his beloved student Tai Lung as the

   and teaching with dynamism. These traits effectively enabled him to see the key to training Po, as seen when instead of reprimanding the latter regarding his "food outbursts", he simply used this knowledge to develop Po's instinctive "food skills" into tremendous kung fu strength, thus paving the way for Po to defeat Tai Lung and ultimately lending a hand in bringing peace to himself.

   Since the events of the first film, Shifu seems to be a much warmer and more understanding master. He has started to show a gentler nature reflecting that of Oogway's. His attitude also changed drastically towards Po—while Po's antics still perplex and frustrate him, he seems to have faith in the panda and a growing confidence in his abilities after underestimating him so many times. For instance, in
   <i key="c9e9079c-2ea9-4e9c-9ee9-11b41f416f83">
    <a href="Secrets of the Furious Five.html" key="35f41cc9-ce2c-4832-ae4e-76ae09a5e132" title="Secrets of the Furious Five">

    </a>
   </i>
   , without previous warning he assigned Po to teach the introductory class to kung fu for young children, expecting him to struggle at such a mature task, only to find the panda excels at it.
   Furthermore, when he assigned Po to host, cook for, and basically direct the preparation for the refined
   <a href="Winter Feast.html" key="dcde749a-2c14-44e1-b006-9dd96f92e47c" title="Winter Feast">

   , he exhibited great pride in him when the task was done.
  </p>
  <p key="94e106a3-fb94-4d96-a7a8-cc6ae9b3add9">
   Shifu still seems to struggle with the "illusion of control", as first mentioned by Oogway in the first film. He wanted everything to run perfectly for the Feast, seemingly adamant that the duties and traditions of kung fu were above all others in a warrior's life. And, just when Shifu was praising Po on such exemplary preparation for the Winter Feast, he was beyond shocked when the panda suddenly took his leave. This was followed by a moment of panic when he saw that the smooth course of the evening would have been disrupted, and soon believed that it was seemingly ruined. It wasn't until he went down to the
   noodle shop
   and saw the joyous gathering for himself that he came to appreciate Po's unusual decision.
  </p>
  <p key="fec42906-90b3-46ec-8333-3b9700b5cea7">
   Yet, while still holding firm to the (formal) traditions of the Feast, Shifu's devious side is still apparent—this time, in favor of aiding Po rather than torturing him. This shows when Shifu prompted Po to recite the opening words of the
   <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvQ3JlZWRfb2ZfdGhlX01hc3RlcnM/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x" key="61346a93-4de6-4522-acc3-7eb81c01b42f" title="Creed of the Masters (page does not exist)">

   , to which Po couldn't bring himself to do from the guilt of leaving his father. Shifu then quietly mentioned to him that he had a feeling he would forget the words, so he wrote them on Po's napkin.

    Even though he has been elevated to Oogway's position as spiritual leader of the Valley of Peace, Shifu is still a few steps shy of enlightenment. Though he tries his best, he strains under the pressure and responsibilities of stepping into such big shoes. Some times... all right most times, Po's antics can still send his old master searching for calm in a cup of hot tea and a meditative chant of 'Inner peace... Inner peace...'

He did this twice in the first film, when he sparred with Po and when he fought Tai Lung.

   staff
   before he ascended into the Heavens. Shifu kept the staff, as well as his promise. He trained Po and soon came to believe he really was the Dragon Warrior. And after Po defeated Tai Lung, Shifu saw that Oogway's prophecy about him had come true.

   and was returning, Shifu sought help from Oogway, still convinced that Po wasn't the Dragon Warrior and couldn't possibly stop Tai Lung. Before passing away, Oogway assured him that the panda could indeed stop Tai Lung, if Shifu would only guide and believe in him. After sharing the news with his students (Shifu unamused as Po had been mimicking him at the time), Po was alarmed and fled after hearing that he was the only one who could stop Tai Lung.

   Shifu stopped him outside the palace stairs, and the two argued, with Po asking the master why he'd been trying to get rid of him, and that neither of them thought he was the Dragon Warrior. Shifu asked him why he hadn't quit in spite of everything, and was taken aback when Po admitted that being beat and humiliated was still better than living every day being himself, and hoped that by staying, the kung fu master could change him. When Po demanded just how Shifu could actually help him to win against Tai Lung, Shifu was at a loss and quietly retreated without an answer.

   , eating everything he could find in his distraught state. Shifu was astounded to see that Po displayed an unintentional talent in kung fu while trying to rummage the place for more food, even making a perfect split while doing so. Shifu understood that the best way to teach him was to use food as motivation, and with that, he took the panda to the

   . He proclaimed that he would be Po's master and would teach him kung fu, much to the elation of the panda. During an intense period of training, the two formed a bond of friendship and trust, and Shifu saw Po's mastery and humility in a final test of "keep away" using a dumpling as the prize. Though Po won, he gave back the dumpling, declaring with confidence that he wasn't hungry, and ended bowing respectfully to his master, with Shifu bowing to him in return.

   , and used his name instead of calling him "panda" when addressing him. But when the scroll turned out to be blank, both Shifu and Po were confused, and Shifu did not see how Po could defeat the snow leopard on his own. With Tai Lung approaching, he ordered the Five to evacuate the Valley, while he would fight Tai Lung himself. Po was reluctant to let Shifu fight alone, afraid he would be killed, but he obeyed and left with the Five. Once he reunited with his

He also appeared to be slightly jealous that Po had mastered
