   Sometime later, the Soothsayer was brought before Shen, who gloated that the panda she had believed to be a powerful warrior was, in fact, a fool. Ignoring Shen's threats, the Soothsayer told Shen that the path he had chosen would never bring satisfaction, and urged him to stop his plans. When she brought up his parents, Shen angrily stated that they had both hated and wronged him. He was then momentarily struck speechless when the Soothsayer revealed that his parents had loved him so much that they had died of grief soon after banishing him. Despite this revelation, Shen chose to continue with his plans and had the Soothsayer released. The Soothsayer sadly bade Shen farewell and left.

   Shen, unknowingly ruining the Five's plan to destroy the building by doing so. However, Shen had anticipated his arrival and took the panda by surprise in the upper levels of the building. When Po demanded answers, Shen claimed that his parents had abandoned him before attacking. As the two fought, Shen easily outmaneuvered Po until cornered at the highest level of the factory. Unperturbed, Shen teased Po again, telling him that his parents had never loved him. This emotional attack again distracted Po, which was enough for Shen to reach his most powerful cannon, which he then used to blast Po out of the factory and into the river.

   Confident that Po was dead, Shen had the recaptured Furious Five chained up and suspended above his ships as they sailed out of the city, planning on executing them once his ships reached the harbor. He even callously blasted a bridge out of the way when Gongmen citizens came to watch. Much to his shock, Po returned to rescue his friends and to defeat Shen once and for all. Shen ordered his gunners to blast him, but Po nimbly moved along the rooftops, preventing them from getting a clear shot, and then jumped onto the ships to engage Shen's army, now that they couldn't fire without hitting their men.

   . Unfazed, Shen ordered his gunners to open fire and finish off the panda, to which Po began making
   tai chi
   motions. The first cannon was fired, and amazingly, Po used a technique Shifu had shown him earlier to catch and deflect the cannonball. Though shocked at this, Shen would not relent and ordered his men to continue firing. However, Po continued to deflect the cannon fire and soon began sending the cannonballs back towards the boats and destroying them. Shen became increasingly enraged and ordered his men to fire from his cannon. Po caught this larger cannonball, and as he began spinning on the spot with this ball, he briefly transformed into the
   Yin Yang
   symbol from the Soothsayer's vision, a sight which struck Shen speechless. Po redirected this last ball into Shen's ship, which then destroyed what remained of Shen's armada, though Shen survived the impact.

Po told Shen that it was time to let go of his past, stating that what mattered was who he chose to be in the present. Shen agreed and declared his choice: by attacking Po with his sword and knives in one last vengeful attempt to kill the panda. Though Shen's swordplay overwhelmed Po, as they fought, Shen accidentally cut through the ropes holding the remains of his cannon. Shen realized this too late, and as the heavy weapon fell on him, he closed his eyes and accepted his fate, resulting in a great explosion that sunk the main ship to the waters, of which Po barely managed to evade. Soon afterward, fireworks were set off over Gongmen City, with the image of a peacock appearing in the morning sky.

   Shen is shown to have been extremely rational, ambitious, destructive, powerful, and supremely lethal. His past forged in him the notion that he would have been wronged, and that the world owed him something, and he sought to do everything in his power to take it. This included inventing a
   powerful weapon
   unlike anyone had ever seen. Shen was intent on using this weapon to wipe out

   Shen proclaims himself to be a benevolent monarch for his technological achievements. But the truth is, he is nothing but a power-hungry child driven by misguided vengeance and will slash away everything that gets in his way.

   Shen was shown to be unspeakably merciless and monstrously ruthless, as he was ready to enact

  <p key="bc2e7231-cdfb-40c3-a7fc-01778fabcc46">
   His ambition to leave his mark on the world drove him to find a dark and lethal potential in his family's celebrated invention of fireworks, and when cast out by his parents for his massacre of the pandas, he swore revenge and aimed to conquer all of China just to prove himself. Shen had little or no regard for the lives or well-being of others, as he blasted a bridge without hesitation, despite there being innocent bystanders on it, and was willing to
   sacrifice his own troops

   from the collapsing Tower of the Sacred Flame, he got mad and kicked one of his gorilla followers in the nose. Additionally, when he ordered Boss Wolf to gather the wolves shortly after the incident, he hollered at him repetitively to do the task even after the wolf hurried away to do so.
  </p>
  <p key="59374950-71ac-47e2-8030-8e74fc1b852e">
   Shen also seemed to have a low tolerance for pain (despite being a seasoned master of kung fu and swordsmanship), as when the Soothsayer plucked out one of his smallest down feathers, he yelped audibly and pulled his wing-back while he was acting as if he were badly wounded. He also did not care about tradition and ancestry, as he ordered his minions to bring down the Tower of the Sacred Flame even though it would have been his family's ancestral home for over twenty years.

  <p key="1edf406a-5689-4388-8dee-15bf2f1bbfdb">
   Prideful and possibly deranged, Shen seemed to carry little to no remorse for his crimes, and would often boast of his accomplishments. He was also shown to be sadistic, as seen while he was

   over there staining the wall." showing he was rather bloodthirsty. He also took pleasure in telling Po his parents did not love him while he was taking advantage of the panda's pain in the process. This cruelty likely stemmed from Shen's conviction that his parents hated him, which was forged in his mind when they exiled him years ago. Shen's bitterness against his parents went as far as to insulting his father's memory by throwing his throne out the window and replacing it with his cannon, even after commenting that he had fond memories of playing around it as a kid.
  </p>
  <p key="7b070dbb-5313-48e6-aabe-c7f095eb81e3">
   The Soothsayer, however, opposed his plans. She tried to reason with Shen to change his ways and, even while she was being his prisoner and displaying acts of occasional ridicule towards him, displayed her concern for the reckless decisions he made. Despite his conviction that his parents wronged and hated him, she related that his parents loved him so much that they died of grief after they had to exile him. Although he paused in thoughtful silence upon hearing this, Shen hardened his heart, freed and dismissed the Soothsayer, and proceeded with his
   conquest

  <p key="0981d46b-19ce-4625-a8a8-fd772e9a40c9">
   Shen also excelled in sword and lance combat and hid a plethora of blades in his robes, which he could unleash with lightning speed and deadly precision. Among the rest of his arsenal was his lance (which he was seen practicing with the most), and a pair of lethal-looking metal talons. All in all, Shen's fighting style was both graceful and lethal. When enraged, however, Shen was more reckless, as shown by his ferocious assault on Po which caused him to not realize that he was severing the ropes that held up his cannon, ultimately crushing him.
  </p>
  <p key="ac6963b4-099b-4bc3-b5ff-6f813a43b67f">
   When Shen engaged someone in close combat, not one move he made was wasted. He made full and efficient use of every technique, weapon, and tactic he had at his disposal, utilizing not only his bladed weapons but also his tail and talons. As shown in his fight with Masters Storming Ox and Croc, he used his sword to pin Ox's weapons while using a sidekick on Croc, and then immediately turning that side-kick into a roundhouse-kick to knock Ox down.
  </p>
  <p key="82699c49-0632-4f25-9d15-66ce06db4f3b">
   Due to Shen's physiology, he was far more capable of spinning or sweeping maneuvers, as well as pinning someone's weapons or limbs, and was also capable of using his tail to sweep foes off their feet, as he had done so in his
   <a href="Battle of the Tower of Sacred Flame.html" key="931f5325-2241-4912-9993-b6b38b445083" title="Battle of the Tower of Sacred Flame">
    first fight with Po
   </a>
   where he grabbed Po's foot, stopping a kick before he pinned it down, maneuvered around Po, and he swept the panda off balance with his long tail feathers.
   His tail was used to defend and distract his foes and even mask his movements. One example shows in how he had come very close to killing Croc when he used his tail in a series of moves: first, he defended with his tail; then he attempted to stab Croc with his sword (which he barely managed to dodge); and then he finally finished it with a butterfly kick on Croc's head. In battle, his tail became another limb, which he could shape and use to attack, defend, or as a deception tool. His "Funnel Cloud Attack" and "Feather Attack" were noted to be daunting and deadly.

  <p key="9cae629d-945f-4d91-9999-8e373c31e5fd">
   Ultimately, Shen's fighting style stemmed from a combination of his peacock physiology and royal background. He preferred the use of his agility, speed, bladed weaponry, knowledge of gunpowder and army of followers to outmaneuver and overpower his adversaries.

However, it was revealed through the Soothsayer that Shen's parents loved him so much that the pain of banishing their son broke their hearts and caused their deaths. Shen was stricken silent in response to this but didn't dispute the matter any further while hardening his heart and proceeding with his plan.

However, while Shen did insult and threaten her on some occasions, he tolerated her and never harmed her. She was perhaps the only one person Shen ever cared for or showed mercy to, as he released her from

   Boss Wolf was Shen's most loyal and trusted subordinate. He displayed much confidence in Boss Wolf's abilities and competence, and Boss Wolf displayed in return great loyalty, as well as some fear, of his master. However, Shen wasn't above reprimanding Boss Wolf on certain occasions and showed that, while he valued Boss Wolf as his second-in-command, he cared nothing for him. This was shown when Shen ordered Boss Wolf to fire the
   cannon
   at their enemies, to which Boss Wolf hesitated since their troops would be caught in the blast as well. Boss Wolf finally disobeyed his master for possibly the first time, due to seeing Shen for what he was, and was quickly dealt with as Shen promptly struck him with a throwing knife. Shen displayed no remorse for this act and simply aimed to win the
   battle

   Shen wore a long, white robe held with a black-colored belt. The robe is made from "the finest silk in the province", according to Shen.
   Sewn along the edges of the robe is silver silk patterned with flame-like designs. On the back of the robe is an emblem of a flying bird (presumably a peacock) with its tail feathers on fire.

   During the film's production, the surfacing team struggled to make the robes look visually interesting, as white doesn't typically look as such. Head of Surfacing Wes Burian explains that Shen's robes were "crafted by using panels of silk woven in an anisotropic direction that are sewn as squares alternating in their pattern," resulting in an interesting visual without changing the color.
