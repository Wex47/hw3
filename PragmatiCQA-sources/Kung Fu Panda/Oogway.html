   , who was carelessly pranking the villagers and "pantsing" anyone who tried to stop him. The old master confronted the young troublemaker and directly told him to leave. When challenged to a duel to determine who would leave the village, Oogway found himself surrounded by Monkey's banana peels, but was unaffected, and ended up pulling Monkey out of harm's way when he himself slipped as a pillar fell from behind.

   Amazed, the defeated Monkey asked why he saved him. Oogway shared with him his admiration of the young warrior's skills, but also sensed great pain in him, and saw the reason for Monkey's mischievous behavior, as he had been laughed at when his own pants fell in public as a child. Distraught and humiliated in front of the whole village, the young Monkey surrendered, turning to leave, but Oogway stopped him; rather than making him leave the village as per the challenge, he encouraged him to stay and use his skills for good. Inspired by the wise master's compassion, Monkey started to become a good warrior by helping others, treating them the way he would want to be treated.

However, Oogway had watched Tai Lung's training and seeing the darkness in the prideful snow leopard's heart, rejected Tai Lung as the Dragon Warrior without hesitation and could not be persuaded by Shifu to reconsider, causing Shifu to bow down reluctantly to Oogway's words and Tai Lung to become enraged.

He commented on the lack of faith Po showed in himself, and encouraged the panda to live for the present instead of worrying about what was and what would be. Po followed his advice the next day and survived through Shifu's strict training exercises with optimism.

Oogway told Shifu that he must let go of the "illusion of control", and instead nurture and believe in Po's abilities in order for him to stop Tai Lung, demonstrating this metaphor by planting a peach seed that Shifu pulled from one of the peaches of the tree. Shifu still displayed confusion and doubt, but Oogway reassured him one more time that he must believe, and Shifu committed to trying. Nearly a millennium of teaching and developing kung fu, the greatly aged tortoise sensed his time had come, and handed Shifu his

   . Also developed by Oogway, the Dragon Scroll is a scroll containing the ultimate secret to kung fu—"the key to limitless power." However, when the scroll was unveiled, it was discovered the inside was nothing but a reflective sheet. Oogway had understood the simple knowledge that one must only believe in himself to achieve "excellence of self," and therefore, there was no actual written secret.

He would also resort to more extreme methods to teach lessons, as shown when he threw Croc, Rhino, and Ox into the

   Though at times he could seem senile with his puzzling ways, Oogway was incredibly wise and rational, and gave great advice using strong and witty metaphors to emphasize his points. Oogway also had a playful side, and would sometimes poke fun at others, perhaps as a test of their patience or simply for his own amusement. He was shown to almost always be kind and content, even when he knew he was about to pass on.

   The third film reveals Oogway was once a bellicose warmonger with great ambitions, having led a massive army with his brother-in-arms Kai. After the ancient pandas healed the injuries he had from the previous war, Oogway transitioned from the ambitious and truculent warlord he was to the judicious and honorable Kung Fu master beloved and respected by all. When Kai was not able to make the same transition and even began to steal the Chi of Pandas, Oogway was ready, albeit reluctantly, to exile Kai into the Spirit Realm.

   , and as such, they had led a great army together. One day, they were ambushed by an enemy army and Oogway was badly injured. Despite the perilous journey, Kai himself had carried his beloved friend to help, to the pandas, who could heal and restore life with the power of chi. The loyal bonds that united the tortoise and yak were shaken upon Oogway's realization that Kai was after the power over chi, and though it pained him to do so, Oogway dueled Kai in an earth-shaking battle which ended with Kai being banished to the Spirit Realm, body and soul. Centuries later, Oogway was confronted by Kai after he too had ascended to the Spirit Realm. By this time, Kai had became completely driven with anger over Oogway's betrayal and even more powerful than before. Although Kai defeated Oogway, it was shown that Oogway willingly let himself be defeated so that Po could defeat Kai and complete his destiny as the Dragon Warrior, which he outright stated to Kai, leaving it unclear if Oogway could have defeated Kai had he actually wanted to stop him.

  <p key="73a167f0-ea0c-42e6-a98a-c3eb704fae0a">
   Although Kai would often comment on how he wished to completely destroy Oogway's legacy, he did refer to Oogway as Master Oogway, suggesting a measure of respect for Oogway was still there. Oogway himself interacted with Kai rather cordially, even calling him old friend at one point, but his initial casual demeanor changed when he learned Kai had taken the chi of every master in the Spirit Realm, for the first time making Oogway ever show horror before shifting to frustration on how Kai had many years to think on his actions but never learned that he could never fulfill his goal of domination. Oogway showed no sadness when Kai was vanquished by Po either, showing that any bond between them has long since died (though it's not entirely implausible for Oogway to have still felt grief), though at least unlike Kai Oogway didn't have much resentment for Kai or at least not at the level of hatred.

The tortoise even supported Tigress when she volunteered to deliver Shifu's message, and later suggested that it had been no accident to bring back an entirely different group of recruits. He later went to the tigress as she sat bemoaning her "failure" but again expressed his conviction that she could not be Shifu; she had to be herself. He may have even considered selecting Tigress as the Dragon Warrior since he appeared to be pointing in her direction during the

Not only did Oogway win their fight, but he saved Monkey from being crushed under a falling pillar. The old master then complimented the young warrior's skill, but he also sensed great pain in him. Reminded of being humiliated himself in his youth, Monkey was about to leave the village, ashamed and defeated. Oogway instead convinced him to stay and use his skills for good. Following his advice, Monkey soon became a hero to the townspeople and followed Oogway's example by treating others with compassion.

Upon discovering the escape of the Wu Sisters, Oogway decided to involve the trio in "a battle worth fighting" in the hopes that it would help them to unlock their true potential. He had to persuade the three to accompany him, promising them "riches" though he failed to correct them at the time that he spoke of spiritual wealth rather than money. However, his ultimate aim was always to help them become better, and in the end he was gratified to learn that they had finally learned to look beyond themselves.

He was clearly displeased with how Tai Lung became prideful, as a flashback had him observe Tai Lung's training with clear disappointment, and when Shifu presented Tai Lung to Oogway to be nominated the Dragon Warrior, Oogway did not hesitate to reject Tai Lung and remained firm even as Shifu tried to defend Tai Lung. This combined with Shifu bowing to Oogway's refusal enraged Tai Lung and he waste to the

Despite knowing his time would soon come, effectively meaning that seemingly no one could defeat Tai Lung as he was the only Kung Fu master who could defeat the snow leopard, Oogway remained confident until his death that the real Dragon Warrior, Po, despite his appearance, could defeat Tai Lung in his absence and it proved to be true as Po was able to defeat Tai Lung once and for all, sending him to the Spirit Realm with the Wuxi Finger Hold. Tai Lung in return resented the master ever since he was imprisoned and took delight in breaking his staff.

   Aside from Shifu, little is known of Oogway's relationship with other members of the previous Furious Five. He took a special interest in training Fenghuang due to her vast potential, but he was not blinded to her growing ambition and corruption. Anticipating that she might follow in the path of the other most powerful members of the Furious Five who had turned to evil, he prepared an Owl-shaped cage to contain her, and unveiled it after she challenged him for mastery of the Jade Palace. He achieved victory, but she fled rather than face capture; the fear of Oogway kept her in exile for a number of years.
