   of the darkness in Tai Lung's heart. He refused him the title, surprising and disappointing both Shifu and Tai Lung, and Tai Lung looked to his master and father-figure for support, only to be further dismayed when Shifu did nothing to object to Oogway's decision.

   Confused and outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the

Still furious that Shifu had let Oogway's decision stand, Tai Lung did not hesitate to knock Shifu aside, shattering his hip before he leaped for the scroll. He was halted in midair by Oogway, who jabbed multiple pressure points in Tai Lung's chest, blocking his

   restraining tortoise shell
   , with various acupuncture needles in crucial places along his back, keeping his chi blocked, interfering with his breathing to the minimum and making him almost fully immobile.

He then simply cracked the other and parried and reshot another arrow. Realizing he could use them to reach the elevator, Tai Lung threw and kicked four arrows onto the mountain wall and used to fifth to leap onto them. By swinging from one to another, he managed to grab onto the elevator an inch before hundreds of arrows descended. Using it he got higher and used the chain to repel onto the higher floors. Driven by his insatiable fury, Tai Lung unleashed his

   In a last attempt to outsmart Tai Lung, Vachir ordered the bridge to be destroyed by setting off explosives attached to the roof of the prison, making falling chunks of rock the size of boulders smash into the walkway Tai Lung was standing on. Thinking quickly, Tai Lung rapidly leaped from rock to falling rock, finally reaching the last bundle of explosives that had yet to be set off—and tossed it among the guards as it exploded, blasting open the heavy doors and finishing off Commander Vachir and the remaining guards.

   By the time Tai Lung finally arrived at the Jade Palace, the whole Valley had been evacuated on Shifu's orders, leaving only the master himself to confront Tai Lung at the palace steps. Tai Lung told Shifu he has come home and respectfully calls him "Master." Shifu's reception of his son and a one-time student was cautious and cold as he tells him the Jade Palace is no longer his home and that he is no longer his master, bluntly making it clear they were now enemies. Tai Lung asks Shifu where Po is and if he scared him off. Shifu challenges Tai Lung to a battle; when he asks if that is how it is going to be, Shifu retorts that that is how it must be as he prepares to engage in battle. Enraged, Tai Lung leaped into the air and cracked the Jade Palace steps and then lifted a giant rock and kicked it against Shifu. He used this as a mere distraction and as Shifu cracked the boulder with an elegant move, Tai Lung punched his enemy through the Palace doors. Finally unleashing the wounded pride felt at his original "rejection", Tai Lung verbalized his contempt and anger for how his master did "nothing" when he was denied his "destiny". The red panda retorted that he merely obeyed his own master and that it wasn't his fault that his student wasn't the Dragon Warrior. This only angered Tai Lung further, as he kicked and threw several objects which the elder kung fu master blocked with ease. Now that Oogway was dead, Shifu and his failed student were the strongest masters of Kung fu and battled each other at even terms for most of the duel. However, with Shifu refusing to give the scroll, Tai Lung’s rage only fueled him. He then reached the alter of Oogway and studied his staff, well aware of his recent passing. For a brief moment, he regarded the memory of the one that denied him his “rightful” position as Dragon Warrior, seeing mostly an old tortoise that turned his father figure and proclaimed him unworthy of his right. Thus, he picked the staff up, knowing this would aggravate Shifu to become offensive rather than his mostly defensive style. After a short exchange, Tai Lung managed to catch Shifu mid-jump and began to strangle his former master with Oogway’s staff. Shifu’s continuous refusal of the scroll only angered Tai Lung to push harder. Eventually the staff broke, much to Shifu’s sadness. By this point, the elder Kung fu master began to feel the raw power of his younger opponent catch up with his age. Therefore, when he blocked a heavy kick from Tai Lung, Shifu realized it was only a matter of time. He tried to create some space between them and jumped from column to column, but was followed swiftly by the snow leopard. Tai Lung then caught Shifu and pushed him through the roof where they exchanged blows mid-air with lightning clashing above them. Shifu then held Tai Lung’s arm on his back and locked him as they descended down. However, Tai Lung used his other elbow to pummel Shifu’s face and grabbed him, making his foster father take the blow of falling through the roof. He then kicked Shifu into a column and ran towards him, paws caught with the blue flames of a nearby torch. By this point, Shifu had been severely beaten and exhausted much of his stamina. The fight reached its climax when Tai Lung began to brutally beat his tired master both physically and mentally. While the stressed master tried to desperately block and parry the ferocious hits of Tai Lung’s burning paws, he had to simultaneously endure hearing how his foster son only desired to make his foster father proud. The shouted accusations on top of demanding to be told how proud Shifu was of him as they fought, coupled with the fire attacks eventually becoming too fast and feral (overwhelmingly maiming him even further), and being savagely punched devastated him. Finally Tai Lung’s rage and attacks peaked, launching Shifu to the pool after a beastly strike.

  <p key="cdb6c9ac-e72c-4438-9649-f8230d98a7da">
   It was with the last disabling blow that Shifu finally cracked, telling Tai Lung he had always been proud of him, so much that his pride had blinded him to what Tai Lung was becoming and what he had unwittingly turned him into. Shifu offered a sincere and heartfelt apology and Tai Lung's gaze softened with hesitation, but he ultimately hardened his heart, proclaiming that he wasn't after an apology, he still wanted "his" scroll. Despite all of the hate, some small part of Tai Lung still cared for his master, however, his ambitious lust for power overcame what little compassion his heart still had. Looking up, he saw that the Dragon Scroll was missing. Furious, he smashed Shifu to the floor and began to tighten his grip around his neck. He almost killed Shifu, who told him he would never get the scroll but was interrupted by a shout from the entrance coming from an out-of-breath Po holding the Dragon Scroll, who claimed to be the Dragon Warrior.

   Incredulous, Tai Lung tossed Shifu aside, charging when Po challenged him to "come and get it". Tai Lung wasted no time and punched the Dragon Warrior away and grabbed the scroll. Much to his surprise, Po bounced back and redirected his power back. He then ran and catches the fleeing panda, kneeing him to the roof of the palace. Knocking him down the thousand steps, they fell and exchanged hits with Tai Lung hitting most of the steps and being subjugated to Po’s butt on top of his face. He fought Po for possession of the Dragon Scroll, only to be outsmarted and outdone at every turn in a series of game-like obstacles. For while he outmatched the fat warrior, though he was cut off-guard by all of the Dragon Warrior’s ingenuity. When the scroll landed on the top of the roof, Tai Lung became frightened as he saw how athletic Po was and his proximity to it. Strongly kicking the building, it began to collapse as he climbed after the Dragon Scroll, only to receive several roof tiles to his face. But Tai Lung gained the upper hand when he slammed Po into the ground with a mid-air kick and then used the falling momentum and all of his strength to make a burst of dust and rock, effectively creating a crater. Momentarily defeating and stunning Po long enough, allowed Tai Lung to grab the scroll and open it at long last—only to find that it was blank. As the panda coughed and struggled to his feet, Po explained to him that there was no special power in the scroll itself, or "secret ingredient"; "It's just you."

   Angered and unable to comprehend the scroll's lesson, Tai Lung tried to defeat Po once and for all. However, the chi-blocking punches and jabs only tickled Po in the process, due to his more unclear nerve pressures points. After being launched into the noodle shop after Po’s stomach absorbed and redirected it. Once the panda found new-found powers he was again bested in combat by the panda, though it should be mentioned that he fought more angrily and uncontrolled than usual, even biting his own tail. After being met with equal strength and skill, Tai Lung began to lose his mind as this fat, inexperienced panda was defeating him. Eventually, he fell from a great height, making a snow leopard-shaped hole in the crater. Making one last futile attempt to battle, a weakened Tai Lung was finally caught in the

   , the old master indicated Tai Lung was not the one, much to their shock. Expecting Shifu to speak for him on his behalf, he received an emotional blow when his master made no attempt to protest and Tai Lung saw this as an act of betrayal. It was this double rejection that revealed the darkness in Tai Lung's heart, expressed in pure rage as he attacked and ravaged the

However, though he was shown to be patronizing and brutal to anyone standing between him and the Dragon Scroll, it is possible he had no intent to hurt anyone as he was never shown to take a life (though he did came close to kill Shifu by strangling him). He was also revealed to have worked hard in everything he did to make Shifu proud and was shown to hesitant after hearing Shifu's sincere apology to him, though he hardened his heart as he still wanted the Dragon Scroll. Another example of his vulnerable side was also shown when Tai Lung expressed clear fear and desperation after finally being

   Overall, Tai Lung is a portrait of someone whose pride and ambitions went too far, driving him to violently lash out and try to take what was not his, harming anyone who stood in his way, including the very person whom he wanted to please in the first place. His eventual downfall came from his denial and his underestimation of Po, as well as his failure to accept that the secret to true power simply comes from within.

   If there is one word to describe Tai Lung's physical abilities, the word would be 'outstanding'. Every inch of Tai Lung's body is very well trained. This outstanding physical ability was shown when he was fighting the Furious Five, when he was able to use either only a single leg or a single arm to hang his whole body on the bridge. He also possesses incredible balance and agility, evinced in his casual attitude when battling Tigress atop the bridge, where the female Kung Fu master struggled to maintain her stance and had to readjust, while Tai Lung required no effort. Coupled with his speed, experience, skill, and exemplary physiology, the dreaded Snow Leopard managed to defeat a 1000 rhino soldiers, while quickly using his environment as an advantage.

He is also capable of defying gravity to an extent, shown when he sprinted and jumped up enormous stalactites while they were falling in mid-air, though this is likely due to his advanced physical speed and acute reflexes.

   with Shifu. He also displayed the ability to hold blue fire in his bare paws and use it when fighting, showing no visible signs of pain and demonstrating a high tolerance of it. One side of Tai Lung that is nearly unrivaled, is his extensive knowledge of kung fu and ruthless determination. No one could best him in skill alone, Po required the use of his environment and though he eventually bested him, the Snow Leopard did manage to pin the Dragon Warrior down first. Tai Lung's stamina is also noteworthy as he only went from battle to battle throughout the film and managed to run all the way from Chorh-Gom Prison to the Valley of Peace in a matter of days. Even after receiving multiple injuries and surviving a 200-meter fall, he still tried to fight. His pain tolerance is also seen when Po brings him to his knees with multiple blows from his stomach, sending him crashing through buildings and bouncing him high enough to leave a leopard-shaped hole in the ground. He is also seen using chi in some moves, such as his superkick, which he used on Po. This displays his limited skills at using Chi capabilities.

He also used his opponent's weapons to his advantage, as well as other unsuspecting objects nearby, such as rope, a

   , declaring Shifu could be the one to make him the Dragon Warrior now. The battle then became more vicious and Tai Lung yelled that he has done everything he'd done just to make Shifu proud, striking the red panda with blue-flamed fists until Shifu was beaten. Shifu then finally apologized, admitting that it was the pride and love for Tai Lung that had blinded him from seeing his flaws, and seeing what Tai Lung had been turning into. Tai Lung's fury melted away and he hesitated, momentarily at a loss, finally seeing that Shifu did still love him.

   Even so, Tai Lung ultimately hardened his heart and seized Shifu by the throat, growling he did not want an apology, but the Dragon Scroll, and he demanded the master to reveal its location. Choking in Tai Lung's grip, Shifu repeated that Tai Lung would never have the Dragon Scroll, and, furious, Tai Lung attempted to finish him off, but was interrupted by the arrival of

Enraged, he fought more seriously and eventually managed to get the scroll from Po, only to find that it was a blank, reflective surface with no secrets written on it. Even while down and injured, Po helpfully tried to explain the scroll's purpose, that the power was within oneself all along.

With the move performed, Tai Lung was defeated by the true Dragon Warrior: A panda he had laughed at upon first meeting.
