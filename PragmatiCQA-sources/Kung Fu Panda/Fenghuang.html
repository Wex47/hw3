   . Oogway had recognized special skills within Fenghuang, which he then refined in his mentoring sessions with her. As she trained, she gradually grew stronger and stronger until she was the most powerful of the Five. It was most likely this recognition that caused her heart to grow dark and change.
  </p>
  <p key="2f4a5ada-4cce-4221-acd8-db3224718e60">
   One day, Fenghuang approached Oogway and challenged him to a fight, believing that she deserved to be the new master of the Jade Palace. Oogway had anticipated this (having built an inescapable
   owl-shaped cage
   just for her), but he still had to fight and defeat her in order to get her inside it. After a long and fierce battle, Fenghuang found that she couldn't defeat Oogway. But before he could contain her, she flew away from the palace.
  </p>
  <p key="e79fb706-ff49-47e7-b590-42e1001ccb14">
   A rumor eventually sparked that she had made refuge in the
   Northern Mountains
   , too afraid of Oogway to return to the Jade Palace.

   . When Po inquired why they were afraid, Shifu took him to the archives and showed him a picture of the past Furious Five. Fenghuang was shown as one of them, but was crossed out, and Shifu explained to Po that she had become "twisted and dark", as all of the most powerful members of the Five had before her. During a talk with

   in order to protect his friends, who feared that he would become evil, and he traveled into the
   Northern Mountains
   . When he nearly fell to his death, Fenghuang unexpectedly appeared, grabbed him and carried him to her lair. She correctly guessed that he was from the

   , recognizing the scent of the sandalwood incense she disliked. Upon meeting her, Po asked the owl what it was like being evil. Curious, Fenghuang asked Po who told him she was evil, and mentioned

   . Po told her Oogway was gone, news which excited Fenghuang, who was convinced that with Oogway out of the way, nothing could stop her from conquering the Valley of Peace. She attempted to entice Po to join her, but the panda refused and they two briefly fought before Fenghuang took off and left Po in her lair, promising that he would eventually come around to her way of thinking.

   Returning to the Jade Palace, she first confronted Shifu (who at the moment held the same incense she disliked), and the two engaged in combat. Fenghuang's sharp and swift

   skills overwhelmed both Shifu and the Furious Five, and just as she had Shifu at her mercy, Po came crashing in on a hang-glider made out of Fenghuang's feathers, collected from her lair. As they fought, Fenghuang asked Po why would he fight for friends who had wanted him gone. Though this affected Po momentarily, he used the

  </p>
  <p key="ae6e9c50-a41c-43c1-b2e2-f3568c154e5c">
   Once again, Fenghuang tried to sway Po to her side, and offered to show him another of the

   This made Fenghuang's heart turn dark, believing that, as the strongest, she deserved to rule, leading to her corruption. As a result, Fenghuang became villainous and power-hungry. She also has a cowardly side, as she was too afraid to face Oogway a second time after he defeated her; she only returned for a second attempt at a takeover after learning that Oogway was dead, and she is a self-confessed cheater, not above making snarky comments to others.

It is only when Po makes it clear that he is siding with those she feels wronged her that she becomes actively antagonistic towards him.
