When his two lackies were quickly dealt with by the Five, the Wolf Boss lost his nerve. He fled the prison and boarded a cart pulled by an antelope.

However, Po returned alive, and freed his companions. The six warriors proceeded to battle the army of wolves and were soon joined by Masters Ox, Croc, and Shifu. The nine warriors worked together to use the front boats to block the harbor entrance before leaping in to defeat Shen's army once and for all. Realizing that Po and the other warriors were gaining victory, Shen snapped and ordered Boss Wolf to fire his cannon. When his subordinate refused to fire on his own warriors, Shen killed him and aimed the cannon at Po himself. Tigress shoved Po out the way just before the cannon blasted them all into the harbor.

   After that battle, Po boarded the remains of Shen's own ship to confront the peacock for the last time. A stunned Shen asked Po how he had found peace despite everything Shen had done to him. Po explained that he had let go of the past, and urged Shen to do the same. The peacock responded by pulling out his knives and attacking Po in one last attempt to kill him. Po and Shen fought, the peacock unknowingly slicing through the ropes holding up his destroyed cannon, which soon began to topple. Shen closed his eyes and was killed upon impact as Po was flung into the harbor. With the peacock's death, Shen's conquest came to an end.
