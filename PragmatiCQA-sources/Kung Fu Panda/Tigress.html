One night, Tigress escaped from the room and innocently approached the children in an attempt to play. However, her fangs and claws scared them off, and a rejected Tigress once again lost her temper. After being put in an isolated room, Tigress soon began to see herself as a monster, as everyone else did. Unsure of what could be done with the tiger cub, the caretakers summoned the aid of Master

   After meeting Tigress, the red panda firmly told her that she was not a monster, and introduced her to a game of dominoes, which required discipline to master. At first, Tigress couldn't place the dominoes correctly, often breaking the fragile wooden tiles in her grip, which frustrated her. But Shifu was a calm and patient teacher, and over time he instructed her to control her temper and her strength, teaching her the importance of discipline.

   On the day of the tournament, each of the Five publicly exhibited their talents one at a time, with Tigress performing last. Before she had the chance to start, Oogway sensed the presence of the Dragon Warrior, and it was time for the choosing. It appeared that Oogway was about to point at her — until a fat

   named

   Confused, Tigress asked if the old tortoise was pointing at her, but Oogway was convinced that Po had been chosen by the universe, and the panda's appearance was made not by accident, but as a sign. He proclaimed the panda as the Dragon Warrior — much to Tigress' and Shifu's horror, and as Po was carried off to the

  <p key="8f1fd4e4-5105-4c79-9b7b-8fff4603cbcc">
   Through the rest of the day, Shifu did his best to discourage Po and try to make him leave. He tried to intimidate him by showing him the

   and allowing the panda to be humiliated in front of the Five. The derision that Shifu felt was echoed by Tigress herself; she was offended that "a fat, flabby panda" like Po would be chosen over a loyal student like herself, and she made sure that Po knew her opinion of him—going as far as to scathingly tell him that night that he was a disgrace to

   leave the next morning, and he still wanted to learn kung fu. Attempts were made throughout the day to discourage Po and make him quit, but he persevered and made it through the second day—even after sparring with most of the Five and literally being thrown out by Shifu and tumbling down the steps of the palace. While most of the Five grew to be impressed at the panda's indefatigable tenacity, Tigress simply conceded that Po was there to stay, whether she liked it or not. While Po received acupuncture from Mantis and Viper, Tigress confided to Po the story of Tai Lung and Shifu's role in his life, while also hinting at her own past; that she had never received the same love that Shifu once showed for Tai Lung.
  </p>
  <p key="e65347fa-7787-4ed1-a2a2-95ee0fbaae78">
   Later on, Po began opening up more to the Five while preparing noodle soup for dinner which, to their delight, was among the most delicious dishes they've ever eaten—save for Tigress, who remained distant and ate tofu instead. The peaceful atmosphere was shattered, however, when Shifu arrived to bring them terrible news: Tai Lung had indeed

   , and to make things worse, Oogway had just passed away. Tigress begged her master to let the Five and herself stop Tai Lung, stating it was what he had trained them for. Surprisingly, Shifu said that it wasn't her or the others' destiny to defeat Tai Lung. He was now convinced that it was Po's job to stop Tai Lung after all, and nothing she could say would change his mind.
  </p>
  <p key="2dcf0cc9-779a-46c3-93ec-77352d5a51f7">
   However, Po had run away in fear of his upcoming challenge, and she secretly followed Shifu when he chased after him to bring him back. There she overheard Po admitting his own lack of confidence, seeing neither he nor her master had a solution on just how Po could possibly defeat Tai Lung. She decided to try to stop Tai Lung herself, immediately setting out on her own. To her surprise, she found that Viper, Mantis, Monkey, and Crane had followed her, and they stated that they wanted to help her in her endeavor.
  </p>

   Traveling as fast as they could, it took days to intercept Tai Lung at the

   ensued, which was made difficult by the rope bridge itself as well as Tai Lung's great strength and skill. For a short time she managed to stand her ground against him, though it didn’t last long. Tigress worked together with the others, displaying her greatest strength as a team leader/player, and she and her comrades managed to overpower the snow leopard once he got unbalanced in a stunning show of strength and cunning.
  </p>
  <p key="5fb68cbe-65a4-41e4-847e-a19df9aa9c2f">
   At first, they assumed that they had vanquished him completely, but sure enough, Tai Lung reappeared, swinging back from the opposite peak with the ropes from the now-destroyed bridge, and landing behind the startled team. Taking advantage of their unpreparedness, Tai Lung used a technique that Shifu hadn't taught them:
   chi blocking
   . Jabbing each of the Five in vital pressure points, he paralyzed them all—with the exception of Crane, whom he had left un-paralyzed, so he could carry the defeated warriors back to the Jade Palace as a warning; that he could defeat the strongest warriors in China.
  </p>
  <p key="a23d6d0c-322a-43e1-b352-a7f691eb35fe">
   It was with great shame that Tigress faced Po and Shifu when released from the effects of the chi block back at the Jade Palace, feeling that she had failed Shifu. He quietly rebuked her, telling her she could have been killed, but he added that Tai Lung's attempt to strike fear into their hearts wouldn't work: he had been busy training Po while the Five were absent, and he felt that the panda was now ready to receive the Dragon Scroll. Wasting no time, they all assembled in the Palace, where Shifu retrieved the scroll and proceeded to give it to Po. Upon opening it, Po relayed a most surprising bit of information: the legendary scroll, thought to endow the Dragon Warrior with unlimited power, was

   There was nothing else that could be done; Shifu ordered the Five and Po to evacuate the Valley in a last ditch effort, while he stayed behind to stall Tai Lung as long as possible. He expected to die during the battle, and his parting words to them were the ones that Tigress had always longed to hear from her master: that he was proud of them and that he was honored to be their master. The dismal feeling that everyone felt as they left had to be pushed aside once they started gathering the villagers. Tigress fell into her role as leader and began to lead the evacuation in spite of her sadness. After leading the populace to the surrounding mountains through the stormy night to morning, she and the Five were stunned as they witnessed a bright wave of light and energy coming from the middle of the town.

Tigress decides that the Garnet Palace is not where she belongs and asks Mugan to return to the Jade Palace, though Mugan imprisons her and claims she is Mugan's to train until she breaks. Fortunately, Po arrives to convince her to return to the Jade Palace and finds Tigress, who after listening to his attempts to convince her to return, explains that she has been imprisoned. Po breaks open the door and the two flee, only to be confronted by Mugan. Tigress tells Mugan there is more to life than kung fu and uncharacteristically performs an armpit fart as an example of this, of which Po finds humorous. Mugan attacks the pair, but they defeat her by trapping her in a fish tank. Tigress and Po leave, with Po trying to teach her how to burp speak, only for Tigress to politely refuse.

   On the last night of their journey, Tigress was awoken when Po had suffered a nightmare. Concerned, Tigress followed him outside and helped him relieve his frustrations by sparring with him; when he punched her outstretched hand, the impact echoed across the water but had failed to even faze her. Tigress told him about her harsh training exercises in her youth, and how her "hardcore" style allowed her to ignore pain. Po then shared with her how he had recently learned that Mr. Ping was his adoptive father (though this hardly surprised Tigress). When Po commented on his slight envy over Tigress' "hardcore" ability to ignore emotional pain, Tigress was taken aback. However, she didn't have time to say anything before arriving at Gongmen City.

   successfully picked the lock on Tigress' cuffs, allowing her to help free the others and destroy Shen's cannon. However, Tigress was surprised when she saw Po once again dazed by the pattern of Shen's feathered tail, thereby allowing the peacock to escape. Now under assault from the rest of Shen's cannons, she took matters into her own hands as she reached the bottom of the tower and quickly scouted the area outside, deftly defending herself and her friends from a hail of fire arrows from the wolves. Deducting an escape route, Tigress led the others to safety by scaling the outside of the falling tower and springing off it over the wall bordering the palace grounds.
  </p>
  <p key="e2c0640d-f67f-41f2-b1b9-45cb17084888">
   Returning to the jail to hide, she angrily confronted Po over why he let Shen escape, as well as almost getting them all killed in the bargain. When he refused to answer, she ordered him to stay in the company of Storming Ox and Croc, due to thinking that Po was not capable of completing the mission due to his unspoken hindrance. Po was adamant upon going with them however, leading the two to spar once more.
  </p>
  <p key="27b6cab6-43c0-46fe-9ce9-067570755888">
   Tigress had swiftly subdued Po and again demanded to know the truth. Po finally admitted how he remembered that Shen was present the night his biological parents abandoned him, and he needed Shen to tell him what happened despite all odds thrown against him while finally commenting that Tigress wouldn't understand due to her being too hardcore. Tigress lunged at Po, supposedly infuriated by his remark, but to the surprise of everyone else (especially Crane), she hugged him and told him that she did understand, demonstrating her softer side and how deep her friendship with Po had grown. Nevertheless, she softly and gently told Po to stay behind, as she didn't want to see him be killed. Such tenderness did not extend to her fellows, however, as she coldly told Crane to stop being a wimp when he asked if he could stay behind as well.

  <p key="4ea86841-5938-4c6d-826d-0c42cc623657">
   Tigress and the rest of the Five made their way over to

    Shen's refinery
   </a>
   where they intended to ignite powder kegs around the factory to destroy it. However, much to her shock, she saw that Po had disobeyed her and was confronting Shen alone. Fearing for Po's safety, she and the others quickly doused the fires to the powder kegs, and they began to make her way towards the two in order to protect Po, fending off Shen's elite soldiers along the way. She desperately tried to help her friend while fighting a gorilla warrior. Unable to reach him, she watched in horror while screaming as Po was blasted out of the factory and into the river by Shen's largest cannon. The Five were subsequently captured. Fearing that the worst had happened to Po, Tigress felt she had failed him.

   . Shen mocked them for their sadness over the "death" of Po and bragged about how he would kill them and their "precious kung fu" upon reaching the harbor; Tigress snarled back, but was unable to resist in any way. Monkey was the only one of the chained Five that seemed to retain any fighting spirit and looked to Tigress for support, but she merely responded with a defeated expression at the mention of Po's name and began to subtly mourn him. She was further disgusted by Shen's lack of concern for the well-being of the bystanders witnessing the event by blasting away a bridge to clear a path, which led her to call him a coward.
  </p>
  <p key="4f524209-b9bd-4652-a021-17163529e7c1">
   She was perhaps the most astonished when Po revealed himself to be alive and rescued her and the rest of the Five. She and the others managed to fight their way along Shen's fleet with the assistance of Croc and Ox, who were freed and accompanied by Shifu. The nine kung fu masters proceeded to destroy much of the fleet, blocking the way to the harbor with their own boats. Shen aimed his cannon at Po, only for Tigress to push him aside just as it fired, saving Po's life but taking most of the blast in the process.
  </p>
  <p key="a2fc7b77-ca85-48fc-bddc-e2280e3fdfac">
   Wounded and floating on a piece of driftwood, Po waded towards her and gripped her limp paw. She feebly lifted her head, but was too weakened to say anything. Tigress then watched helplessly as Po stood upon the wreckage of an overturned boat, trying to reach out for her friend but was still too frail to do anything. Therefore, she could merely spectate, as Po was facing the remaining cannon-armed fleet on his own. As the first shot was fired, she, along with every other witness, was astounded when Po deflected the projectile and every other one that Shen fired to the point of even going as far as to knock some back at the fleet. After the flagship's destruction, she witnessed Po's final battle with Shen, and the lord's defeat at the hands of his own work.
  </p>
  <p key="a2aa16a6-d38b-4d9e-b50f-47b1914164e4">
   After the battle, she helped Po out of the water and onto a dock, commenting his work as "pretty hardcore." She was surprised once more when Po hugged her in a manner similar to how she did in the prison—so much so that she didn't have time to react before he was enthusiastically greeted by the rest of the Five. Her unexpected hug left her momentarily stunned. Along with the rest of Gongmen City, she watched as the burning remains of Shen's flagship set off a fireworks display.

   to order food. After traveling to the Training Hall, she and the other members of the Furious Five are noticeably shocked when Shifu announces that he will be teaching his last class, and even more startled when Shifu states that training will now be in the hands of the Dragon Warrior. Po wondered why Tigress shouldn't teach because "She's always telling everyone what to do" to which she snapped back at him "Be quiet, Po!" During training, Po's inability to teach causes Tigress — along with the other members of the Furious Five — to be injured, with Tigress specifically being set on fire and her butt pierced by a fiery arrow.

   Tigress is later present with Shifu, Viper, and Monkey as they read messages which tell of Kai having absorbed the chi of every single kung fu master in China, save the Jade Palace masters. Soon after, Kai shows up with an enslaved Crane and Mantis and declares his intentions to destroy everything Oogway had built. Tigress is the most vocal in her aggression towards Kai compared to Viper and Monkey, claiming Kai is "not fit to speak [Oogway's] name." Kai, in turn, mocks Tigress by calling her a "little kitten". Tigress manages to land a large kick on Kai, sending a massive wave of chi over the vicinity, which stuns Kai for a few seconds. Proud of herself, she asks Kai "How's that for a little kitten?" Despite putting up a considerable fight, the masters are outmatched, mostly because they are fighting their own members and Shifu who seems to be gaining the edge over Kai, is thrown off by Kai’s Oogway medallion and is hit against Oogway's statue. Tigress is the most concerned and quickly comes to Shifu's aid but is unable to prevent Monkey and Viper from being taken by Kai. As the last remaining member of the Furious Five, Tigress lunges forward to fight but is held back by Shifu who insists she must warn Po. Tigress appears reluctant to leave Shifu, but is thrown aside by Kai's jade swords. Ultimately, she's helpless to do anything but watch as Kai destroys the Jade Palace and absorbs the chi of her master. Managing to recover one scroll, she sets off for the panda village. Upon arriving in the panda village, a distraught and somewhat hurt Tigress warns Po of the transpiring events, and that Kai will be targeting the panda village next, so she gets to the panda village sparking fear in everyone there. Afterward finding out the news from Tigress of Kai's success, Po decides he is to train on his own.

  </p>
  <p key="0dcac782-9666-476b-a2c6-3d7356f13ded">
   Afterward, she assists Po in training of the pandas, but is very confused, as his teaching method is encouraging them to do their everyday activities as their training.

   Tigress is also not without insecurities as a result of years of training under the initially stern and mostly withdrawn Shifu, whom she calls the closest thing to a father she has ever had. Consequentially, both Kung Fu and her master's approval form a very large part of Tigress' self worth, which both the films and series occasionally imply she struggles with. In the first film, as she recalls in a flashback how Shifu has never loved anyone like he loved Tai Lung, young Tigress lands a strong blow on the training doll, only to have her posture silently corrected by a glaring Shifu. As she looks after him sadly, the scene fades into the now adult Tigress, still baring the same sad look for a moment before covering it up with her usual severity. Also, in The Spirit Orbs of Master Ding, Tigress is unable to cope with the idea that Po is becoming better than her in every way that is important to her, since she does not know how to do much else besides kung fu. After Shifu complements Po, Tigress' jealousy finally gets the better of her and causes her to act recklessly, becoming the catalyst for the events of the episode.

   Before Po's arrival, Tigress was the only member of the Furious Five who was completely serious and stoic, although her humorlessness in the first film could also be attributed to her anger at Po for accidentally crushing her dream. However, after Po is accepted by, and begins to really integrate with the Five, his general levity seems to cause Tigress to lighten up and become more playful. In the credits of the first film, she is seen toying affectionately with the panda training doll, similar to a cat with a ball of wool, in between savaging it. She is also seen copying Po's imitation of Shifu, this time to her master's face, who seems to enjoy her impression immensely. In the TV series, though still retaining her characteristically serious attitude, she often shown to have a dry and sarcastic sense of humor, and often appreciates, and very occasionally participates in, the jokes and pranks that Po and the Five play on each other. A recurring joke is her making a comment that the others take for a joke, only to ask what they mean when they comment on it. For example, when observing Shifu practicing his deathly dull speech for the Moon Festival, Tigress remarks that she will start practicing sleeping with her eye open and is clueless when Monkey laughs.

   Due to her physiology, she naturally possessed immense strength, even as a child. This has been enhanced through years of rigorous training. She also continues to build her strength, possessing enough at one point to be able to catch and hold Po in midair with ease, despite the panda's weight. She is also extremely quick like a cheetah, can crawl, lead and do acrobatics like any feline as well. These traits have also been enhanced over the years of rigorous training. She strikes directly without hesitation, utilizing her extraordinary physical powers to shatter opponents' defenses. An example of her strength and power would be the fact that she managed to break through Kai's defenses and momentarily stun him, with him being a being of supernatural durability, powered by chi. Such a feat was not accomplished by anyone, except Po and Oogway. Like the traditional tiger fighter, Tigress stays close to the ground; she is agile, acrobatic and elegant.

   , Tigress' friendship with the panda gradually grew. While Po's immaturity, clumsiness and habit for hasty decisions is still very much an irritant, she has come to realize that he is a resourceful warrior who truly deserves to be the Dragon Warrior. In turn, her dedication to emotional control has been challenged in the series, and her personality and way of doing things has tended to clash with Po's. Furthermore, though Po frequently attempts to develop his friendship with Tigress throughout the series, she has a tendency to be verbally insensitive and occasionally even hurtful towards him due to her innate bluntness. When becoming frustrated with Po's bumbling through their mission, Tigress angrily threw his ineptitude in his face and implied Master Oogway had made a mistake in choosing him as the Dragon Warrior. She regretted these words when Po, very hurt by her remarks, told her as seriously as he could that whilst she is a great warrior, she is an awful friend. On another occasion, Po showed Tigress a spoon he carved for his dad as a Winter Festival gift. Tigress, however, did not understand the sentiment behind it and disparagingly pointed out how bad a present the poorly-made spoon was since Po always makes such a big deal of the Winter Festival. This causes Po to become insecure about his gift and take a bounty hunting job to earn the money for a "proper" gift, triggering the episode's events.

   The idea of there being some kind of potential romance between the two has been explored for comedic effect throughout the series. In "Midnight Stranger", Tigress becomes enamored of the Midnight Stranger, and begins to act in an awkward, uncharacteristically love-struck manner, much to the delight of Po, who is actually the Midnight Stranger, and who becomes desperate to tell Tigress the truth. However, eventually Tigress discovers Po's secret and, realizing she had been fantasizing about Po all along, is utterly horrified and has to leave to throw up. Furthermore, in "Bride of Po", Tigress is skeptical and suspicious of Po's new fiancée, and whilst her suspicion proves to be correct, Po continues to misinterpret them as romantic jealousy, to the point where Tigress gets so annoyed she resorts to physical violence.

   Though she demonstrated her strict nature by ordering (and eventually fighting) Po to stay behind in the prison for refusing to explain his sudden hesitation in catching Shen, she also showed compassion towards him at Po's revelation of his parentage, surprising him and the rest of the Five when she hugged him instead of lunging at him, and saying she

Later, when she and the other Five found Po in Shen's fireworks factory, Tigress went after Po to prevent him from being hurt, but was too late as Shen blasted Po from the building with a cannon.

   Near the end of the film, after Shen was defeated, Po hugged Tigress after she complimented his heroic actions as "pretty hardcore". Tigress was shocked and did not react, but she watched the fireworks with Po and others with a smile on her face, showing that she wasn't angered by Po's attempt to come emotionally close to her.

   In the third film Tigress retains her good-natured relationship with Po, though like the other Five she proves skeptical of his teaching ability, particularly after a fairly disastrous training session. She is also quick to try and dissuade him from facing Kai without mastering the power of Chi, and agrees with him when he expresses to his fellow pandas his belief that he can't teach. Tigress is also confused by Po's methods when he does begin training the pandas, but eventually sees the positive results of his tactics. She is quick to join with the pandas and Mr. Ping to reach out with their Chi to Po in the Spirit Realm, and remains concerned for him when the masters Kai had previously captured re-materialize but Po is absent. She and the others are overjoyed upon his return, and later accept instruction from him in the art of giving Chi.

   Her title is well deserved, though, amongst the Five, as she constantly displays quick reflexes and a mind that can hatch plans and fighting tactics which get her and her team out of impossibly dangerous situations. Tigress was also the impetus behind the group forming in the first place; though it was due to a series of misunderstanding, she quickly came to appreciate and admire their various skills and abilities.

She played with the toy frequently and when she met the real Tigress she instantly ran to hug her.

When Kai and his jade zombies came, she protected Lei Lei from them and held her to protect her from Kai. At the end of the movie, she was seen holding Lei Lei up as everyone was practicing Kung Fu.

   Yijiro first appeared in Legends of Awesomeness when his arch nemesis, Kira Kozu was terrorizing China by building his own army. Tigress seemed to have a very strong crush on Yijiro, but did what she could to hide it from the rest of her teammates. However, when she first got a look of his fighting style, Viper noticed Tigress blushing. Later on, when Yijiro gave her a headband that bared a Japanese symbol for "brave warrior", Crane noticed her having a romantic daydream, which she tried to hide from him.

   The Midnight Stranger first appeared in Legends of Awesomeness while crime in the town was at an all time high; he would appear in the night to protect the town and fight evil. While the Furious Five had their questionable opinions on the Midnight Stranger except Po, Tigress is shown to have strong feelings in the belief that the Midnight Stranger would find his true love, by referring herself. As everyone gazes at her silently, she notices them in surprise and leaves the room embarrassed, saying she's "gonna go work out". Later she was discovered by Po, where she leans against a wall lustfully as she explains how "if the Midnight Stranger was around that he maybe needed her help", Po then notices her perfume in surprise saying "Are you wearing perfume?!" as she denies the fact until she then confesses her intentions. She then once again withdraws, stating she's "going to work out". Later that night, Tigress is excited to finally meet the Midnight Stranger until she discovers the truth and that the Midnight Stranger is actually Po in disguise. In her shock, she states how disgusting this is as a way to hide her embarrassment from her previous romantic displays. With the Furious Five expecting her to head off to "work out" again, she corrects by throwing up while walking away.
