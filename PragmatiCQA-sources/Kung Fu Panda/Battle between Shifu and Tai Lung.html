Tai Lung greeted his former master, but Shifu coolly made it clear that the snow leopard was no longer welcome at the palace.

Tai Lung then sent a large piece of the entrance steps flying at Shifu, which he broke apart in a flash of green light. While Shifu was distracted, Tai Lung gave him a punch that sent him flying back into the

   , Shifu had done nothing to defend him. When Shifu insisted that Tai Lung not being chosen wasn't his fault and remained on the defensive, Tai Lung began flinging weapon after weapon at him, continuing to scream accusations that it was

   Momentarily distracted at the sight of his master's staff destroyed, Shifu barely had time to resist a sucker-kick from Tai Lung, who then pursued the old master as they jumped from pillar to pillar. They eventually burst through the roof, and as they battled in mid-air, Shifu gained the upper hand for a moment, but then Tai Lung grabbed his neck and Shifu took the worst of the impact as they crashed back through the roof. Tai Lung then kicked him into a pillar while he himself knocked into a lantern, setting part of the floor alight in blue flames.

   Holding some of the fire in his paws, Tai Lung attacked Shifu once more and demanded to be told how proud Shifu was of him as he fought his former master, his constant punches having the affect of a battering ram against Shifu, weakening his defense and not allowing the red panda the chance to so much as block his attacks. With a double-fisted punch, he gave Shifu a powerful blow, sending him flying onto the steps in front of the

   proud, in fact, that his pride blinded him to what Tai Lung was becoming before it was too late. Shifu offered a sincere and heartfelt apology, hoping that Tai Lung would stop his quest for the ultimate power that wasn't his to start with and redeem himself. Tai Lung hesitated, seeing that Shifu did still love him and was proud of what he had been, but refusing to accept defeat and the reality that he may

   He grabbed Shifu by the throat and lifted him into the air, declaring that he didn't want his apology—he still wanted "his" scroll. Looking up, he saw that the Dragon Scroll was missing. Furious, he slammed Shifu into the floor and demanded the scroll's location. While gasping for breath, Shifu told him that the Dragon Warrior would have taken the scroll halfway across China by now, and that Tai Lung would never get the scroll, but at that point began to pass out. Enraged, Tai Lung prepared his

   While his army attacked the village, Tai Lung confronted Shifu inside the Hall of Warriors. After exchanging words as they did in the film, Tai Lung insisted that there need not be a battle if Shifu just gave him the Dragon Scroll. When his old teacher refused, Tai Lung punched him across the room, only to see that the Scroll was no longer in the dragon statue's mouth. Shifu declared that the scroll was safe from Tai Lung, and the snow leopard ordered his minions to tear the palace apart in search of it.

   Shifu fiercely defended the kung fu artefacts from the wolf soldiers while Tai Lung searched the palace. Coming up empty handed, Tai Lung smashed his way back into the Hall of Warriors through the ceiling just as Shifu defeated the last of the wolves and demanded that he tell him where it is. Shifu's refusal enraged the snow leopard, who assaulted Shifu with chunks of rock thrown front the pile of rubble he was standing on. Shifu responded by sending the large pieces of rubble back at him, and Tai Lung retreated back through the ceiling into the upper level of the palace.

  <p key="0c466d52-2427-48ac-a52a-23798d2e8ee9">
   Shifu followed in pursuit as Tai Lung unleashed his anger being held in prison for twenty years, but the red panda still would not give him what he felt he deserved. Tai Lung summoned more wolf soldiers to destroy Shifu, but he fended them off while Tai Lung attacked with thrown rubble and pillars. After Shifu sent the pillars right back at Tai Lung, weakening him significantly. Tai Lung retreated to the top level of the palace with the red panda in pursuit. Standing on a ruined balcony, Tai Lung insisted that everything he had done, he had done to make Shifu proud, and demanded to know how proud Shifu was before attacking more rubble. Dodging the projectiles, Shifu made his way across the broken floor and wooden beams, and when he got close Tai Lung swung at him with a large pillar. Shifu dodged the pillar, used it as a bridge to cross the gap between them, and engaged Tai Lung in a final skirmish that ended with him knocking him former student to the floor.

   With Tai Lung seemingly defeated, Shifu admitted but he was indeed proud of Tai Lung, and it was that pride that blinded him that what his student was becoming. Shifu apologised and turned away, but Tai Lung did not want his pity, and for the last time demanded the location of the Scroll. Shifu informed him that the Scroll was far away in the

   Dragon Warrior's hands. Livid, Tai Lung lunged at Shifu, the resulting fight bringing them back down to the Hall of Warriors where he kicked his old teacher through the doors of the palace, defeating him. Tai Lung then pinned Shifu to the ground and once again demanded the Scroll, but Shifu informed him that it was likely halfway across China by now, and will never be Tai Lung's. With that, Tai Lung prepared to deal the final blow, only to be interrupted by the arrival of the real Dragon Warrior, Po, possessing the Dragon Scroll.
