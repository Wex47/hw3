   . It is assumed that as Mr. Ping grew older, he eventually received the "Noodle Dream" and told his father about it, who then knew it was time to tell him the "secret ingredient" of the noodle soup and have him take over the shop. Eventually, Mr. Ping inherited the noodle shop from his father.

But after hearing the child cry, he decided to keep the child until someone came looking for him. Quickly finding out that the infant was too big and heavy for him to carry, he led him inside his shop with a trail of dumplings. He bathed him, fed him, nurtured him, and grew to love him until he came to realize that no one was coming for the child. He then made a life-altering decision: to raise the child as his own son. Mr. Ping then named the baby panda "Xiao
   Po" (小宝
   ).

   Since then, Mr. Ping had raised Po in the noodle shop, teaching him all he knew as a noodle-maker and hoping that one day, his adopted son would take over the restaurant just as he did from his own father. It never bothered him when Po broke a plate or messed up an order, because to him, his son was a hero.

Mr. Ping returns from his journey, laughing about Shifu being poisoned by "some idiot cook", oblivious to the fact his son was the one who did so. He is proud of Po being the chef despite of the mess he had made, and dismisses Po's notions about taking a different career. He makes him take out the trash, causing Tigress to switch the scroll with the names of warriors with the scroll that had Po's other career options.

   One morning, Po was late getting up for work and made a series of noises in his room. When he finally came downstairs, Mr. Ping asked his son as to what was happening. Po claimed that he was having a dream about noodles. This excited Mr. Ping, believing that Po finally had the "Noodle Dream", a clear sign that he would eventually take over the restaurant. Po unenthusiastically put it down as "no big deal" and asked his father if he ever wanted to do anything else besides make noodles. Mr. Ping admitted that when he was "young and crazy", he dreamed of running away to make tofu, but gave up on it because it was a "stupid dream".

Knowing that everyone in the Valley would be there, he gave Po the noodle cart. But some time later, Mr. Ping discovered that Po had abandoned the noodle cart at the bottom of the stairs and found him seated in a chair with lit fireworks tied to it. He attempted to stop his son from performing such a dangerous stunt, but Po insisted that he wanted to see the Dragon Warrior. Mr. Ping was confused and reminded him that he just had the Noodle Dream, but Po confessed that he lied. As the rockets were about to ignite, Po exclaimed, "I love

   ", Mr. Ping tells of how he was a little boy and went to Xin Xau forest against his parents's wishes. He got lost and encountered a creature known as the Qilin, then escaped. Since that day, no one believed him. He soon takes Po to the forest to find the creature and bring it back to the village. Soon, Po doesn't believe his father and no one wants to eat at the Noodle Shop. By the time Po believes him, Ping refuses to accept Po's story, until he saves both his son and the Qilin from General Tsin. The duo then use the Qilin to get back Mr. Ping's customers.

After a while of waiting for someone to come, he eventually decided on two things: to make his soup without radishes, and to take him in as a son, commenting on how "both [his] soup and [his] life had been that much sweeter." However, Po was unsatisfied, wondering how he could've ended up in that box. Mr. Ping reminds him that though his story may not have such a happy beginning, he is currently living out a happy life now.

Still feeling that sense of worry that this might be an adventure his son may never return from, he tried pleading Po not to leave, but Po insisted that he discover where he came from and fulfill his duty as the Dragon warrior. As Po takes his traveling pack, Tigress assures Mr. Ping that Po will return, and Mr. Ping stood in the middle of the village road and sadly watched as Po and the Five departed.

Mr. Ping politely apologized as he told them Po wasn't present because of the mission that he and the Furious Five were given to save Gongmen City and China, but the pig's son is still not happy. The mother unwillingly suggested they returned some other time to see him, but a worried Mr. Ping, terrified and upset for the well-being of his only son, finally broke down in tears and answered that he doesn't know if Po will be returning or not. But just a moment later, Po appeared at the shop's entrance with a crate of radishes under each arm, much to the delight of Mr. Ping and the customers. He then asked him if he saved China, to which Po confirmed and additionally added how he also discovered where he came from.

But Mr. Ping insisted on cooking and he happily walked into the kitchen with his son.

After Po accidentally added szechuan peppercorn to the bath instead of bath salts, Po confided in Mr. Ping regarding his insecurities about becoming a teacher and whether it defined him as the Dragon Warrior.

Po then introduced Li to Mr. Ping, who happily hugged him, thanking him for taking care of his son. Getting jealous, Mr. Ping tries to dispute if Li is actually Po's biological father, but the pandas were too busy learning to "belly gong". Mr. Ping soon interposed himself in a painting that included Li and Po and pointed out that Po was suppose to be the only panda left. Li reveals that there is more in a secret village of pandas in the mountains and that was received by a message of the universe that led him to the Valley, which the crowd was quick to accept.

Not wanting his son to leave again, Mr. Ping pleaded with the others to open another scroll and find another solution. However, as Shifu supported Li's offer, Po reasoned that joining Li could help stop Kai and help him rediscover what it was to be a panda.

   Afraid that Li was going to steal Po from him, Mr. Ping secretly stowed away in Po's backpack. When he was discovered midway through their journey, Mr. Ping claimed he followed to ensure that Po wouldn't go hungry in case the pandas don't have food he likes. Li tries to politely decline his company, stating that the pandas can't share the village's location with outsiders, but Mr. Ping insisted he was trustworthy, recalling how he raised Po for twenty years before telling him he was adopted. That seemed to satisfy Li, who remarked it would be mean to make him fly back; Po hadn't realize his adoptive father could fly before Mr. Ping reminded he was a bird after all.

Subsequently, the dinner was entertained by

   As night fell, the festivities are interrupted by the arrival of Tigress, who informed everyone that Kai attacked the Valley and had taken the chi of every master in China. Mr. Ping panicked, asking the status of his restaurant, to which everyone looked at him in awkward silence. Worse of all, Li confesses to Po that he lied to him about knowing the secret of chi, believing he was saving Po from Kai. Though Mr. Ping pleaded with his son to flee, Po was determined to stay, and began training himself to fight Kai.

   Worried, Ping visited Li in his hut with dumplings and tells him that was not the only one lying to Po and was worried that Li remove Po from his life. However, now he realizes that it's not wrong for Po to have two loving fathers in his life. However, Li believed he had irreparably shattered the bond he had with Po for lying to him, but Mr. Ping assured him that Po would find it in his heart to forgive him as Po forgave Mr. Ping for lying about him being adopted. Handing Li the painting they made back in the Valley, he reminded that Po was confused and that to save the world, he needed the support of both his fathers to succeed.

   Mr. Ping and Li soon rallied the pandas to help Po fight Kai, but Po was least convinced of their fighting skills.

He also said that Po would surely forgive him, as Mr. Ping had also hid the truth from Po for twenty years about being his father and Po managed to forgive him.
