   After the fight, the warriors were given a single coin for their three-way-tie, which led to an argument between the three that nearly ended in another battle. Fortunately, Oogway soon appeared before they started fighting. After revealing his identity to the warriors, Oogway gave them the offer to journey to

Seeing an opportunity to gain immense fortune, Croc finally agreed along with Ox and Rhino.

   And so the three set off with Oogway towards the fortress, passing through various obstacles as they went. During the journey, Ox attempted to bargain with Oogway to dump the other two warriors and split the profits themselves. However, Croc and Rhino were doing the same thing, but Oogway ignored their offers. While surrounding a campfire one night, Ox made clear his selfish plans to spend his days counting the money he apparently will earn after completing the quest. After listening to the trio and learning of their respective desires, Oogway gave them some cryptic advice; that when the path one takes always leads back to themselves, they will never get anywhere unless they "change course". Before they could settle for the night, Oogway received news that the Wu Sisters were plotting to unify the gang leaders, and the group set out in order to reach the fortress as soon as possible.
  </p>
  <p key="fa0f4d43-f462-41df-a3fe-28862fcb6999">
   To encourage them to change their ways, Oogway secretly led the trio into an extremely dangerous path called the
   <a href="Bridge of Mists.html" key="a702b6e1-a802-47f4-8e12-2b10efc1ed68" title="Bridge of Mists">
    Bridge of Mists
   </a>
   . When the three inquired as to how they would get across, Oogway replied by flinging all three of them into the bridge, forcing them to prop themselves between the two pillars. Oogway then taught them all an important lesson about cooperation, by having crossing the makeshift bridge the three made up, pulling up Rhino as he did so, and then having them all make it across the bridge to the other side, pulling each other up as they went.
  </p>
  <p key="cc09f84b-227f-4ac2-a68f-d51fa4429d39">
   Later during the day, the trio and Oogway were climbing up the side of Wu Fortress, where they finally learned that Oogway was being metaphorical about his promised riches. Rhino's protests accidentally got them trapped on a river of lava when his heavy footsteps caused the ledge they were standing on to break away. Oogway managed to get them to safe ground, but fell to his apparent death, leaving them with only the advice "Remember the path" to guide them now.
  </p>
  <p key="be5e9aee-1165-4c1d-a4a7-33d4f0f60646">
   Dispirited at their loss, the trio tried to find their way home. However, they encountered a village devastated by the Wu sisters' forces, where its citizens desperately attempted to hire them for protection. Moved by the villagers' plight, the trio declined the fee and resolved to stop the Wu sisters for the sake of a higher ideal.
  </p>
  <p key="3989154f-e0cb-460b-98df-43f32fa50d32">
   Thus motivated, the trio interrupted the sisters' summit. When the former street-fighters revealed that they were doing this for honor, they intimidated the various visiting gangs into retreating while the sisters fought alone. Although the sisters proved too much to fight alone, as Ox discovered when he was sent flying after being hit by the vortex, Rhino, Ox and Croc managed to combine their talents to defeat them in a coordinated attack. After Ox deduced that the tail knot at the center of the vortex was their weakness, Croc charged at the vortex and brought it to a halt with his tough hide. Croc was able to position the vortex enough for Rhino to charge through the knot and break the sisters apart. The trio then worked together to defeat the separated sisters, eventually trapping them beneath a large statue head.
  </p>
  <p key="9d9a5175-feae-47b4-90bc-b969077b04bb">
   At the moment of their victory, Oogway reappeared, having captured the rest of the gangs, and praised Rhino, Ox, and Croc for being worthy warriors who had found a higher purpose to fight.
  </p>
  <p key="9266f4e8-2060-4a02-8c47-ed227651195b">
   According to Po, after these events Oogway set Ox and his fellow warriors on a journey which eventually led them to Gongmen City where they formed the Masters Council.

   . Master Ox had been trying to save crops after a storm flooded the field, when a group of rat bandits attacked him during his lunch break. He fought back using his strength and skill, but the bandits grew in number, and then formed a huge army, latching arms so as not to sink into the mire. This tactic impressed Master Ox, and he welcomed the challenge, fighting both the two-hundred bandits and the rice fields drowning him. Before becoming overwhelmed, he unleashed a great display of his brawn and forced the rats away with his powerful horns. He continued to fight off the bandits, and then revealed his own cunning by using the length of his horns and his speed as leverage to keep from sinking. He charged, sending the rats flying off into the skies. With the fight over, Master Ox noticed the time and saw his lunch break was over, and continued his work in the fields. The battle became known as the "most epically awesome of lunch breaks of all time".

However, Shen was able to defeat both of them before turning his attentions to Thundering Rhino. The more powerful

   broke into the jail in an attempt to free the two masters and enlist their aid in defeating Shen. However, neither Ox nor Croc was willing to leave their cell, as they are convinced that resistance against Shen is futile. Because of this belief, no amount of arguing or fighting (courtesy of Po trying to force them out of their cell) was able to change their minds. Ox once more showed his impressive strength by breaking a bar of the cell, and then forcing the sides of it deep into the wall. Also, when the cell door was destroyed during the struggle, Ox and Croc simply walked into the opposite cell and locked themselves in there. Before Po and the Five could convince Ox and Croc to leave, Boss Wolf and his soldiers came in and discovered the Kung Fu masters, forcing them to leave Ox and Croc behind.

   . Storming Ox and Croc had been alerted to the sound of hundreds of wolves making their way through the city and demanded what Po and the Five had done. They were ultimately ignored while Tigress confronted Po over his letting Shen escape. Storming Ox and Croc witnessed Po refusing to answer as well as Tigress deciding to leave him in the jail, and the brief fight that followed. Po eventually revealed his reasons for wanting to pursue Shen, and though empathetic, Tigress decided that he remain behind anyway. The Five left Po behind in the jail while entrusting his safety to the two masters. Storming Ox and Croc attempted to reassure Po, but it was no use as the panda followed the Five anyway.

All nine warriors put up an enormous fight, but were ultimately blasted into the harbor by Shen's cannon. All but Po were too badly injured to fight from that point on. Ox was among the many who witnessed Po use

   Storming Ox's relationship with Thundering Rhino was initially one of competition, the two first meeting-so far as is known-while taking part in a street fight and then being recruited by Master Oogway for a mission in which each tried to convince the aged master to cut the other two youths in the group out of the rewards they believed were to be theirs. In the end, however, the trio were awakened to a sense of honor and worked against the Wu Sisters, defeating them and saving China. Storming Ox soon became Rhino's pupil and colleague on the Kung Fu Council, and was fiercely protective of his friend and mentor. Witnessing the death of Thundering Rhino left Storming Ox in a profound depression for some time, even up to the point that he proclaimed "Kung fu is dead!"

   Storming Ox and Master Croc are old friends and colleagues, though it wasn't always so. The pair were once rivals to each other and Thundering Rhino, as seen by their competing in a street fight and later for Oogway's favor during their mission against the Wu Sisters. However, witnessing the havoc caused by the sisters and their allies persuaded the young masters to fight for a more noble cause, and they soon came to respect each other as allies. Ox and Croc fought well as a team, though sadly they found themselves companions in despair after the death of their friend Thundering Rhino.

   Storming Ox initially had little respect for Master Oogway, and prior to meeting him was-like Croc-unfamiliar with the esteemed master, unlike their reluctant ally Thundering Rhino. It took some time for his opinion to change, as Oogway's selfless views and unorthodox methods threw Ox and his companions for a loop. However, they eventually came to recognize the wisdom concealed behind the Tortoise's eccentricity, and his attitude helped pave the way for their change of heart in fighting the evil Wu Sisters.

   The first time that Storming Ox met Po was when the Dragon Warrior and the Furious Five found him and Master Croc in Gongmen Jail. Disheartened, hopeless, and fearing that resistance would bring Shen's wrath upon the citizens of Gongmen, Ox turned a deaf ear to Po's pleas that he and Croc join the fight. He tried to dissuade them from their course, and later became enraged when the results of their failure to stop Shen became evident to him from within his cell. Fortunately, Master Ox soon found himself fighting alongside Po thanks to Shifu's efforts with him and Croc.

   Master Ox initially regarded Shen as a disrespectful fool for daring to challenge the Masters' Council, though he soon learned that Shen was more formidable a fighter than he appeared. However, the true shock came when Shen unleashed his deadly weapon, slaying Ox's beloved mentor and friend Thundering Rhino. For a time, Ox came to regard Shen as a threat that he could not stop, though he still believed that his evil had to be halted by some means. He was eventually convinced to rejoin the fight against Shen himself, and fought against his army in the battle for Gongmen City.

    Storming Ox was one of the challenging characters to model and animate due to him being a naturally non-upright-walking animal. Modeling supervisor Jason Turner explains that "characters with a heavy upper body and torso have a lot of mass to resolve when their legs come up or they have to sit down. [They] don't stand upright in nature because they aren't equipped with the correct anatomy to do so. Modeling them for our film required intense thinking and testing to find the right balance in their build."
