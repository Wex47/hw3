   Physically, Tai Lung was stronger, faster and more agile, however, by using all of his own trials and tribulations, Po kept the kung fu prodigy at bay. Despite Po's ongoing success, Tai Lung manages to get a strong kick crashing the Dragon Warrior into the ground and then fell down on him with enough force and momentum to leave a crater. A defeated and momentarily stunned Po watched Tai Lung get a hold of the scroll and open it, only to be shocked that it was blank. Po reveals to Tai Lung the meaning behind the scroll, that in just believing you are special is enough. Infuriated, Tai Lung throws down the Dragon Scroll and uses his deadly nerve attack on Po, but it doesn't work on Po due to his girth.

   When the Furious Five and villagers return to see that Po defeated Tai Lung, they cheer and bow to him, accepting him as the Dragon Warrior. Po was modestly pleased, but quickly remembered that Shifu was hurt back at the palace. He rushed back and found Shifu still injured, and told him he had defeated Tai Lung.

But soon enough, he became overwhelmed by the many tasks of preparing for the Feast, and was burdened further by not being able to have his father come to the event.

   , in hopes that the two of them could spend the holiday together. However, Mr. Ping refused, stating he couldn't be away from the restaurant and let his customers down. After Po told him he couldn't be home during the holiday, Mr. Ping grudgingly told him to to the palace feast, resulting in Po feeling guilty.

  <p key="4de5fcad-6da1-433d-bec1-dfccc88b862d">
   Afterwards in the palace kitchen, Po was challenged by Wo Hop to a fight to the death in order to restore his honor, and the rabbit chef made several attempts to attack Po and end his own life, the panda preventing him from doing so again and again. After several disasters (including the kitchen being set of fire and an ice dragon sculpture being beheaded), Po fell into despair, believing that he had disappointed everyone. After a comment from Wo Hop about

   being unable to solve everything, Po decided to call on the Furious Five and Wo Hop to help him in his preparations for the Feast. With their extra efforts, everything came together just in time. Tending to a last-minute detail, Po left to fetch some ground jasmine and saw the village houses decorated with colorful lanterns, and was sullen at seeing families together for their own feasts.

  <p key="e516f785-4d6f-4386-b578-694b556cc10b">
   Later, when seated with Shifu, the Five, and the visiting kung fu masters at the Jade Palace, Po was complimented by Shifu for creating the perfect feast. However, Po himself was unhappy as he sat with his fellow masters, and found that he could not enjoy the ceremony, as much as he admired the kung fu heroes present. He explained to them his own traditions of having fun with his family, friends, and neighbors during the holiday. He then politely excused himself (much to Shifu's dismay), and then ran off to join his father at the noodle shop.
  </p>
  <p key="6ca56ac5-b4b2-46f7-a64c-2418fe76e161">
   At the shop, Mr. Ping was pleased to see him, and apologized to Po for making him feel guilty, and Po offered to help him cook. They then worked together to make several bowls of holiday-themed noodle soup for the customers, who cheered for them. The Furious Five and the visiting masters later showed up at the restaurant and took part in the festivities as well. Po also presented the Golden Ladle to Wo Hop (whom had shown up to try and attack Po again), restoring honor to him and his home village.
  </p>
  <p key="b3e11b12-bbf9-4d0b-84fe-2159d2b27158">
   Shifu also came to the noodle shop, still upset that Po had "ruined" the palace feast, but upon seeing the happy celebration taking place inside, Shifu came to appreciate Po's decision. When spotted by the panda, the master was invited inside, and though reluctant to join in the feast, Po insisted, telling him that he was part of his family as well. They joined the others, posing for a group portrait, and Po was able to appease everyone, thanks of his unorthodox, yet sincere actions.

He sees that his parents had not abandoned him, as Shen claimed, but had both risked their lives to save him. His mother had hidden him in a crate of radishes before distracting Shen and the wolves to follow her alone. The tragedy of Po's past weighs heavy on him, but the Soothsayer reminds Po that it's his actions in the present that define him. Po reflects on all that he's accomplished, his friends and family, and finally understands who he is, thus finding inner peace.

Po replies that he thinks they are right where they are meant to be and that he "has the real things right here", while wrapping his arms around the Five and walking back with them to the palace. It appears that at some point he will later create a new set.

He tells Po there is more to being the Dragon Warrior than fighting and running through town giving high-fives. However, instead of emboldening his greatest student, Shifu's words plant the seeds of doubt in Po about his own identity.

   When he returned to the noodle shop to play with his action figures while bathing, Po is caught in the act by Mr. Ping, who could tell that something was bothering him. Po soon opened up about his insecurities about being a teacher and whether he was still the Dragon Warrior. Mr. Ping only caught the first half and became excited, knowing that it puts Po in a higher position to expand their franchise.

   Then suddenly, a pig burst in, announcing that a stranger was beating Po's dumpling eating record. Po went to the restaurant to investigate and was surprised to see the challenger to be another panda. The panda introduced himself as Li Shan and stated he was looking for his son. Both pandas were slow on the uptake until the assembled crowd groaned and Po and Li warmly embrace each other. Though a jealous Mr. Ping attempts to dispute whether Li was actually Po's biological father, the pandas ignored him as Po learned how to belly gong. Li then shared with Po that learned of his survival via "a message from the universe", and that there was a secret village of pandas.

Li then stated that he could teach him, but to do so, Po had to come with him to the secret village to rediscover the true meaning of being a panda. Believing his father's arrival was a sign from the universe, Po agreed to accompany him.

   , and learns more about his mother. However, when Tigress arrives with word that the other masters have all been defeated and turned into jombies by Kai, Po is dealt a second unpleasant surprise: his father has been lying to him about knowing how to control Chi out of the misguided belief that he was protecting his son from Kai's rampage. Angered, Po resolves to take Kai head on, but Tigress insisted Kai couldn't be beaten in a head-on fight, so Po insisted on using the Wuxi Finger Hold instead. However, Tigress poked the holes in his plans by reminding that Kai sees through the eyes of his jombies, making it impossible to sneak up on him. They are then approached by Li, Mr. Ping, and the other pandas, who volunteer to stand with him and learn kung fu to battle Kai. Po is initially hesitant, but when Li claimed that they could learn to be like Po, he then realizes what Shifu tried to help him learn: that in teaching others he needs to help them become their best selves, not duplicates of their teachers. He thus set about helping the pandas become kung fu warriors in their own way, and soon his "army" faced off with Kai's force of jombies.

The charging bull quickly managed to catch the tripping Dragon Warrior and then heaved him high up to the air, before leaping an delivering a back-flip kick. Unconscious and beaten, Po crashed through the Panda village entrance and defeatingly proclaimed to the others to flee. However, Po then hit upon an alternative strategy, and used the hold on himself while grabbing Kai in order to send them both to the

   . Furious, Kai began to knock Po back and after barely dodging his jade swords, the Spirit Warrior pulled a large rock which caught Po and used a chi-enhanced punch through it. He then started to steal Po's Chi as he had the other masters', but Po then received unexpected aid: the villagers and Tigress unlocked the power of their chi and in so doing helped Po master his own. With his new power, Po manifests his chi in the form of a dragon while acknowledging that as the son of a panda, the son of a goose, a student, and a teacher, is what makes him the Dragon Warrior, and fought Kai again. After destroying his two jade swords, Kai swore to take Po's chi even if it took him another five hundred years, to which Po only mocked him, provoking him into attacking. Po then willing gave his chi to Kai, overloading him with the immense power, destroying him and freeing the masters he had captured, including Oogway.

   The battle having knocked him out, Po was roused by Oogway, who was pleased with how much Po had matured. He revealed that he was the one who sent Li the "universe mail". He also revealed that reason why he chose Po as Dragon Warrior was because when he first laid eyes on him, he saw the future of kung fu in Po, as well as the pandas who taught Oogway chi in the past, making Po the perfect embodiment of the yin-yang and Oogway's true successor. Oogway then presented Po with a

   . Though Po was hesitant to take it, he accepted after Oogway mentioned he possessed a bigger staff. After fencing with his new staff, Po asked Oogway what was going to happen next. The tortoise then seemed to vanish in a cloud of petals, making Po panic, only to discover that Oogway wasn't going anywhere, as he was already home. After being told that he could decide whether or not to return, Po was able to use his chi to return to the physical realm. Having emerged triumphant, Po was happily embraced by his fathers and fellow masters. As he greeted Shifu, the latter expressed his pride that the student had finally become the teacher, but got caught off after noticing Po's new staff. Po explained that it was a gift from Oogway, to Shifu's annoyance, before asking if Po could teach him.

   Po possesses a kind and selfless nature, and is generally friendly and laid back. He also has a strong sense of justice, and is willing to risk his life to protect others. Though immature and oblivious in some situations, Po is able to take things seriously when it is called for, and is not hesitant to accept heavy responsibility—at times taking on more than he can handle. He is also capable of learning things very quickly with the right motivation, as shown in the first film, and has memorized a vast amount of knowledge about kung fu, even being reliable enough to teach a class on his own.

   Po also displays an action-craving attitude along with a natural affinity for humor, and isn't above acting clownish and dishing out quips, even making fun of himself, in order to entertain others. Imaginative and adventurous, he continues to act excitable and marvel over his heroes even after he has become the

   , at times leaving them embarrassed by his behavior. As Po tends to be less serious and disciplined than other masters, he also tends to think more outside the box, and will find different, creative ways to solve a problem if need be. Po has also broken some rules and traditions (as well as still having a habit of breaking physical things), though this is often unintentional. Po's lack of discipline and flippant personality often give him an unintentional advantage over his enemies, since, combined with his appearance, it causes them to disregard him or struggle to take him seriously, so they are often shocked when he proves to be a tenacious and incredibly skilled warrior.

   is Po's struggle to not let his title affect his ego. Throughout the series, he is shown to have many adoring fans and he welcomes the attention, occasionally to the point that it begins to negatively impact his duties or those around him.

He was also persistent enough to not heed the warning of his friends and endanger himself in order to find answers about his past. However, after finding the truth about
   what happened to his parents

   and having to please both him and Ping, Po finally starts to reveal how for all his light-heartedness and optimism, he is not without limits. While confident in his fighting ability, Po is forced to reflect inwardly and rely on his mind and spirit in order to fully understand himself and, therefore, master Chi. He approached the challenge enthusiastically and diligently, but displayed anger, frustration, and doubt when Li admitted to lying. Po was quick to forgive his father, and, quickly adapts to his circumstances to defeat Kai.

   Po has not only matured since his days before learning kung fu, but his unlikely triumph as the Dragon Warrior has changed those around him. Simple, good-natured, and fueled by determination, Po has never held grudges, not even against those who doubt him or treat him with contempt, and is selfless when it comes to protecting those in need, even being able to show compassion for his enemies. Po is much like the opposite of the foes he faces, such as Tai Lung, Shen, and

   , in that he shows light-heartedness and humility instead of arrogance and desire for more power. It is these qualities, as well as his great respect for kung fu and his loving heart, that mark Po as the Dragon Warrior, able to defeat such villains when no one else could.

   . This led to a mild argument between the two as Po tried to fix things so his father could come while Mr. Ping insisted he had to stay at his restaurant, begrudgingly telling Po to "do the right thing." In the end, Po dismissed himself from the banquet at the palace, unable to enjoy it, and spent the holiday cooking with Mr. Ping, who apologized to Po for making him feel guilty.

   .
   When Mr. Ping heard Po was going to become a teacher, Mr. Ping thought it was a promotion and that Po should go for it since it would mean one day Mr. Ping could serve noodles in the jade palace. He also became upset when Li showed up and declared himself Po's father. While when he first saw Li and heard his story, he recognized he was Po's father but denied it and tried to separate the two. He even followed them when they went to the Secret Panda village. Po clearly knew of Mr. Ping's feelings, considering how annoyed he was with Ping following him, but ultimately decided to let him come along. He tried to be there for Po and prevent him from bonding with his biological father too much. He even tried feeding him buns and tried finding him around the village. When Kai is coming, he wanted Po to run with him but Po, disillusioned with how both Li and Ping just wanted to run, coldly turned his back on his adopted father just like he did with Li. He even declared to Li he was scared Li would steal Po from him, but realized that Li being in Po's life didn't mean less for Mr. Ping but more for Po. He joined the fight against Kai and when his son was sent to the Spirit Realm, he was extremely worried and sent some of his chi to Po, saying Po gave him a family. He was happy when Po came back and told him never to do that again. By the end of the film, the bond between Po and Mr. Ping remains strong as the two still acknowledge each other as family even when Li is reintroduced into Po's life.

   Like Po, Li is shown to enjoy eating and having a good time. When they first meet, Li is shown stuffing dumplings in a similar manner to Po and the two were both fairly oblivious that the other is their family until they belatedly realize it and embrace. They enjoy bonding and even played with the weapons of the Hall of Warriors. Po showed off the hall of heroes and his fighting abilities to make Li proud, though this only made Li worry for his safety. Po followed his father to the village when his father claimed to be able to teach Po how to use Chi to stop Kai. His father took him to the village, along with Mr. Ping who sneaked in and was introduced to the many relatives and pandas there. His father also began teaching him how to be a true panda, such as sleeping in and eating more than one dumpling at a time and yawning and other panda activities.

   After some bonding time, Li then took Po to the altar with his wife's picture, explaining the grief he felt over not protecting his family. Po promised he would not leave him but after learning his father lied about being able to teach him chi, he felt betrayed since his lie cost him his friends and Po couldn't protect them or the valley as he left to learn chi in the village. In his anger, Po coldly denounced Li as his father and decides to stay in the village rather than evacuate to train and battle against Kai, leaving Li distressed as he just wants to protect Po, haunted by the events of the past that separated him from his family which was why he lied, but Mr. Ping teaches him that no matter what Po would be his son and forgive him and what was important was that both of them be there for Po. Po's faith in his father is restored when he becomes the first alongside Mr. Ping to volunteer to help, persuading the village to as well. He even aided him against the fight with Kai and his jade zombies. When Po sent himself and Kai to the spirit realm, he watched in horror and was the first to mimic the chi technique he saw in the scroll and gathering the others to follow so he could lend his chi to his son to fight Kai. He and Mr. Ping were overjoyed upon seeing Po alive and he began training under his son alongside the citizens of the valley of peace and the other pandas, proud of Po and the two reunited as family.

However, he clumsily came upon several training mechanisms, Shifu and the Five merely watching him in his struggle, and Shifu only pleased to see the panda having a hard time. Though Po was discouraged that Shifu could ever make him into the Dragon Warrior, he received some advice from Oogway to concentrate on the moment instead of doubting his abilities.
  </p>
  <p key="86f312ea-95d3-4e1b-a826-b5a1002ea3bf">
   That next morning the red panda was convinced Po had quit as his quarters were empty, but he saw that Po had instead arrived at early the training courtyard to "warm up". Annoyed, Shifu later set him up with many brutal sparring matches with the Five and himself, again hoping it would drive the panda to quit. However, Po only demonstrated an eager fearlessness to continue despite failing and getting pummeled every time. Infuriated, Shifu kicked the panda out of the training grounds and down the palace stairs himself.

   and was returning, and that Po was the only one who could stop him. Po was alarmed and fled, but was stopped by Shifu outside the palace stairs. Po then confronted the master about how he'd been trying to get rid of him, and that neither of them really thought he was the Dragon Warrior. Shifu asked him why he hadn't quit in spite of everything, and was taken aback when Po admitted that being beat and humiliated was still better than living every day being himself, and hoped that by staying, the kung fu master could change him. When Po demanded just how Shifu could actually help him to win against Tai Lung, Shifu was at a loss and quietly retreated without an answer.

  <p key="942cd63c-90b1-458a-a0e4-3c4bbb8ca669">

   , eating everything he could find in his distraught state. Shifu was astounded to see that Po displayed an unintentional talent in kung fu while trying to rummage the place for more food, even making a perfect split while doing so. Shifu understood that the best way to teach him was to use food as motivation, and with that, he took the panda to the

   . He proclaimed that he would be Po's master and would teach him kung fu, much to Po's elation. During an intense period of training, the two formed a bond of friendship and trust, and Shifu saw Po's mastery and humility in a final test of "keep away" using a dumpling as the prize. Though Po won, he gave back the dumpling, declaring with confidence that he wasn't hungry, and ended bowing respectfully to his master, with Shifu bowing to him in return.

But when the scroll turned out to be blank, both Po and Shifu were confused, neither seeing how Po could defeat the snow leopard on his own. With Tai Lung approaching, the Five were ordered to to evacuate the Valley, while Shifu declared he would

After the master trailed off and closed his eyes, the panda pleaded with him not to die, only for Shifu to yell back that he wasn't dying, he was only at peace, and master and student shared a long meditative moment side by side, until Po interrupted, asking if Shifu wanted to get something to eat, which the red panda agreed to after a sigh. Po and Shifu then shared a meal of dumplings at the

He also appeared to be slightly jealous that Po had mastered

   Po, along with most others, had never heard of Kai, much to his annoyance. When he sent his jade warriors to fight the Furious Five and Po, he was happy to have found Po and set his sights on eliminating him. Po went to the Secret Panda Village to learn chi to defeat Kai and when he learned his father had lied about teaching him chi, he decided to stay in the village to confront Kai. Tigress warned him that Kai was too powerful, with Po denying the claim and telling her he would use the Wu Xi finger hold on Kai, but Tigress warned him he wouldn't even be able to get close to him. Po then agreed and trained the villagers to fight Kai to distract him long enough to get a hold of Kai and use the Wu Xi finger hold on him. When he realized that didn't work, he decided to use it on himself and send Kai with him. Kai, angered that Po had sent him back, engaged in a fight with him, which Po ultimately won.

   The two did not spend much time together but it is clear they hate each other. Po hates him for destroying the Valley of Peace and turning his friends and the other masters into jombies while Kai saw him merely as an obstacle to defeat. Unlike the previous two villains, Kai did have some respect for Po since the very beginning, having understood Po was a formidable opponent he needed to defeat to accomplish his goals. Moreover, Po was also the only one that remembered Kai's various titles (i.e; "beast of vengeance" and "maker of widows") and history, making Kai thankful to the point of mentioning that it almost made him want to spare Po's life. However, he still underestimated him which led to his downfall. Po also respected Kai's amount of skill, understanding he would need help to get close enough to defeat Kai and thinking his jombies were cool. He also showed his respect when he called Kai by his long self proclaimed titles such as maker of widowers, which made Kai happy enough to almost not want to kill him. However, Po did taunt him at times, calling Kai chatty and using sarcastic gestures. Kai was annoyed when Po sent him back and promised he would defeat him but ultimately lost.
