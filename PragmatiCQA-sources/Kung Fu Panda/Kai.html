   to heal Oogway. Fascinated by the power, Oogway was taught by the pandas on how to utilize it. Kai, however, became interested solely in using it to take over the world by increasing his own power, so he began taking chi from others rather than giving it. Seeing the damage Kai's obsession would cause, Oogway broke off his relationship with Kai, and the two former friends
   fought
   fiercely until Oogway finally triumphed, banishing Kai's body and soul to the Spirit Realm.

   Five hundred years after his banishment to the Spirit Realm, Kai, having become vengeful and power-hungry over time, underwent a physical transformation
   : his mane grew longer and more unruly, and Kai's general regalia, consisting of an armored uniform, was gone. In this time, Kai challenged Oogway to a

   , whom he loved like a brother. Kai was willing to risk his own life in order to keep Oogway safe; after the tortoise was injured in an ambush, Kai carried him for days across hostile terrain in a desperate attempt to find help. However, their relationship was broken beyond repair after stumbling upon the panda village and discovering the power of chi. Unlike Oogway, Kai became interested in stealing the chi of others in order to increase his own power, learning how it could be taken as easily as it was given. Because Oogway prevented him from fulfilling his ambition and imprisoned him for centuries in the Spirit Realm, he felt Oogway betrayed him and had never, or would ever, recover from the pain of losing the only person he ever truly loved.

   , to exact total vengeance against Oogway by destroying his legacy. Kai's disposition was worsened, if anything, during his time in the Spirit Realm as his sense of humor was darkened, and where there was once loyalty and honor, cruelty and aggression had replaced. To further his lack of morals, Kai was blinded by his own repute and was devoted heavily to his legacy, displeased that none recalled or even had heard of Kai, the "Beast of Vengeance" or "Maker of Widows" and so had no qualms whatsoever about destroying Oogway's legacy, believing that he had destroyed his. However, Kai was quite pleased when Po addressed him with said titles, even thanking him quite politely and claiming that it made him almost want to spare his life. Of course, that did not stop Kai from trying to steal Po's chi along with the rest of the pandas. Kai was also often annoyed by Po's sense of humor and underestimated him, just like nearly all of Po's previous adversaries, but he was ultimately defeated by Po who overloaded him with chi, leading to his demise.

   Kai was an extremely powerful warrior and easily one of the strongest warriors known to have walked China. Even in his youth, Kai's skills as a warrior had earned him the title of warlord and he was able to fight against

   </a>
   , who was considered the most powerful kung fu master in history until Po became the Dragon Warrior, in a battle so intense that it "shook the earth." Five hundred years later, Kai had become even more powerful, as he was able to make short work of all the kung fu masters in China and could fight evenly with and eventually defeat Oogway, though it was due to Oogway surrendering to him willingly that he was able to defeat Kai.
  </p>
  <p key="4d8b1e5b-2306-4a25-b032-5de36cf9630b">
   During his days with Oogway, he showed remarkable knowledge and wisdom about military protocols and logistics, being able to lead a large army without any form of difficulty.
   This also foreshadows his tactical leadership capabilities. He also possesses extremely strong willpower, being able to carry Oogway for days through extremely harsh environments, until they arrived at a medicinal village, where the Pandas managed to revive Oogway from the brink of death.
  </p>
  <p key="19b671f8-898d-4a72-b17d-c30935141800">
   In unarmed combat, Kai's veteran Kung Fu skills, honed from centuries of practice, allowed him to effortlessly outmatch every member of the Furious Five, Shifu and even Po before his mastering of chi. His unique fighting style was ferocious and direct, utilizing wide sweeping kicks and devastating horn-charges combined with powerful punches augmented in both strength, speed and accuracy by his stolen chi power. Kai possessed incredible supernatural strength, enough to tear down and swing a statue and cleave small mountains in half. He also displayed extreme supernatural durability, beyond the likes of pandas. He was able to take the worst hits from Oogway, Tigress, and Po's Dragon Form with only slight injuries and slight tardiness. Yet for all his power and skill, Kai's fighting style had its own fatal flaws for it was weak in and highly unsuited to prolonged combat due to it lacking any sufficient defensive capabilities or maneuvers geared specifically towards fighting multiple opponents simultaneously for more than a few seconds at a time, forcing him to rely heavily on his jade swords, chain whips and jade zombies for defense.
  </p>
  <p key="cd767574-5414-44e1-9424-57f05f9974c7">
   Fierce and dangerous in close combat, Kai wielded a pair of jade swords attached to long chains, which extend and abbreviate mystically from around his wrists.
   He wielded them as his primary weapons in combat, but also used them to scale cliffs and other terrain that he couldn't traverse normally.
  </p>
  <p key="b4cf1aa5-b2fc-4167-a3a7-6eadbccfdce3">
   Kai was a supernatural being with magical powers. Due to his ethereal "spirit" physiology, Kai was a

   , rendering him immune to fatigue, age and disease as well as most forms of physical harm in the mortal realm. He could also, when needed, summon jade soldiers to do his bidding and could see, hear, and feel everything that they could; in other words, he had a telepathic link to them. However, this could be used against him to distract him, as when Po tried to keep his attention occupied with help from the other pandas and use the Wuxi Finger Hold on him. Unfortunately, it failed because the Finger Hold could only affect mortals, not spirits. This implies that he is immortal since he is not even alive in the first place, in essence at least. However, this does not mean that he is beyond destruction.
  </p>
  <p key="0ab86cf4-eb51-408d-82b1-cb8d199fc443">
   He also possessed other supernatural abilities; most notably was the power to steal other warriors' chi. After he had absorbed the chi from a warrior, Kai's already extraordinary physical powers would increase exponentially. However, he takes a long time to absorb a Panda's chi due to their immense levels of it, whereas it took him mere seconds to absorb Oogway's and every other kung fu master's chi. An example would be when it took him several minutes to nearly absorb all of Po's chi. But if a being's chi and mastery over chi is far greater than his own, then he cannot absorb their chi. In addition, Kai could use his natural chi as well as all of the stolen

   to enhance the power of his physicality for even greater supernatural strength, speed, and agility; with one chi-infused flick of his finger, he almost knocked out

   . He even used a chi-infused strike to send Po flying through a gigantic rock and wounding him despite his immense durability. He can even use the chi to increase his natural healing potency or heal other beings from injuries and illness.

   Kai, though extremely powerful, was not without his weaknesses. Should an opponent utilize chi to fight him, the result would cause damage, as seen when Tigress was able to briefly stun him with a chi-enhanced kick at the Jade Palace, which broke through his invulnerability and Oogway similarly could knock him down and cause him some pain with a blast of chi. Another example is when Po used a chi-based Dragon construct to hurt him, and he succeeded. This is likely due to the fact that since Kai is a supernatural being, a supernatural force, such as chi energy, must be utilized to cause him harm or even destroy him. This was seen when Po overloaded him with powerful chi energies, which caused his "final death".
  </p>
  <p key="4b8ada4b-9efb-41f0-8712-92068aa03fd6">
   The actual methodology of sealing Kai into Spirit Realm used by Oogway in the past is unknown, and it is also unclear whether or not this 'sealing' was physically defeating.
  </p>
  <p key="12a59160-c813-4172-9092-9047ad92cff4">
   As noted in the previous section, Kai's jombies are a weakness as well as a strength. As Po theorized and later proved, assaulting the jombies all at the same time left Kai open to retaliation due to him being paralyzed due to sensory overload.

  <p key="b602ae11-8153-4e24-a7c9-f9e7a1b50d3d">

   Kai shared a close and brother-like relationship with Oogway, loving him a great deal. After an ambush led to Oogway being badly wounded, Kai carried him for days through the harshest of elements until reaching a Panda Village where the pandas used their chi to save his life. Fascinated by the power, Oogway learned from the pandas how to use chi to give life, but Kai saw a darker use for it, wishing to steal the chi from other warriors to increase his own power. Kai and Oogway's relationship became broken beyond repair and battled fiercely until Oogway banished Kai to the Spirit Realm. Five hundred years later, Kai mentioned to Shifu how he felt betrayed by Oogway.

However, Kai gained a morsel of respect for Po when the panda was impressed by his entrance in their meeting and mentioned Kai by name and called him by his various titles; he thanked him quite politely and even claimed that it almost made him want to spare Po's life. Nevertheless, this did not stop Kai from trying to take the chi of Po and all the other pandas. Kai also continually underestimated Po's cunning, strategy, and power, allowing Po to gain the upper hand in their battle, first in the Panda Village and then in the Spirit Realm.

   Kai's desire to absorb Po's chi proved to be his downfall, as the power of the Dragon Warrior's chi dragon avatar was too great to handle, causing Kai to be destroyed in a blast of light.
