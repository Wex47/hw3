Before he could take his leave, both Po and Temutai tried to convince Peng to train with one of them, almost turning into a fight until Shifu declared it was Peng's choice. The young snow leopard decided to train with Po at the

   Later, he met up with Po in the Training Hall again, where the Dragon Warrior haltingly told Peng that Shifu had dismissed the young potter's skills as a warrior.

   During their fight, Peng got Temutai on the defensive when they were interrupted by Jing Mei. Not wanting to get involved he quickly excused himself, much to his uncle's fury. Finally, Po showed up and tried to stop the fight; but Peng refused to back down, exclaiming he "practiced his kung fu without any plans, no expectations, and no dreams" until Po "gave him one" and Shifu "snatched it away".

Tai Lung instructed Peng to destroy everything, including the innocent, but before Tai Lung could hurt anyone, Peng stopped him, stating that he was nothing like Tai Lung and took the medallion off himself. Tai Lung then transformed into Po (who used a

He returned once more as he and Lian have start an illegal fight club to teach the average person kung fu to protect themselves. Po is sent by Shifu to investigate the club and shut it down. When Po accidentally reveals himself, Peng, disguised, challenges him. Peng lands an unintentionally powerful kick that knocks Po out. When he wakes up, Peng explains to him why they started the fight club. Po is moved and decides to join the club, much to the two snow leopards' delight. With the Dragon Warrior assisting them in training, the participants of the club are easily able to defeat the thugs, prompting

   Tong Fo finds Peng and knowing that he is Tai Lung's nephew, attempts to sway him over back to evil. He also threatens to kill Lian if he refuses, so Peng reluctantly complies at the next meeting, where he apparently kills Po with a poisoned needle. However, Peng double-crosses him, and in retaliation, Tong Fo orders Lian killed. Lian manages to free herself before Tong Fo's men could do so, and yells for a free fight between the participants and the thugs. Peng defeats Tong Fo, who is left at the mercy of the other participants. Shifu, who also attended in disguise, reveals himself after the fiasco is over. He initially expresses disappointment at the three, but soon reveals that he enjoyed the club and informs them that he will lift the sanction of the fight clubs, believing that kung fu should be shared by all after what he witnessed. Peng and Lian then leave the Valley of Peace the following morning, to set up more fight clubs across China.

  <p key="e0b1a4ca-d05b-416d-b469-5746c5f57b08">
   Peng is shown to be modest and rather humble for someone so skilled, as he didn't actually want to fight until

   forced his paw. Even so, Peng showed a sense of determination that reflected that of
   <a href="Tai Lung.html" key="fcf40ae1-bcd0-4097-878b-fa307bb4544f" title="Tai Lung">
    his uncle
   </a>
   , in that while he may not seek out fights, he will do whatever it takes to finish them on his own terms.
  </p>
  <p key="f9985625-cc7e-41e5-97bc-29f4facd9d02">
   Being young, he understandably got excited by the opportunity to train in the Jade Palace with Shifu, the Furious Five, and Po, but he seemed to share Tai Lung's ambition in proving himself, shown when he recklessly sought to defeat
   <a href="Temutai.html" key="441defc6-5ac3-4c8a-9cb6-82ac160a5a61" title="Temutai">

   </a>
   to prove himself worthy. He claimed he had practiced his kung fu without expectations and no dreams until Po gave him one, hinting he might be self-taught and had done so with great effort.
   This also implies that he is similar to Tai Lung, in the respect how Tai Lung was filled with hopes of being Dragon Warrior only to have the title not given to him, resulting in the darkness of his heart emerging and harming people. He even attacked Po when he found out he killed his uncle, though stopped after learning Tai Lung was evil. Throughout his appearances, Peng struggles between doing what is right and the belief that he will follow Tai Lung's descent to darkness as his nephew which is something he fears the most, but Po is always there to remind him that he is nothing like Tai Lung and is truly a good person at heart.
  </p>
  <p key="6dceda12-8192-4628-9666-2ef5d89d2c84">
   Even so, Peng was shown to be far more forgiving than Tai Lung was, as he forgave Po for lying to him and hurting his feelings and pride. It is possible that Peng possesses all the positive aspects Tai Lung himself once had when he was his nephew's age.
  </p>
  <p key="7b41354e-3e19-42d6-bc12-3715af880998">
   He also fears of being evil, so to avoid this from happening, he quit kung fu.
   However, after meeting Lian, he decides that it wasn't kung fu that was corrupt but the manner in which it was kept secret from the public with only the masters at sanctioned palaces being able to practice it, showing what appeared to be bitterness at the hierarchy ad power struggle that came with it as he seemed to being to resent the power the palace held. However, after Po found out about his illegal fight club (since amateur kung fu is banned) and showed he wholeheartedly supported it, Po seemed to improve in his vision. He eventually sees this as his true purpose and states he has never been happier, especially with Lian at his side and he may have finally found inner peace both with his identity as Tai Lung's nephew and the fact that he was nothing like his uncle.

   Lian is the girlfriend of Peng. He cares greatly for her well being. While it is unknown how they met, what is known is that she is the main reason Peng decided to give Kung Fu a second chance along with a purpose in his life as he now devotes himself to teaching the average person kung fu by establishing Kung fu clubs. The two get along well, as the two are fairly intimate with each other, holding hands and talking about their feelings, and even kissing each other on the cheek. When Tong Fo threatened to kill her if Peng didn't kill Po, Peng complied but Po had enough faith in Peng that he wouldn't kill him and afterwards Peng wanted revenge on Tong Fo for what he did to his girlfriend, sending him flying as a result.
