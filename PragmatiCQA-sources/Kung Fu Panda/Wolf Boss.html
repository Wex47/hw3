   Boss Wolf was next seen on Shen's ship as the fleet traveled through the city on its way to the harbor to begin its conquest, and was witness to Po's unexpected appearance and the
   battle
   that ensued between the kung fu masters and the wolf army. During this battle, it quickly became apparent that the kung fu masters were winning. Fearful of being defeated, Shen ordered Boss Wolf to fire at the barrier of wreckage blocking their way to the city harbor. He hesitated, noting the amount of powder in the wreckage and arguing how some of his pack would be killed as a result. But Shen had no concern over any loss of his soldiers, and ordered Boss Wolf to fire. Realizing that Shen took no regard of the lives of his own army, Boss Wolf refused, and for his defiance, Shen threw one of his blades, striking Boss Wolf without a second thought, and then proceeded to fire the cannon himself after the wolf had fallen.

   Though Boss Wolf usually carried out Shen's commands without hesitation, he hesitated when Shen ordered him to fire his
   cannon
   during the final
   battle
   with the kung fu masters, which would mean killing their own soldiers. The wolf refused, and was struck down by three of Shen's blades as a result. This defiance showed that while Boss Wolf was ruthless toward his enemies, he was nowhere near as evil as Shen, and cared for the lives of his own warriors. He was also shown to be almost puppy-like at times, as shown by his talking too much and making Shen angry with his bumbling comments.

   The Boss Wolf wears dark metal armor consisting of a scaled chest piece, gauntlets, and a cuisse of metal bands covering his thighs that allows for greater movement without sacrificing the metal's protection. The chest piece and cuisse are connected by an armored belt, and some rope is wrapped around his waist and his left gauntlet. Shen's red, eye-like emblem is seen on his right shoulder pad, with the left one sporting spikes. He has fabric wraps under his armor to help prevent chafing from the metal. The wraps can be seen in the space between his gauntlets and shoulder pads. His hock is covered with separate legwraps.
