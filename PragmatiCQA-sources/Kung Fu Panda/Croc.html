   . Beaten, Croc prepared himself for death, but the fatal blow never came. Thundering Rhino instead asked Croc to use his kung fu skills for doing good. Croc was so moved by Master Rhino's compassion that he immediately quit his criminal ways. He then traveled across China, following Rhino's advice to use his kung fu for good by righting wrongs and protecting the weak. Croc gained fame for his victorious deeds during this time. One such victory was his silencing of the
   Badger Bandits
   , who insulted Croc by talking about his mother.

  <p key="9f019e29-e6f0-4c9b-986b-7222a6b16ea7">
   After the fight, the warriors were given a single coin for their three-way-tie, which led to an argument between the three that nearly ended in another battle. Fortunately, Oogway soon appeared before they started fighting. Croc initially mistook Oogway for a fan and even prepared to sign a piece of paper he was holding, only to see that it is a wanted poster of the Wu Sisters. Oogway gave them the offer to journey to
   <a href="Wu Fortress.html" key="0c1e7fa0-4d99-40ff-8f17-74bfde102faa" title="Wu Fortress">
    Wu Fortress
   </a>
   and recapture the sisters using their special skills. However, the trio refused to join him unless they gained something in return. When Oogway's suggestions of using their skills for honorable reasons did not move the trio, the tortoise was forced to claim that they would be rewarded with a "wealth of riches". Seeing an opportunity to gain great fame, Croc finally agreed along with Ox and Rhino.
  </p>
  <p key="f79604cf-2884-4649-a09b-97499aa5d906">
   And so the three set off with Oogway towards the fortress, passing through various obstacles as they went. During the journey, Croc attempted to bargain with Oogway to dump the other two warriors and split the profits themselves. However, Ox and Rhino were doing the same thing, but Oogway ignored their offers. While surrounding a campfire one night, Croc made clear his selfish plans to buy a castle with his riches, where he can wave to his fans wearing all his capes. After listening to the trio and learning of their respective desires, Oogway gave them some cryptic advice; that when the path one takes always leads back to themselves, they will never get anywhere unless they "change course". Croc claimed that it was the worst "campfire story" he had ever heard. Before they could settle for the night, Oogway received news that the Wu Sisters were plotting to unify the gang leaders, and the group set out in order to reach the fortress as soon as possible.
  </p>
  <p key="df0a877e-984b-42db-be85-a50501206e31">
   To encourage them to change their ways, Oogway secretly led the trio into an extremely dangerous path called the
   <a href="Bridge of Mists.html" key="c3ba7428-df4b-4d76-90b4-1c4bbee8e131" title="Bridge of Mists">
    Bridge of Mists
   </a>
   . When the three inquired as to how they would get across, Oogway replied by flinging all three of them into the bridge, forcing them to prop themselves between the two pillars. Oogway then taught them all an important lesson about cooperation, by having crossing the makeshift bridge the three made up, pulling up Rhino as he did so, and then having them all make it across the bridge to the other side, pulling each other up as they went.
  </p>
  <p key="a4647145-e3f8-4c9b-a5a9-1ad8fbaed725">
   Later during the day, the trio and Oogway were climbing up the side of Wu Fortress, where they finally learned that Oogway was being metaphorical about his promised riches. Rhino's protests accidentally got them trapped on a river of lava when his heavy footsteps caused the ledge they were standing on to break away. Oogway managed to get them to safe ground, but fell to his apparent death, leaving them with only the advice "Remember the path." to guide them now.
  </p>
  <p key="a267ea9d-efaf-4f10-91a6-8500b6a0ba3e">
   Dispirited at their loss, the trio tried to find their way home. However, they encountered a village devastated by the Wu sisters' forces, and its citizens desperately attempted to hire them for protection. Moved by the villagers' plight, the trio declined the fee and resolved to stop the Wu sisters for the sake of a higher ideal.
  </p>
  <p key="302c75cb-52da-4276-a455-d84f62f25494">
   Thus motivated, the trio interrupted the sisters' summit. When the former street-fighters revealed that they were doing this for honor, they intimidated the various visiting gangs into retreating while the sisters fought alone. Although the sisters proved too much to fight alone, as Croc discovered when he was sent flying back by a hail of small rocks, Rhino, Ox and Croc managed to combine their talents to defeat them in a coordinated attack. After Ox deduced that the tail knot at the center of the vortex was their weakness, Croc charged at the vortex and brought it to a halt with his tough hide. Though the intense friction caused him pain, Croc was able to position the vortex enough for Rhino to charge through the knot and break the sisters apart. The trio then worked together to defeat the separated sisters, eventually trapping them beneath a large statue head.
  </p>
  <p key="96968dd2-3b39-468e-9262-482a1c3e6120">
   At the moment of their victory, Oogway reappeared, having captured the rest of the gangs, and praised Rhino, Ox, and Croc for being worthy warriors who had found a higher purpose to fight.
  </p>
  <p key="af782565-25ac-430d-ac5f-5eac974b6266">
   According to Po, after these events Oogway set Croc and his fellow warriors on a journey which eventually led them to Gongmen City where they formed the Masters Council.

   . Seeing them approach, the small guru proclaimed that the assassins wouldn't cross the borders, and that there was no need to flee to safety. He was proven right as Master Croc then arose from the waters and attacked the boats, using his

   Guru Llama was impressed by the crocodile warrior's "awe-inspiring, aquatic arsenal of excellence", and declared that Croc had defeated a number of one-hundred and seventy-three of the assassins. The crocodile himself remarked it wasn't a bad number, and Guru Llama light-heartedly told him that humility was as important to practice as kung fu. Croc replied to the guru that his victory on Chen Wei should nevertheless be remembered and retold. Later, two young llama children were seen burying another, unwilling child on the beach. They discover a boat on the shore and they run away in fright after seeing it was empty, while Croc was seen swimming away. And so another legend was born from Croc's adventure, and lived on through the children of the island, the legend that one of the "ghost ships" of Chen Wei would visit them if they misbehaved.

   Some time after Lord Shen had threatened to take over China, Master Croc's village was attacked by the resurrected General Kai's Jombies. With that, Croc left Gongmen behind, with Masters Bear and Chicken at his side, to track the jade zombies, who had headed out miles away from anywhere, in the Tavern River Bed, where a ship lay, long since run aground. At this time, Masters Crane and Mantis had met up with the three warriors and found the ship, derelict and deserted. Bear, brandishing his axes and roaring loudly, rushed into the old ship first, followed by Croc, who swung his sword and shouted a battle cry. Both warriors, followed by Chicken, Mantis and Crane respectively, were all captured by Kai and transfigured into more of his jade slaves.

   Further on, Croc and the other masters were released as jombies by Kai, with the instructions given by the yak general to round up all pandas in a panda village. In the ensuing chase, Croc, in his zombified form, attempted twice to seize Po, who had gone to look for the pandas, in his jaws. During the battle that resulted, Croc and Tigress battled on, at first
