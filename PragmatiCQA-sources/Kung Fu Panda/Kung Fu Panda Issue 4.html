   Some time later, Po and Heng conversed over dinner, during which Heng explained that after learning that Po had become the

   Infinite Obsta-Gauntlet Course of Trapishness
   . Po was stunned to discover that Heng had not only planned the course, but also had it built. Heng proceeded to challenge Po to a race. Po was at first reluctant, but then he remembered Heng's past treatment of him during their childhood, and seized the opportunity to finally best him.

   skills, Po maintained a steady lead throughout the course, and relished the fact that he was finally winning. However, during the last run to the finish line, the panda remembered a foot race Heng had won when they were children, and how Mr. Ping had warmly expressed his pride in Po's efforts, while Heng's parents had coldly admonished him for being "slow" despite his win. Po realized that Heng's competitiveness stemmed from a need to prove his self-worth. In an act of compassion, he pretended to trip mere meters from the finish line, allowing Heng to win. Heng was ecstatic, but then revealed that due to the funds required to have the course built, he had lost his home and his money.

   Shocked, Po demanded why Heng would do such a thing, and the pig explained that when he learned that Po had become the Dragon Warrior, he became obsessed with proving that he could still beat him. Po told Heng that he didn't have to prove anything, and admonished him for treating everything as a competition. Realizing that Po was right, Heng bid him farewell, only to be stopped by the panda, who had an idea to help Heng get his home back.

   And so, with the help of the Furious Five and Mr. Ping, they converted the obstacle course into a kid-friendly playground which promoted kung fu training. With the new course proving a lucrative success, Po told Heng that he would get his old house back in no time. Heng revealed that he wasn't going back to his old home, and intended to buy a mansion even bigger than Po's. When Po reminded him that he lived in the Jade Palace, Heng asked him if it was for sale, to which an annoyed Po refused.

   After a long journey
   through
   many
   dangerous
   hazardous
   locations, Po finally reached the Forest of Isolation, which was full of sticky mushrooms. Po quickly discovered the botongy plant, but was confronted by the
   Chinese Pangolin
   , the guardian of the forest. In reference to the Pangolin's claims that the greatest offense is a defense, his body was covered in plates, making physical blows useless and painful. However, Po persisted, striking the Pangolin all over while drenching him in sticky mushroom goop. The arrogant Pangolin stood completely still during this, and questioned Po over his apparently futile attempts. Po explained that he had no intention of letting Tigress down, and that his blows were meant to disguise his true intentions; the Pangolin then grew aware that the sticky mushrooms in his plates had immobilized him. After commenting that the greatest offense was actually the ability to problem solve, Po departed with the botongy plant.

   Back at the Jade Palace, Shifu explained to Po that thanks to the botongy plant, Tigress was recovering. However, no matter many times Shifu tried to explain, Tigress seemed convinced that the source of her illness was actually food poisoning from the dumplings Po had dropped some time ago. This resulted in a furious Tigress bursting from her room and chasing Po, who stated that he should have stayed in isolation.
