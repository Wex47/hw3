   However, watching the other candidates fail painfully in the obstacle course caused Crane to lose his nerve. When Mei Ling pointed out Crane after all the other candidates had failed, he was cruelly mocked by the instructor and the other students for his skinny legs, leading to further discouragement. The instructor set him to work sweeping up the teeth littering the floor. Crane, having given up, accidentally wandered into the obstacle course. Though the instructor urged him to slowly step out, Crane spied the red flag at the far end of the course, which a candidate was required to capture in order to gain a place in the school. With Mei Ling's encouragement, Crane attempted the course, and upon realizing that his skinny build actually enabled him to avoid the various traps, was filled with a newfound confidence. He quickly found a way to surpass the course, capturing the flag and passing with flying colors.

He came up with the rest of the Five when Po started to showcase his skills, watching and flinching as Po tumbled into the training course and failed each section. He joined in with the others that night in making fun of Po afterwards as they walked towards the

   When Po then tried to sneak into his room that same night, he made the floorboards creak every time he moved and, in trying to avoid that, accidentally stumbled into Crane's room while he was sleeping, waking him up. When Po awkwardly tried to start a conversation, Crane told Po, "I've had a long and rather disappointing day, so... yeah, I should probably get to sleep now." An awkward conversation ensued, during which Po accidentally kicked a hole in the material separating Crane and

   The next day, Crane had to help Po get unstuck from a full-split he had been attempting to do. He later sparred with Po, but before they could attempt to fight, Po fell into the tortoise bowl and banged around for quite a bit, with Crane having jumped off and hovered in the air above him. That night, as Po was being treated to acupuncture by

When the Five and Po ate together that same night, Crane greatly enjoyed Po's noodle soup, and laughed with the rest (excluding Tigress) at Po's "Shifu impression". He and the rest of the Five were later shocked at hearing of Oogway's passing from Shifu.

After Po and Tigress failed to convince the imprisoned Ox and Croc to join them, Boss Wolf and his soldiers arrived. The Five quickly dispatched the soldiers, and the leader fled with his enemies in hot pursuit. They eventually caught Boss Wolf outside Lord Shen's

The entrance was soon blocked, however, but Tigress devised an ingenious escape plan. While the tower slowly toppled over, Crane and the others quickly climbed up the tower and leaped off the top, over the palace walls, and escaped into the city.

   Crane and the others hid from the wolf army in Gongmen Jail, where Tigress angrily confronted Po over his letting Shen escape. When Po said nothing, Tigress decided that he should remain in the jail while she and the Five went after Shen. Crane and the others watched in fear as Po and Tigress sparred when the panda refused to remain behind. Po was quickly subdued, and eventually revealed his desire to question Shen about his forgotten past. Po also added, in referral to Tigress, that "the hardcore can't understand". Crane's jaw dropped when Tigress lunged at Po, apparently angered, but instead hugged him. Tigress stated that she did understand, but told Po to remain in the jail anyway and soon left with the other Five. While they were leaving, Crane asked Tigress if she "couldn't watch [him] be killed", to which she told him to "stop being a wimp".

   Crane and the Five tracked Shen to the cannon foundry, and then attempted to destroy the building by pushing inside a wagon full of lit gunpowder barrels. As they turned to leave, however, they spotted Po high up in the building battling Shen. They quickly doused the fuses and faced a mass army of wolves while Tigress attempted to reach Po. She was unable to reach him in time, and Crane and the others watched in horror as Po was blasted out of the factory by Shen's largest cannon, presumably to his death.

   Crane and the others of the Five were subsequently captured. The night after the battle at the factory, they were chained and dangled from the top of a ship as Shen's armada prepared to leave the city and begin their conquest of China. Deeply saddened by Po's apparent death, Crane remained quiet and despairing, up until Po miraculously reappeared. Po dodged Shen's cannons and succeeded in freeing the Five, who then proceeded to aid him in fighting the armada in hopes of destroying the ships. They were soon joined by Shifu, as well as Storming Ox and Croc (whom Shifu had persuaded to join the battle). Just as it appeared that they would win, however, Shen fired his huge cannon and blasted the warriors into the

   After the blast, Crane and the other masters were left floating on driftwood, too badly injured and exhausted to continue fighting. Po was the only one able to fight, so he swam to a sunken boat where he made his final stand against the remaining boats. Crane and the other masters then watched in astonishment as Po used his newly-acquired

Crane's jaw dropped once again when Tigress helped Po out of the water and then received a hug from him. Crane recovered from his surprise and joined the others and they gave Po a group hug, and then watched the fireworks display that resulted from the remains of Shen's ship.

   Crane has demonstrated a dry sense of sarcastic humor on occasion. In his spare time, he enjoys practicing the ancient art of
   Chinese calligraphy
   , especially as a way to meditate or wind down after a stressful day.
   Though brave and reliable, he also tends to show more nervousness than his companions. As demonstrated in the short "The Pull-Up Mandate", Crane tends to tease Po's physical looks when he stated "He can't even lift his arms!".

   In addition to his Kung Fu skills, Crane is always there to correct Po whenever he gets his facts wrong or needs to memorize a spell. Whether it's about Oogway's construction of the Jade Palace, figuring out where to find the Sacred Sun Orchid, or even how to stay calm in a disturbing situation, he always strives to inform and educate others when he has a chance. When a touchy subject arises, he'll give certain facial cues or use signals to hide any embarrassing details. In part one of the episode "Emperor's Rule", Crane gives Po a bag that features an ingredient used to supplement important vitamins in tea. He notes it'll help Po with that "problem" he has. When Po asks, "Which problem?", Crane uses an interesting facial cue: By looking down and up with his eyes, he signals to Po what the problem is. Of course, Po remembers, and thanks him. Not only is this a crucial moment in Crane's life, but it gives us the power to know how he thinks and what points he wants to get across.

   Crane also has a degree of kindness when it comes to his own actions, even before he gets to warm up with Po. When he unintentionally causes Po to self-depreciate after telling him that he doesn't belong "here," as he refers to the Jade Palace just now, he changes his statement quickly to just refer how Po doesn't belong in his room.

    The traditional
    Crane style
    is natural, graceful, effortless, fluid, and balanced. In traditional crane style, the fighter poses his striking hand similar to the long pointed beak of the bird. Crane does not use his beak, but instead, he utilizes his wings for big, circular sweeping movements designed to exploit his wingspan; by enlarging the striking zone, he diffuses his opponents' energy—using four ounces of energy to deflect one thousand tons of pressure.

   Master Crane loves his mother, but he was once afraid of her. In the episode "Mama Told Me Not To Kung Fu", she responded to his letters that he wrote about his new "job" at the Jade Palace. He lied to her so her heart wouldn't pulsate. He said he managed an inn, instead of admitting he was a Kung Fu master. When she came to visit him, he was annoyed with the way she tickled his feathers. Later, he offered to tour her on what the village had to offer. When lunchtime came, he exclaimed that he wasn't a baby when she tried to beak-feed him. Nevertheless, he reluctantly gave in to her demand. As the episode continued, he tried so hard to hide the truth of his life. Then, when the Wolf Bandits tried to seize her, he was forced to show her the truth when he used Kung Fu to defeat them. Although she was shocked at the sight of his moves, she realized how much he loved her. She praised him for saving her, and admitted that he looked good when it came to his health. Crane agreed to forgive her for misjudging his talent. After they hugged each other, she said farewell to the loyal friends who helped her, smiled at Crane, and flew off.

   At times, Crane jokes about Shifu to lighten the mood. In the series, during the episode "Invitation Only", he joins Shifu and the Five in a comedy act. While Shifu "drowns" in quicksand, Crane remarks "Never mind that. I'm a doctor who needs help fixing this sundial." Thus, Constable Hu gives a forced laugh.

   where Crane worked as a janitor. Watching him work late one night, she was amazed by his skill and told him to try out for enrollment at the school. She seemed to care about Crane and may have been his only friend when everyone else teased him for being too skinny. Her encouragement and belief in him inspired his decision to go on when he accidentally stepped on the course used to test applicants. When Crane passed the course with flying colors, Mei Ling cheered for him along with all the students who had doubted his ability.

He also wears rings around his ankles and toes: Five ankle rings on each of his legs, and a single toe ring on each of his toes.
