   ", he and Shirong used to travel around selling fake "healing" talismans, which the young Shifu painted himself to look old. He and Shirong usually managed to leave before people realized the talismans were fake and went after them. At some point, Shirong also introduced Shifu to

   eventually found the young red panda and allowed him to stay at the palace, where he trained him in the art of Kung Fu. It was a decade later that Shirong returned to the palace, offering to trade a "golden" sword for food and supplies, only for Shifu to discover later that the sword was made of wood. According to Shifu, whenever Shirong showed up in the past, it was always to con something out of him, which angered Shifu and convinced him to never trust Shirong.

That night, Po and the others found the room empty save for a locket, and deduced that he must have been kidnapped by the Croc Bandits. However, Shifu believed it was yet another of the old red panda's scams, and forbid any of his students from going after his father.

   . Unknown to them, the whole thing was also a setup planned by Shirong, who was working in league with Tong Fo. He had expected Po to come after him so that Tong Fo could trap Po, freeing him of being in the loris' debt, but was alarmed to see Shifu instead. His son tried to free him, but found that the chains were unbound, and soon he was found and knocked unconscious by Tong Fo. He was afterward chained himself, with Tong Fo aiming to make him a permanent prisoner. Though Shirong tried to protest to this, he left when Tong Fo threatened him.

   When Shifu and Shirong said goodbye, Shirong told his son that he was correct to leave him at the palace, as it was better than any home he could have given him. Shifu gave his father back the locket, which had had a picture of him when he was a child, and had replaced it with a picture of him and Shirong as they appeared in the present. The two hugged, and after Shirong departed, Shifu found that his father had given Po back all his money he'd conned out of him earlier. Thinking this was unlike his father, Shifu found his own money was gone, and was content with it being so.

After telling Po that Shifu was a good child, he chose to show him the "disappearing coin" trick, which ended every time with Po's coins disappearing. Despite being essentially robbed blind, Po was fascinated by this trick, and continued to give Shirong his money. At the Jade Palace, Shifu turned Shirong away, but Po insisted that he allow his own father to stay.
