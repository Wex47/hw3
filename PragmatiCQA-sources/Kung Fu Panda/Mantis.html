   After the tournament, Mantis and the other Five went over to the

    Training Hall
   </a>
   , where Mantis was seen training in the
   Gauntlet of Wooden Warriors
   . When Po and Shifu finally arrived, he appeared less than impressed when Po commented on his similar size of his
   action figure
   . Mantis then watched as Po sparred with the adversary, and was subsequently knocked into the training course where he failed each and every single course, including the Wooden Warriors.
  </p>
  <p key="c3030ca3-3d53-464f-a6e8-8a124097b5b5">
   That night, Mantis partook in making fun of Po along with his comrades while traveling up to the

   , unaware that Po was right behind them and could hear everything. The next day, when it appeared that Po had quit, they enter the training courtyard and found that he had gotten up and started training early, getting stuck in the process. As Po's training continued that day, most of the Furious Five sparred with Po, Mantis being the last before Shifu decided to spar with the panda himself. He watched Shifu fling Po around before kicking him out of the

   and down the steps. It was at this point that Mantis and the other Five (sans Tigress) began to notice Po's determination and started to have some respect for him (though it didn't stop him from mocking Po's bouncing, earning him a reprimand from Viper).

    Viper

   attempted to help Po recover using
   acupuncture
   . However, Po's bulk made finding the right nerve points difficult, thus Mantis caused Po even more pain each time he stuck a needle in his back. The three eventually started up a conversation, commenting on Shifu's harsh way of treating Po. Mantis would express regret for disparaging Po's physical size, ruefully remarking that he himself of all people ought to have remembered that one's size doesn't dictate how skilled they are. Eventually Tigress joined their conversation and told the story of

   while Mantis continued to apply more needles to Po's back. At the very end, he accidentally slipped up one needle and triggered Po's facial nerve, temporarily paralyzing him and stopping his heart. The humorous face he adopted almost caused Tigress to claw him, only being stopped by Mantis who explained the situation.
  </p>
  <p key="f1ad15f8-7d20-46ca-b8c1-1a42d23d134f">
   Later that night, Mantis and the others were dining together in the barracks kitchen. Po served his noodle soup to the Five (excluding Tigress), and Mantis took an extreme liking to it. He also laughed along with the others (again, excluding Tigress) when Po did an impression of Master Shifu. But when the master eventually showed up in the middle of Po's impression, Mantis immediately stopped laughing. He was shocked with all the others upon hearing Shifu's announcement of Oogway's passing and Tai Lung's breakout, and stuck by Tigress' side when she insisted they handled Tai Lung themselves. Later that night, after Shifu outlawed their request, Mantis and the others followed Tigress out of the Palace that night and joined together to find and stop Tai Lung.

  <p key="c0bb1817-7655-4501-bc48-b9c54affe306">
   After days of traveling, Mantis and the others finally located Tai Lung on the

   . A long battle ensues, each of the Five using incredible skill and prowess to fight the snow leopard. Mantis assisted by using his incredible strength to hold up the falling bridge while the other four and Tai Lung continued to battle. But when it seemed like they had won, Tai Lung reappears again and performs a chi block on four of the Five — only sparing

   Shifu and Po had just finished another day's worth of extensive training when they finally returned, Crane exhausted and the others paralyzed. The Five each told about their grieving experience, which placed doubt into Po when he realized that not even his idols, let alone five kung fu masters, could stop Tai Lung. But Shifu still believed he could defeat him, and they all went to the

   for Po. Shifu, Mantis, and the other Five watched as Po opened the scroll, and appeared just as confused when he said it was blank. Believing nothing else could be done, Shifu offered to stay behind to hold back Tai Lung while they and the rest of the Valley escape. Master and students shared a final respectful bow, knowing that Tai Lung may very well kill him.

   Returning to Gongmen Jail, now abandoned by the wolves, Tigress demanded from Po to know why he had hesitated. When Po eventually revealed that he wanted to know from Shen what happened to his parents, Tigress hugged him (to the shock of Mantis and the others), but decided to leave him with Ox and Croc while she and others continued their mission. The Five then

   Shen soon captured the Five and bound them in chains, planning on executing them once his ships reach the harbor to conquer China. Mantis sighed, feeling he and the others were doomed, and saying he had expected to settle down with a nice girl someday who would later eat his head. Then out of nowhere, Po appeared, having survived, and he freed the Five. The battle was soon joined by Storming Ox and Croc, who had been convinced by Shifu (who had also journeyed to Gongmen City) to leave their cell. But during the battle, Shen fired his cannon at the masters, blasting them all into the open water.

Immediately afterwards Mantis is seen desperately clinging onto a swinging spiked club and falling to the floor. Moments later he is seen chuckling to himself when Crane flies into Viper, only to have Crane fall on top of him. 
Mantis appears again with the rest of the Five and Shifu as they discover Po and his father playing in the

Pragmatic and open-minded with a dry sense of humor, Mantis was actually the first of the Five to develop acceptance and liking of Po as a person, alongside the factor of Po's girth, declaring size did little to define a warrior and could actually be used as an advantage, no matter what style one practices.
   Mantis is a strong defender of this philosophy of his, noted to being a tad sensitive regarding his own small stature (demonstrated when he impulsively whacked two enemy wolves who called him "cute").

   In "Kung Fu Shoes", he asked Mantis to watch him and make sure if he came close to achieving the status of Celestial Phoenix by performing the three needles test and when Mantis accidentally told him about an illegal market that sold black market which Po went to in order to get kung fu shoes that would allow him to become the celestial phoenix and get out of training, Mantis frequently advised him it was a bad idea.

   In "Maltese Mantis", Po insisted that Mantis go to the fest since he wanted to share with Mantis the experience, where enthusiasts came to trade action figures, play games, and reenact famous battle scenes despite Mantis being reluctant due to the fact he heard it was filled with geeks.

   In "Huge", when Mantis showed insecurity about his small size after losing to Lidong who is bigger than most, Po tried to comfort him to no success. After Mantis took a Gung-Tao potion to become bigger, Po supported him and said how awesome he was but when things got out of hand after Mantis took more of the potion to deal with Fung and Lidong, Po was the one to go get the antidote to fix Mantis.

   In Huge, Lidong seemed to be Mantis' greatest enemy he has ever fought before since this episode is focused on Mantis as the main protagonist and Lidong as the main antagonist. The problem has to do with Mantis blaming his size for losing to Lidong. When Mantis wanted to drink Gong Tau Potion, which he did of course, this only enraged Lidong. At the end of the episode, Lidong was defeated by Mantis and shrunk down to a fraction of his original size. This makes Mantis Lidong's greatest enemy yet since he caused him to be shrunk.
