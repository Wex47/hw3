   He is known as the Immortal Trickster.
  </p>
  <p key="bd114c15-beda-423b-b9df-acb74252525c">
   After defeating the White Bone Demon, he had an unwitting "rematch" with her and lost when, for reasons yet to be explained, he tried to steal the Red Jade of Lang Gong only to have it stolen from him in turn, along with his prized crown. Since the gods didn't believe him when he claimed he didn't have it, the now-empty red jade mines were turned into a cursed prison that he'd be unable to escape from unless one of two things happened: if someone visiting the mines were to correctly solve a riddle in the dream realms (which Nu Hai managed to do, unaware getting the correct answer is why he claimed to her horror that she "failed the test") or if he could find someone to take his place by sunrise (which he claimed to do in a dream-within-a-dream scenario, which Bao, Nu Hai, Jing, and Fan Tong managed to see through, and managed to wake up in time to keep from happening for real). Because the riddle was solved, Sun Wukong finally had permission from the gods to leave the mines and redeem himself. He followed the panda heroes and their families in disguise ("like a stalker", as Jing said) as to keep an eye on them looking for the right way to help them-- while having a little fun in the process, of course-- all in an effort to solve the mystery as to how the White Bone Demon robbed him and then reclaim his crown.

   Not long after introducing himself to the visiting panda heroes, he indirectly admitted himself to be a "total wack-job" before revealing that the immortal trickster they heard about and the creepy yet humble caretaker he pretended to be are one in the same. In fact, his time in isolation might've made him crazier then he originally was, but he is far from ignorant, especially on account of knowing his limits, like when he panics at the sight of someone else wearing his crown and its ability to have the wearer control him if aware of his presence. Those moments aside, Sun Wukong usually sees life as either a game of make-believe or an opportunity to play practical jokes. More often then not, those jokes tend to go too far, but he never seems to mean any harm to anyone other then his enemies, as is claims he's "just playing".

   He likes to see his own body as a temple, though-- in spite his immortality-- he claims that old age and lack of gym access is the cause of physical flaws such as exhaustion and having a muffin top. Odds are, he might see everything about himself as he claims to go wherever unseen forces like the gods send him... except when he doesn't.

   He seems to be skilled in monkey-style kung fu. In fact, those who vaguely recall him claimed he was a "legendary kung fu master"-- though when seen in person it is clear he is using a version that is a whole lot less polished then that of Master Monkey, albeit in a crude-but-effective way. Being the immortal trickster he is, Sun Wukong makes up for it by using various powers:

     Levitation
    </b>
    - Often seems to float through the air when mocking his opponents. Seems stronger in the dream realms.

     Shape-shifting
    </b>
    - Often does near-perfect impressions of others right down do their voices and skills, though his version of their personalities happens to be less then perfect, such as when he forgot that Po always makes time to eat no matter what, or when he didn't count on Fan Tong's chivalry to lead him into abandoning a harsh battle in favor of rescuing the empress. Only the most observant could see though his bad acting, though. Another way to recognize him is that, in several forms he takes, he maintains his mismatched eyes, though so far nobody seemed to recognize him for this trait at all. The biggest detail that blows his cover, however, is that-- when his disguise starts to unravel, his monkey tail shows up even when he's impersonating someone of another species. In fact, he admitted out loud that "the tell-tale tail gives {him} away everytime." In the dream realm, he could change himself into anything, including a target, just to mock those around him. In the real world, the main use of this ability, along with spying on everyone and-- at one point-- turning himself into the late Master Oogway just to mess with Po, seems to be changing his size, though no matter what his "aging" body wouldn't let him keep any of these forms for long, and he has to work as quickly as possible before it wears off and he returns to his true form.

     Doppelgangers

    - Can project several copies of himself all over the place, which turn into smoke when they take a hard enough hit, but are otherwise quite durable until the real deal gets hurt. In the dreamscape, he could make make several dozen versions of himself from midnight to "dawn", but in the real world, he can only split his consciousness five ways for a short amount of time, though he blamed that on old age.

     Dream Infiltration
    </b>
    - He can enter the dreams of others, and since the realm of dreams is limited only by the imagination, his powers seem to be greatly exaggerated in there, allowing him to play with his victims in any way he wants such as instantly changing the surroundings (ex. turned a stage into a kung fu training arena just by turning the dreamer upside down) or changing the details on a victim's body (ex. he had shrunk Bao and turned Jing's fists into bean bags).

   In addition to fighting and using magic, Sun Wukong seems to have other skills that he uses for his own pleasure if things were going his way:

    <b key="b4a16998-9f34-4e7c-8b04-da606e21a504">
     Cooking
    </b>
    - When Po and his students ended up in his mine/prison, Sun Wukong offered an entire buffet (no doubt laced with sleeping potion) as an act of "hospitality". He also made an entire meal for Ping, Li, Grandma, and Rooster and his henchmen to calm their nerves after playing a joke on them, though everyone (including Sun Wukong himself) had to admit that the dumplings were a bit soggy. Ping did compliment the noodles, though, saying they "aren't bad".

     Cleaning

    - His "man cave" in the mines he was imprisoned in doesn't have a single cobweb after his long imprisonment, and all he has to clean with was a crudely made broom.

     Craftsmanship
    </b>
    - Might've made everything he offered the pandas during their rainy-night stay, including a new pair of pants Fan Tong's size, pillows and beds with just the right comfort level, wax candles, and many other things. Also, he made a bunch of life-like wooden carvings of a bunch of travelers, and used them to freak everyone out when Rooster told a scary story about how the White Bone Demon used to turn her victims into dolls.

     Luxury spa treatments
    </b>
    - Done all he could to make the pandas feel comfortable during their stay at his prison. Also, after exhausting himself assisting them as part of a Plan B attempt at rescuing the empress from her regent, Sun Wukong is seen giving himself a mud-mask treatment with cucumbers while taking a break.
