   Violet is an intelligent inventor whose wits and skills have saved her and her siblings countless times from death. She has a habit of tying her hair back with a
   ribbon
   when concentrating to keep it out of her eyes.
  </p>
  <p key="ad5d03e3-1773-4e74-ae57-ead1c4116f27">
   Violet is possibly the greatest inventor of her time. Before the demise of her parents, she liked to visit the
   Verne Invention Museum
   and its many exhibits, including one of the mechanical demonstrations that inspired her to be an inventor when she was just two years old. When Violet was five years old, she won her first invention contest with an automatic rolling pin, which she made using a window shade and six pairs of roller skates. The judge praised Violet, saying she could invent anything with both her hands tied behind her back. When Violet was around ten, she invented a new kind of pencil sharpener.
   She also built a telephone from scratch
   and created a device to soothe her sister's teething pains.
   Her favorite inventor is
   Nikola Tesla
   .

   Though she is incredibly bright and intelligent, many things modern 14-15 year olds would know are unfamiliar to Violet, mostly because the series is set in an era in which access to information is more limited than it is today. For example, in
   <i key="bf9c74fb-2342-4466-988f-bbb75766ab46">
    The Wide Window
   </i>
   , Violet does not know what
   leeches
   are, likely due to her assumption that there was no need to read about them. Later, Klaus mentions there's "something funny" about

   suicide note, but Violet misinterprets this as "humorous" instead of "odd" and tries to dismiss
   Klaus
   ' point about a secret message in the letter (in the live-action versions, Violet catches on to his suspicions faster). During these moments,
   Klaus
   ' passion for reading comes in handy since he shares his knowledge in a wide range of subjects, allowing his older sister to become more aware of the world around her. Despite such occurrences, Violet is still committed to learn about the world and is willing to admit she does not know much about something.
  </p>
  <p key="621ea59d-2943-4ca3-879d-3e97ab44ef1b">
   After her parents' deaths, Violet was forced to take charge. Though she often collaborates with
   Klaus
   , she always feels the weight of being the oldest sibling. Her parents said to her when Klaus was born, and again when they brought Sunny home from
   Pincus Hospital
   , "You are the eldest Baudelaire child, and as the eldest, it will always be your responsibility to look after your younger siblings. Promise us that you will always watch out for them and make sure they don't get into trouble."
   This is why she invents the
   grappling hook
   to free Sunny from the tower; she risks her safety and well-being to help her siblings and honor the promise she made her parents to always keep her siblings away from harm.
   This promise is mentioned in all thirteen books.
  </p>
  <p key="e7e77572-794f-4e11-bcdb-2637f28c425c">
   However, Violet occasionally struggles with keeping herself and her siblings safe. She can be reckless on occasion, even when there are more sensible and safer alternatives. For example, upon learning that

   She can also be very rebellious when faced with corrupt authority figures, often calling them out and refusing to go along with them, such as when she removed her blindfold during the trial in the Netflix series, saying, "Maybe this court deserves contempt." In the film, she interrupts Olaf just to call him "pure evil." As the series progresses, she questions others more and becomes more outspoken about her beliefs, and less being persuaded by adults and trying to avoid confrontation.

   opened a can of condensed milk for them with her teeth. In the process, she spoke her first word- "Bite"- which impressed the Baudelaire family immensely.

  <p key="9bdf6c69-f7b8-4d7f-8fa1-bf39f04cd298">
   Sometime after that, the family all stayed inside on one boring, rainy afternoon so they all painted their toenails bright red to pass the time. Violet spilled some polish onto the yellow chair, leaving a stain that never really came off.
   At some point, the children watched a horror film one night. As a result, they spent the rest of it being terrified that every noise they heard were vampires breaking into the house with the intent to kidnap them - however, Klaus later hypothesizes that perhaps someone had broken into the house after all, though he did not state anything to back up his claim.

  <p key="73cadcf0-f020-4f36-84d5-c1b2b8d15f34">
   Later on, the family once had a picnic at the
   Rutabaga River
   , for which Bertrand was so excited that he forgot to pack silverware. This forced everyone to eat sweet-and-sour shrimp with their bare hands and wash them in the river. Violet would then use this outing as an opportunity to find a place for a fishing rod she had invented.
   The children also went to the
   Hotel Preludio
   with their parents for a weekend, where

   taught them an elevator prank; to press all the buttons right before exiting, so everyone who were left inside would end up going to every floor whether they liked it or not.

   Whenever their parents went out to the orchestra, Violet,
   Klaus
   , and
   Sunny
   had a routine that they followed. First, Violet and

   ripped up old newspapers for her own amusement. Then the children would read in the library until they fell asleep on the sofas.
   The events described would later be fond memories that the children looked back on to get them through somber moments or discover solutions that would allow them to escape life-threatening situations.

   to fix it up, Mr. Poe sternly corrects him by stating that the money remains inaccessible until Violet comes of age. For a second, Violet believes that Olaf may strike the banker out of spite, but instead, he escorts him outside. The children then notice an eye tattooed on Olaf's ankle. This very eye would come to haunt their thoughts for years to come.

   Olaf forcibly places the Baudelaire children in one small bedroom with only one worn bed. Violet and Klaus take turns sleeping on it, though they discover that the bed was just as uncomfortable as the floor. Violet designs a bed for Sunny out of the dusty curtains. Unfortunately, it came at the cost of letting the sun stream into the room every morning. Though he isn't around much, Olaf turned out to be an unkind, strict figure. Over the next several days, he left them with a lengthy list of strenuous chore list in addition to lumpy oatmeal for breakfast on a daily basis. The chores are indeed difficult. For example, Violet and her younger siblings had to repaint the back porch and repair the windows, but they did their best. Violet was able to get the chimney cleaned and the windows fixed due to her inventive interests.
  </p>
  <p key="5b2e0860-558c-48c3-854c-443ca09d6960">
   One morning, Violet and her siblings stumble across an added chore to their list. It had stated that the children must prepare dinner for all ten members of his troupe, along with a small sum of money for ingredients. None of the children knew how to cook, causing Klaus to become hysterical. Violet comforts him, reassuring him that she also hated living in Olaf's house, but they had to keep their chin up for the time being, as their father would have said. The siblings then searched the kitchen to find a cookbook that contained an easy recipe but are unable to find one. At that moment, Justice Strauss paid a visit to see how the children were settling in. Violet and her siblings took the opportunity to ask if they could borrow a cookbook, much to Strauss's surprise. When she pointed out how unusual Olaf's request was, Violet shrugged off the absurdity by simply stating that Olaf gives them a lot of responsibility. This was because the young inventor was too well-mannered to complain.
  </p>
  <p key="a40f0153-ca9d-4043-b251-559ac4d8c339">
   They followed Justice Strauss to her library and once they entered, they became fascinated by her wide collection of books. Violet requests a mechanical engineering, though she and everyone else agreed that finding a cookbook first should be their number one priority. After searching for half an hour, her brother Klaus found a recipe for
   Pasta Puttanesca
   , leading to Strauss to take the children to the market to shop for ingredients. They were thankfully able to buy what they need and Violet thanked Strauss when they returned to Olaf's mansion. She was unsure if they were expected to return the favor so she offered to help Strauss with chores as recompense, but she politely assured them that it will not be necessary.
  </p>
  <p key="43139c85-4274-4c2d-9967-fb5a170447ae">
   Violet and her siblings prepare the pasta by following the recipe. Violet does her part by roasting the garlic and chopping the anchovies. As they worked together, they began to feel less miserable, allowing them to speak of memories they had of their parents and of Justice Strauss. This joyful moment of reminiscing was short-lived for just as they placed the pudding (for dessert) in the fridge to cool, Olaf barged into the kitchen, infuriated that the children didn't prepare roast beef. He threatened Sunny, holding her up high until his troupe asked for him. As they leave, a

   took Violet's face and told her not to anger Count Olaf, or he "might wreck that pretty little face." Violet shudders and trembles with fear and revulsion, possibly at the thought of Olaf actually doing so.
  </p>
  <p key="4e88f559-3aa8-426f-97b7-aec27ce55ff7">
   Terrified by the thought of angering Olaf a second time, the children carefully serve the dinner they made. While they set the table, Violet finds herself wishing that they'd bought poison at the market as well. When the troupe finished eating their dinner, Olaf told them that they're excused from the troupe's performance in order to clean up and then go straight to their beds. Klaus angrily corrected him by stating that they only have one bed and can't use their fortune to purchase another, causing Olaf to angrily slap him across the cheek. Afterwards, the troupe left the room and Violet gave Klaus a hug to help him feel better, but she and Sunny end up crying with him.

  <p key="ca9133af-4748-4d1f-84ed-59190f7725c6">
   The next morning, Olaf's note instructed the children to chop firewood. As they do so, Violet and Klaus discuss whether they should stay with such a horrible man or take their chances on the streets. They also imagined what they could buy with their parents' fortune if they had it now to pass the time and bring back their sense of optimism. Violet finally decided to go and talk to Mr. Poe, believing that if he is told how horrible they were being treated, he'll take them out of Olaf's custody. They couldn't find a map of the city so they wandered through the banking district until they find

   , meaning he can do what he pleases as their parent. As expected, he also ignored Klaus's bruise because to him, Olaf's treatment was justified. Violet, angry and frustrated, leads her siblings back to the neighborhood, wishing she could invent something that would take them out of there. Instead, the children spent the rest of the afternoon at Justice Strauss's library.
  </p>
  <p key="6907ffb3-9860-4cda-b22b-18d8b5ef7218">
   The children are surprised to find Olaf waiting for them at breakfast the next morning, with raspberries in their oatmeal. Olaf tells them that Poe called him about their meeting and that he wants the three of them to feel at home with him as their father. He tells them that they will participate in his next play, called

   . Klaus and Sunny will be extras, while Violet will play the bride. Violet, who would much rather build the sets, feels horrified at the idea of marrying Count Olaf, even if just for pretend, and tries to get out of it with flattery. Olaf instead strokes Violet on the chin and threateningly tells her that he can order them to participate as their guardian.

   Violet is convinced Olaf is up to something, but they are afraid to directly ask Justice Strauss, as Olaf has also cast her in the play, or Poe, who might call Olaf again. They decide to go to Strauss's library and read up on the law, but after reading boring law books for hours, they find nothing useful, and Violet leaves to help Strauss in the garden until the

   Klaus smuggles out a book on nuptial law, and the next morning awakens Violet in a panic, explaining that Olaf is planning to marry her for real; the only requirements for marriage are that the groom and bride say "I do" and sign the certificate in their own hands in the presence of a judge, and though Violet is underage, she can marry with the permission of her legal guardian- Count Olaf. The two of them decide to get Sunny and tell Poe, but find their sister missing. Olaf then leads them outside and shows that he has dangled Sunny in a birdcage from his tower window, and will drop her unless Violet agrees to marry him. Violet, though terrified, agrees, but ties up her hair while thinking of ways to rescue Sunny.

   Violet uses the curtains, a metal rod, some wire, and some rocks to make a grappling hook, though she cuts her hands in the process. She ties the curtains to the hook with the Devil's Tongue knot in order to make her hook and goes outside to try and throw it into the tower window. She fails several times, with one time resulting in the hook cutting her shoulder and causing it to bleed, but she finally manages to hit something and climbs up the tower. However, when she reaches the top, she finds that her hook caught onto the hook of the Hook-Handed Man, who captures her.

   Her and Klaus are locked in the tower room until the performance, and they try in vain to find something that could help them escape. Violet suggests Molotov cocktails, but they don't have any kerosine or breaking bottles to use as knives, but she's afraid they'd be overpowered. Olaf then arrives to take them to the play, and as they descend the stairs, Violet starts to come up with a plan.
  </p>
  <p key="0818658d-127d-4827-bca2-8ec1158d2fe9">
   Though filled with dread, Violet and Klaus are fascinated by the backstage of the play, but they are taken and forced into costumes. They try (and fail) to convince Justice Strauss to mess up the legal ceremony, and are forced on stage. Violet participates in the ceremony and signs her name on the certificate with her left hand. Olaf then announces his marriage to Violet to the audience of witnesses, and Violet demands he release Sunny. He tells the Hook-Handed Man to bring the infant down to finish her chores, intending to take Violet back "for their wedding night"- however, as soon as she's assured Sunny is safe, Violet announces that the marriage is not legal, as she did not sign with her dominant hand. Strauss agrees with her, and Poe takes custody of the orphans away from Olaf for dangling Sunny out of a window. However, the lights shut off and Olaf escapes and vows to Violet that he will destroy her and her siblings. Though Violet is terrified, she finds the lights and turns them back on, finding Olaf and his troupe gone.

   Violet picks a room with an enormous window overlooking the hedges, hoping it may inspire her while inventing, and she tacks up large pieces of paper on the wall so she can sketch out her ideas should they come to her in the middle of the night.

While they initially refuse to allow him into the house, he threatens them into dragging his suitcases into the house, and once inside, he pulls out a knife and threatens them again. Violet angrily tells him that he will soon be evicted from the house and marches into the Reptile Room with her siblings, where they then collapse in fear. She suggests calling Poe, but Klaus reminds her that he will not listen and instead suggests they run away. She reminds him that Olaf will just find them again. Monty arrives, but before Violet can tell Monty who Stephano is, Olaf takes Klaus outside and threatens him with the knife, so Violet remains silent.

   The Baudelaires spend the next several days miserably at the lumbermill, wondering how Count Olaf will arrive and try to get their fortune. One day, Charles brings them beef jerky for lunch, but before Violet can ask about the eye building, Flacutono orders them to work some more, and trips Klaus, causing him to break his glasses. Charles takes him to the Optometrist office.

   Violet and Sunny are terrified while Klaus is gone, and spend a long time waiting for him outside the dorms. At night, they slip out of the dormitory to find him and run into him in the courtyard. He is quiet and confused, and doesn't remember what happened, and refers to Violet as "sir." Violet is scared but takes him back to the dorms to get some sleep.

   The next morning, Klaus forgets his shoes, and Violet runs after him, though Phil warns her not to make trouble. They fail to get Klaus to respond to them, and he is put in charge of the stamping machine, accidentally breaking Phil's leg. However, Klaus seems to come back to normal, though he has no memory of the entire day. The Foreman trips him again, causing his glasses to break, and this time Violet and Sunny insist on going to Orwell's with him.

   They receive a memo from Sir, saying that they will be given to Shirley if they cause another accident. Violet asks Phil to keep a close eye on Klaus while she and Sunny go to Sir. He does not listen, and Charles is of no help, so they instead go to the library, where Violet pulls out the book on ocular science. She remembers how Klaus goes to the table of contents first, and finds the chapter on Hypnosis and Mind Control, though the book is written very confusingly. She eventually finds out that there is a word that will snap him out of his hypnosis, though she doesn't know what it is.

   In the middle of the night, the sisters hear the lumbermill's saw start working again and they race across the courtyard to find that Flacutono is trying to have a hypnotized Klaus push Charles, tied to a log, into a saw, in order to make Sir abandon them. Violet figures out that the word that makes Klaus obey is "lucky", and fights with Flacutono as she orders Klaus to push the log away from the saw. Orwell arrives with

He breaks from his trance, and while Violet is held back by Shirley and Flacutono, he manages to invent something to pull the log out of the saw's path. Sir barges into the room, and in shock, Orwell falls into the saw.

   Traumatized by the sight of Orwell being cut up by the saw, the children are silent as Sir and Poe argue, and Sir reveals that he's relinquishing guardianship. Shirley and Flacutono pretend to have been hypnotized, but Poe soon realizes Shirley has an eye tattoo. Olaf and Flacutono (the Bald Man) escape out the window. As Poe and Sir call the police, Phil reminds the Baudelaires that they are lucky to still be alive, to which they reluctantly agree.

At the lawn, Genghis makes them paint a huge circle on the run, and then run laps around it all night. The next several nights, he continues to make them run laps all night, which makes the Baudelaires incredibly tired and frustrated, causing them to flunk their tests in class. Nero informs them that they will be given comprehensive exams, and if they flunk, they will be sent to Genghis for homeschooling. Though Violet snaps and they finally admit they know Genghis is Olaf, Nero doesn't listen to them and sends them away.

While Jerome takes them out in the mornings to their favorite places in town- for Violet, the Verne Invention Museum- in the afternoons they have to return to the large, confusing penthouse and find their way around themselves, usually getting lost.

Jerome points out that he may be heading down the stairs, and they are allowed up. However, they do not run into Gunther, though Esmé claims he left.

   The next morning, Violet ties her hair up and sits at her workbench in hopes of thinking of a plan. She and her siblings are eventually left alone in the penthouse, which they search for Gunther to see if he is hiding there. After failing to find him, they listen to the doors of other apartments, but still to no avail. When they reach the lobby, the Doorman again refuses to let them up, as he never saw Gunther leave, but something he says seems to interest Klaus.

   The children eat in the lobby until Esmé and Jerome arrive and Esmé insists they all be allowed up. After being allowed to go to bed, Violet asks Klaus about what he's thinking of, and he asks her about elevators. She recalls how they work, and he informs her that there are two elevator doors outside their penthouse, but only one outside all other apartments- meaning that one of the elevators is likely ersatz. They believe Gunther may be hiding there, and so they sneak out and investigate, indeed finding only an empty shaft.

   Feeling that they don't have time to argue with the Squalors, Violet instead instructs her siblings to help her build a rope. After doing so, they climb down the shaft and find the Quagmires, traumatized and locked in a cage. They explain that Gunther is going to smuggle them out in an item at the In Auction, and Violet and her siblings climb up to get something to melt the bars with. However, when they return with her fire tongs, the Quagmires are gone. Violet is distraught that they left their friends alone for so long.

They explain to Esmé, who agrees to help them, taking them to the stairwell to go down and call the police. However, she then turns on them and throws them down the elevator shaft, where they land in a net. She announces that she's in on Olaf's plan and that she wants to steal from them the way Beatrice stole from her, before leaving.

   Sunny climbs up the shaft and manages to return with a rope that Violet uses to help them climb to the bottom of the shaft without falling.

Upon hearing that Isadora is a poet, he provides the children with a couplet he found on the ground that they recognize as Isadora's, though they cannot figure out the message. The children quietly wonder if Hector is working for Count Olaf before they decide he wouldn't have shown the poem if he was. Hector informs them that the paper was tangled in the branches of the Nevermore Tree, so the children conclude that the Quagmires may be there.

The children step away and discuss their options- they don't think they'll be able to find help, and though Violet doesn't know if Madame Lulu is truly a fortune teller, she seemingly was able to help Olaf find them every time he asked, so they decide to stay and find out if one of their parents is alive.

   Violet comes up with the idea to disguise themselves with outfits from Olaf's trunk, hoping to obtain answers if they can stay at the carnival. As Madame Lulu mentioned needing more freaks at the House of Freaks, Violet and Klaus disguise themselves as
   Beverly and Elliot, The Two-Headed Freak

   The next morning, the Hook-Handed Man awakens them and lets slip that Lulu told Olaf that one of the Baudelaire parents is alive. Though the Baudelaires are excited, they still don't know if Lulu is truly a fortune teller and decide to sneak into her tent. Firstly, they have to perform, and they approach the House of Freaks. The Hook-Handed Man has a
   Tagliatelle Grande
   to whip them with if they don't obey and introduces the freakshow.

  <p key="e449a0d5-c95d-47fd-ae2d-c02caae093b5">
   The Baudelaires have a horrible experience, and afterward, in their caravan, they try to convince their coworkers that they could have a better life, but they don't listen. Violet is impressed when Hugo informs her that Sunny has helped him with the hot chocolate recipe, and is happy her sister is taking an interest in cooking. They begin to go outside when they hear Olaf's car approach; they then see him and Lulu bringing back a cage of starving lions. He announces that for their new attraction, one of the freaks will be fed to the lions.

  <p key="2bf50e9e-5e86-4cac-a799-60a48032a7d7">
   Olaf describes to Esmé how the fortune-telling happens, and then informs the freaks that they should be grateful for the opportunity to give people what they want. He and his associates leave to dig a pit, and the Baudelaires decide to enter Lulu's tent; Violet is suspicious of Olaf's claim that there was lighting inside a tent, as she had studied electricity. However, she stops when she sees that Klaus is crying over the possibility that one of their parents is alive, and she leans over to comfort him. Klaus asks why they wouldn't be trying to find them, and Violet assures him that maybe they are, and have just had horrible luck.

   They go to Lulu's tent and realize that the Eye printed outside- the same as Olaf's tattoo- is actually an acronym-

   . They enter her tent, and Violet goes to the wall switches, as Olaf said they began by turning off the lights. She then finds her ribbon in their costumed pair of pants, realizing Olaf must have stolen it, and ties her hair up, trying to figure out what the switches do. She notices some sort of invention in the tent, and quickly figures it out; there is a hole that faces the direction of the sunrise, meaning that light would shine in during the early morning, reflecting onto mirrors controlled by the other switch, causing the illusion of lightning. She concludes that Lulu is a fake, but they still need to figure out how she receives her information. Sunny finds a library underneath the table that holds Lulu's crystal ball, containing scraps of information she uses to pretend to tell fortunes.
  </p>
  <p key="c487181d-57db-4f8f-8d20-fb1ce7a8ad5b">
   Violet suggests they stuff their pockets with some of the library's items, or at least try to take whatever has their names on it. They accidentally knock over the crystal ball, causing it to break on the ground. Lulu arrives, angry, but the children confront her about her duplicity and are surprised to see her break down. She admits that her name is Olivia, and she only wants to give people what they want, so she does whatever anyone asks. She discovers the Baudelaires' disguises, and she admits that while she doesn't know for sure if there is a survivor of the fire if there was, they'd be headed towards the

   . She also explains to them that VFD used to be simple and quiet, though she was only told that and doesn't know for sure- there was a schism, a fight between the members, and since then she's fallen into assisting everyone. The Baudelaires offer to leave with her, and Violet decides to rebuild an engine for the rollercoaster carts to escape using part of Olivia's invention. Olivia tells them not to put the invention together until the morning, as Olaf will want a session with the crystal ball to find out where the Baudelaires are. When the Baudelaires ask her if she will tell Olaf where they are, she does not convincingly answer.

   Back at the freaks' caravan, Esmé visits and gives them all gifts, which win over the friendship-starved coworkers. She then requests that the next day, instead of leaping into a pit of lions, the freak selected should push Lulu instead, and then Olaf will let them join his troupe. The Baudelaires are horrified and unconvinced, but their coworkers quickly agree. As soon as the others are asleep, the children sneak out and Violet quickly gets to work repairing the rollercoaster cart, as the children discuss the possibility of a surviving parent. While she manages to complete most of her repairs, she still needs Lulu's fan belt. However, when they reach the carnival, Olaf informs them that he has finished his session with Lulu and that the Lion Feeding is to begin.
  </p>
  <p key="83ca3eb6-b0d9-409b-a86d-2ceca63bac0c">
   Lulu slips the fan belt to Violet, but she still forces them to the lion pit, where Olaf picks "Beverly and Elliot" as the lions' meal. Violet and Klaus try to stall, asking to be pushed into the pit, eventually trying to press Olaf to do it, though he claims to be allergic to cats. Esmé and Olaf press Lulu to do it, and Lulu, desperate to give the people what they want, takes the fan belt from Violet and prepares to push them. However, the angry crowd is impatient, and several people argue over who will push the freaks into the pit. A mob begins, and the Baudelaires escape as Olivia and the Bald Man fall into the pit and are devoured by lions.
  </p>
  <p key="7341a43a-d311-4619-b2f2-6483387721e3">
   The Baudelaires run to Lulu's tent to try and find something to finish the invention. They find a map of the

   and deduce that a stain is an encoded mark of the headquarters' location. However, Olaf and Esmé arrive, and he tells them that he will let them join his troupe if they help him set the carnival on fire. He also discovers the map and the Headquarters' location, and then he and Esmé capture Sunny and leave. Desperate to be reunited with their sister and get to the Mountains, Violet and Klaus burn the tent.
  </p>
  <p key="e142d3c1-3e7a-46f1-9021-ee90a7891141">
   Violet nervously helps the troupe tie the freaks' caravan to Olaf's car and Olaf orders that the two of them sit in there instead of the car, where there will be no room. They sit and think in the caravan until Olaf calls them on a walkie-talkie. He then triumphantly informs them that Lulu told him they were the Baudelaires and has their former coworkers cut the connecting rope to kill them so he can use Sunny to obtain the fortune. Violet and Klaus, terrified, begin to fall down the slope.

They follow him outside, where he explains that, though skeptical of current VFD and a bit bitter about being kept in shadow, Dewey aspires to turn VFD into what he believes it was before- a public library, that all could access. He also explains that they have hidden evidence of all the treachery in the world in his own secret library- under the pond of the Hotel Denouement. He asks the Baudelaires to join him in his library and let it become their permanent home, and asks that Violet "improve on the aquatic design of the catalog." When the children fear they are not noble after all they've done to survive, Dewey assures them that they are noble enough.

Olaf then takes the harpoon gun from Carmelita- in the process breaking up with Esmé, who is very protective over the spoiled girl- and points it at Dewey, demanding to know where the Sugar Bowl is. Though Dewey gives him the three passwords to unlock the laundry room- a medical condition all three Baudelaire children share, the weapon that left Olaf an orphan, and the unfathomable question in the best-known novel by Richard Wright- the sugar bowl will not be in the laundry room, as the lock is a decoy.

He threatens to shoot them, too, but they slowly approach him as he counts down, putting their hands out for the weapon, telling him that it is not his destiny to do such a treacherous deed. Just then, Mr. Poe enters the lobby, surprising Olaf. Olaf thrusts the gun into the hands of the Baudelaires, who drop it, and the harpoon shoots off and kills Dewey. He stumbles back into the pond, and the Baudelaires follow, only in time to see him insist that they did not fail him, and then whisper Kit's name before falling into the water.

Violet confusedly describes her occupation as "Volunteer," and then the children decide that they are comparatively innocent.

The other members of the High Court tell them to ignore it, and they recognize the voices of the Man with a Beard but no Hair and the Woman with Hair but no Beard. They rip off their blindfolds and try to rescue Strauss, who is being kidnapped by Olaf. They ask for everyone to help, but the crowd argues over whether or not they should believe the Baudelaires or risk being found in contempt of court. The Baudelaires, once again alone, follow Olaf and Strauss into the elevator. Olaf goes to the basement, saying he will take the Sugar Bowl. Klaus helps him unlock the door, as he has realized Dewey was right and the Sugar Bowl is not there; however, while doing so, they find out that the weapon that orphaned Olaf was poison darts.

   Angered at not finding the Sugar Bowl, Olaf says he plans to go to the roof to get the Medusoid Mycelium and then release it on the hotel, before escaping off the boat he has on the rooftop pool. Violet agrees to help him get off the roof and survive with a drag chute if he takes them with him, as they need to leave the hotel without authorities spotting them. They gather sheets from the laundry room, and then Sunny shocks her siblings by requesting they set the hotel on fire- which she reveals to them is her plan to signal Kit that the hotel is not safe.

   Upon re-entering the elevator, the Baudelaires play the prank their father taught them and press every button, which will stall them enough that Olaf will not be able to release the Mycelium and will also give them the ability to warn guests of the fire. They try their best, though they are not sure who believes them and who does not on each floor. They reach the roof, and the Baudelaires calmly tie the drag chute to the boat while Olaf fetches the diving helmet containing the spores, before getting in the boat. Justice Strauss pleads with them to go back to the authorities with her, but the Baudelaires do not believe that they will be treated justly, and thus leave Justice Strauss on the burning roof. They make it into the ocean, and as Olaf declares himself captain, the children begin to row into the unknown.

Olaf was before disguised as Kit Snicket who is pregnant and put the helmet (formerly Sunny's in book #11) which contains the poisonous mushrooms, as his false baby. Ishmael fires the harpoon gun at Olaf's "belly" and everyone except Ishmael himself gets poisoned by the Medusoid Mycelium.

   Violet and Klaus think of a plan while Sunny looks around to help her siblings think of one. All three of them know why there are bitter apples on the apple tree: they contain horseradish. They each take a bite of an apple and try to get all the islanders to eat them. Unfortunately, the Islanders are almost out of sight in a boat.

The Baudelaires bury them at the shores of the island and have adopted little Beatrice. They spend the next year cataloging the items from the arboretum and filling in the commonplace book left by their parents. At the end of the bonus mini-book, Chapter 14, the Baudelaires and Beatrice leave the island.

   While Violet's physical traits are never explicitly described, she is consistently illustrated as fairly tall and slim. She is about a head taller than Klaus, has black hair reaching her shoulders and cut in bangs at the front. Her eye color is indeterminable but is known to be different from Klaus's. Her eyes also seem to be fairly small in comparison to other characters. She is often drawn with rosy cheeks.
