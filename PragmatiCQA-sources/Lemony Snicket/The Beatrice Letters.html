   The book contains twelve punch-out letters (of the alphabet, as opposed to correspondence, although the ambiguity is intentional), and each is mentioned in different, interesting ways. An example is that the first letter is an E, juxtaposed against a card from Snicket to Beatrice, in which a map Snicket had drawn forms an E. The punch-out cardstock letters appear to be an anagram of "Beatrice Sank," but they may also be arranged to spell "A Brae Snicket," and "Bear a Snicket."

He was eleven years old when he wrote the message on the card, which he noted on the card himself. The card is labeled "Lemony Snicket, Student of Rhetoric." The punch-out letter accompanying this letter is an 'E,' because there is a map that resembles an 'E' drawn on the card, presumably so that Beatrice can find the cafe to meet Lemony.

The punch-out letter accompanying this letter is an 'E,' like the first one, because in the margins, an 'E' has been scribbled, presumably by Lemony trying to figure out if the letter was forged by "some villain or other." (E. is the V.F.D. initial given to

    (Lemony Snicket to Beatrice Baudelaire #2) In the third letter, written in the Year of the Snake, Lemony is contacting Beatrice because he misses her. Several things are revealed here: that V.F.D had a code class, and that Lemony attends this class with O. It can be assumed that this "O." is

    , as O. is referred to as a male and is described as "nothing but an annoyance," and as being "one eye-browed." This letter shows that Olaf's villainous nature began to form in his early age. It is also established in this letter that "Baticeer" is an anagram for "Beatrice," and that Beatrice once specialized in bat-training at the school. The punch-out letter accompanying this letter is an 'N,' for a doodle drawn on the letter which is supposed to represent a mountain, as in the letter he mentions that there is a climbing class of some sort that they will attend.

The letter states that she will follow a map that had been marked by Lemony in his office, to find his location and inquire about the whereabouts of her lost family.

    is an untrustworthy source of information, because although Lemony is an "assistant obituary spell-checker," he is not allowed to correct the headline which reads "Duchess of Winnipeg is Deaf." He also predicts that J. will be transferred to the Financial Times, which means that G., that foolish girl, will become the new fashion editor, which means that Lemony will probably be given the position of dramatic critic. While it is too difficult to determine what the 'J.' stands for, it is most likely

    , who is revealed in the book series to be a big fan of Esmé Squalor's "fashionable" outfits. The punch-out letter accompanying this letter is an 'I,' representing Beatrice's hatpin that she dropped off of the stage after her bows after a Friday performance of "My Silence Knot," signaling to Lemony that she would meet him later, as per usual.

    (Beatrice Baudelaire II to Lemony Snicket #3) In the sixth letter, written at 4 p.m., Beatrice is writing to Lemony from a cave in which he stayed as a "brae-man." She ended up trading the
    R. Ring
    to a group of shepherds for a yak ride to the cave. The only thing left in the cave was the sheet of paper on which Beatrice wrote the letter. The punch-out letter accompanying this letter is a 'K,' which was written, by Lemony, in the corner of the paper.

    (Lemony Snicket to Beatrice Baudelaire #4) In the seventh letter, written two weeks after his previous letter, Lemony is writing to tell Beatrice that he misses her terribly. Lemony mentions that he "cannot bring [himself] to argue with E. or G., and in the afternoons [he] cannot remember to call L. 'O' or to call O. 'L.'" We can assume this E. is Eleanora Poe, as she works with Lemony and he is speaking of his work. G. has already been established as Geraldine Julienne. The O. that preferred to be called "L" refers to

    (Beatrice Baudelaire to Lemony Snicket #4) In the eighth letter, written on Victoria Day Eve, Beatrice is writing from a secretarial school, specifically a Business Letter Writing Class, taught by the same instructor that Lemony took his code writing class with. (She describes the same flat-footed instructor that Lemony did.) Beatrice continues, saying that she followed Lemony to the library, where he stood for nearly an hour staring into a glass case containing old documents on display for the "Staged Poetry: Sonnets by Actors and Actresses"' exhibit, which is where Beatrice Baudelaire's sonnet "My Silence Knot" was once located. In the letter to the editor at the end of the book, however, Lemony makes it clear that it is no longer there, having been refiled under Beatrice Baudelaire's name. The punch-out letter accompanying this letter is an 'A,' for the A that Beatrice Baudelaire II received on her assignment for submitting her correspondence in the form of a business letter.

    (Lemony Snicket to Beatrice Beatrice #5) In the ninth letter, written at dusk, Lemony addresses Beatrice in anguish. Although Beatrice originally accepted his marriage proposal, she later wrote him a 200 page book telling him why she could not marry him after all. Lemony attempts, in his letter, to answer the thirteen questions she posed on page 189. Within the letter, Lemony makes use of

    , asking "Are you certain your co-star is one of us?" It would be assumed that this is referring to Olaf, but later in the letter he is disqualified from this possibility when Lemony writes, "I will love you if you marry someone else--your co-star, perhaps, or Y., or even O., or anyone Z. through A., even R." The punch-out letter accompanying this letter is a 'C,' for the shape created by a lock of Beatrice's hair that Lemony returned to Beatrice with his letter.

    (Beatrice Baudelaire II to Lemony Snicket #5) The tenth letter, written "Midway through the Days of Awe," was written by Beatrice in her office in the Rhetorical Building. She is once again begging for Lemony's attention so that they can solve the mysteries of the Baudelaire orphans together. The punch-out letter accompanying this letter is a "T," representing the shape of a tool that Beatrice used to drill a hole in the floor of her office, to slip her letter through to Lemony's office.

    (Beatrice Baudelaire to Lemony Snicket #6) The twelfth letter, written at cocktail time, is on a card the same size as the very first message that Lemony sent to Beatrice. It is labeled "Beatrice Baudelaire, Baticeer Extraordinaire, The Rhetorical Building 14th Floor." This card holds only a short message, reminiscent of Lemony's first letter to Beatrice Baudelaire. After apologizing for embarrassing him, Beatrice asks Lemony to meet with her, as she was in the same restaurant as he was. There is no evidence of whether or not Lemony accepted or rejected the message, but the fact that it wasn't ripped in half (as Beatrice asked Lemony to do if he didn't want to meet her) may be proof that they did meet. The punch-out letter accompanying this message is a 'B', as Beatrice signed the message "B." rather than "Beatrice Baudelaire."

    The thirteenth letter, written "Today," is from Lemony to his editor, in which he explains the difficulty of trying to find the sonnet entitled "My Silence Knot." He also explains the difficulty of having to endure the memories associated with these letters by trying to put them in the right order. He does not sign this letter, like he usually does, and so it is actually considered the final note of the series.

   "Brae" comes from the northern English/Scottish brēaw, which meant eyebrow or eyelid, which in itself could be referring to the hairs on Count Olaf's very flagrant dome of a head. It could also refer to the eye tattoo of VFD on Olaf's ankle. Brae also means declivity or hillside slope. While the questions Beatrice asks Lemony in her 200-page answer are unknown, Lemony answers Question Six with "A man who lives in the hills". Beatrice persumably asked for the definition of a brae man, which is how a man (persumably Olaf) is referred to in his prior letter.
