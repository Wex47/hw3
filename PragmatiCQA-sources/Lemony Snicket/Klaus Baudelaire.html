   Sometimes, Bertrand would appear into Klaus's room in the mornings to wake him up and find him asleep with a book in one hand and a flashlight in the other; sometimes he would come at night, and when Klaus asked about the inexplicable noises outside his window, Bertrand and Beatrice insisted it was nothing more than the wind, even on windless evenings.

   Klaus used a stepladder to take an atlas from a high shelf, where his parents kept several books they wanted to keep secret.

While relieved, their parents told their children that if they got lost again, to stay put and let their parents find them.

   On Beatrice's birthday, the family awoke early to make her a cake, and Klaus sifted through the flour with the cinnamon, pausing every few minutes to wipe his glasses.

   The family once had a picnic at the Rutabaga River, and Bertrand was so excited that he forgot to pack silverware, and the family had to eat sweet-and-sour shrimp with their hands, and wash their hands in the river; afterward, Klaus and Beatrice picked blackberries.

Then, after seeing the movie "Zombies in the Snow", Stephano uses poison from a venomous snake, the Mamba du Mal, to murder Uncle Monty, blaming it on the snake. While Violet tried to find evidence Stephano murdered Uncle Monty, Klaus used the books in the library to do some research, and found out that the Mamba du Mal killed its victims by strangling them. With that and the evidence Violet found in Stephano's case, they were able to prove Uncle Monty was murdered by Stephano. Unfortunately, Olaf managed to escape, and when Poe tried to call the police, it was already too late.

He has a bow tie, which, like Violet's hair ribbon, often varies with its color, although red seems to be the most common color for it. He along with the rest of his siblings were said to be pleasant-looking, so he may be viewed as handsome.

Unlike the books, he is only briefly seen with glasses, when he is reading at the beginning of the film and in the Reptile Room- as thus, they are likely reading glasses and thus not for everyday use.

Early knives have been found in Egyptian tombs and Mayan temples, where they were used for ceremonial purposes, and mostly fashioned out of stone. Gradually bronze and iron became the essential materials in knives, although some cultures fashioned them out of the incisors of slain animals. There are a number of different types of knives, including the pocket- knife, the penknife, and the drawing knife, but the one required for this craniectomy is a Bowie knife, named after Colonel James Bowie, who lived in Texas."

     "Before I make the first incision, I would like to say a few words concerning rust. Rust is a reddish-brown coating that forms on certain metals when they oxidize, which is a scientific term for a chemical reaction occurring when iron or steel comes into contact with moisture. The oxidation process is integral to a craniectomy due to the oxidative processes of cellular mitochondria and cosmetic demystification."

Harry is very popular and has many friends and supportive figures at Hogwarts, while Klaus had an overwhelmingly horrible time at Prufrock, only having four people for support (his sisters and the Quagmires).

      Liam Aiken, who portrays Klaus in the film, was almost cast as Harry Potter, but Rowling insisted on having a British cast.
      For his role in the movies, Daniel Radcliffe received around £74 million, meaning this was a lost fortune for Liam. The Lemony Snicket film sequels were dropped due to Paramount's corporate shakeups, in addition to the unnaturalness of recasting the same child actors in a film series not shot back-to-back when
