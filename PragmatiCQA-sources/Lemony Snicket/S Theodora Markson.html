  <p key="6f4791be-3ed9-4b65-b38e-ef9eca525413">
   Theodora has a very clear surface personality of a brash, arrogant woman. She is endlessly and incredibly stubborn, and once she has set her mind on something she refuses to be swayed, only hesitantly changing her mind should the evidence become as clear as possible to other adults around her, such as when the Officers Mitchum accept Snicket and Ellington Feint's story about the statue.
   What also clashes with her stubbornness is her incompetence; she is an incredibly bad detective, as she very quickly jumps to conclusions and then sticks by them, no matter how insane they sound, such as deciding that thieves broke into the

   through the ceiling. Adding to this, she is also very gullible to and easily swayed by other adults she considers her equals or superiors, such as

   .
   She's also horrible at keeping secrets, though she thinks she's better than she is.
   She also can appear incredibly rude at times, such as being dismissive of

   and then admiring Knight's clothing instead of searching for clues.
  </p>
  <p key="afa17c6b-2307-4d22-a13f-a1070c1309b2">
   However, beneath this exterior, there does appear to be more to Theodora. She is very emotional when under stress, which seems to be something she dislikes, as she orders Snicket to leave when she begins crying,
   and breaks down to the point of going nonverbal upon witnessing a murder.
   She also seems desperate for positive attention, leading to her very quickly falling in with Sharon Haines and becoming incredibly distraught upon Sharon's betrayal, and her idolization of her previous apprentice, who seems to have made her happy. She also becomes angry and distraught upon being told about how her incompetence is viewed.
   She very much wants to be considered a good volunteer, and is desperate to get a good evaluation so she could be ranked higher on the list of chaperones.

   , is incredibly strained. She believes her role as mentor is expressly and specifically to be able to give him orders and have him obey so that he can watch her and learn from her example. However, Snicket clearly dislikes this arrangement, and often angers her by talking back and directly disobeying orders. What seems to upset her more is that his defiance tends to be due to him noticing something she refuses to see, and then solving the case instead of her. While she does begrudgingly accept that he is very intelligent, she also still treats him simultaneously as if he's younger than he is (telling him to "go play with" other children
   and condescendingly explaining the meaning of words, a tick he picked up from her), as well as more independant than he could be at that age (leaving him alone for several days unattended, for example
   .) She has been noted to almost hit him at least once, when he revealed just how badly VFD viewed her, though she refrained and has not shown violent tendencies afterwards.
   She also is dismissive of children over all, such as constantly forgetting

  </p>
  <p key="da3bc9bb-29e3-4c06-b6c7-a07166d5dd9d">
   Despite this, she does have a level of caring for her apprentice; she is noted to have made sure he would be looked after should something happen to her,
   and seems to have stood up to

   ; however, considering that she was ranked dead last in the list of chaperones following Bertrand's departure, it's possible that their relationship was not as good as she believed it to be.
  </p>
  <p key="ff4bdafe-08ca-4ba1-999d-25ce74254dae">
   She also displays two iconic characteristics, the first being her incredibly wild and bushy hair. It is said by Snicket to be the stuff of a hairbrush's nightmares, and indeed at one point she is noted to go through at least three brushes in attempt to comb through it.
   It is a point of hilarity for Snicket and several of his associates,
   and described by Snicket as a mystery he was never able to solve, though his main suspect is her driving helmet, which leads to her second iconography, her green roadster. It is said to have "seen better days" and doesn't seem to be in great shape. While driving, Theodora insists upon wearing a helmet, which sometimes covers her ears and causes an inability to hear properly.

   picked S. Theodora Markson to be his chaperone due to her closeness to the city, where he planned to rob a museum with his sister,

   , which was far enough away from the city that Snicket would not be able to help his sister. Because he wouldn't know this until the last minute, and he'd be leaving his suitcase at the train station, Theodora bought clothes for him.
   Lemony also chose the chaperone ranked 52nd out of 52, because he thought he would be able to do more by himself with his associates.

Theodora enters the shop and drops a message on Snicket's lap, telling him to climb out the bathroom window and meet her in the green roadster in the alley in five minutes.

   Snicket manages to do this, but she decides not to read his letter of introduction and informs him that due to a complicated change of plans, they will have to hurry away. When Snicket backtalks her, she tells him to get out of her car, and only allows him to stay when he apologies and agrees that he wants her to be his chaperone. She introduces herself, though she does not tell him what the S in her name stands for, and also tells him that her main methods of teaching are "example" and "nagging." She then reveals that she stole his tea, and dumps it out the window to show an eerie cloud of steam rise from it. She tells him that Gifford and Ghede had slipped laudanum into his tea, before driving away.

   Theodora drives her apprentice to Stain'd-by-the-Sea, where they have been hired for a case. She explains what she knows of the town's history to Snicket as they drive on a road of seashells. A bell rings from Offshore Island, and Theodora orders Snicket to give her a mask and put one on himself, believing the bell to be a warning against water pressure, which the masks will help them breathe through.

Murphy Sallis says she suspects the Mallahan family, but that she doesn't want any trouble to come to them. She makes Theodora and Snicket promise to return the statue to its rightful owners and to be discreet about her identity.
