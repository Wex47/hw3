The Baudelaires meet either Frank or Ernest who states that they are short-handed and must figure out the hotel system. He informs them that they are to answer to the summons of the hotel guests. One bellboy appears telling Frank or Ernest that a taxi driver dropped off some luggage where he said that the guests will not arrive until Thursday. Frank or Ernest left with the bellboy to take care of the situation leaving the Baudelaires near a large wooden bench.

After a discussion of them growing up, the Baudelaires are encountered by either Frank or Ernest as they ask how the hotel is organized. Frank or Ernest explains that the Hotel Denouement is organized by the Dewey decimal system similar to the way that books are organized in many libraries where he uses Room 831 where German poets are gathered as an example and even a description of the social sciences as well as the bells that ring being associated with each room.

Justice Strauss has been communicating with the High Court on helping the Baudelaires, and Jerome - who also felt bad about how he abandoned the orphans - has written a book on the matter. The High Court justices are coming to put Count Olaf and the other evil people of V.F.D. on trial and so - on Thursday - all of the noble people will arrive to give evidence.

   Mr. Poe escorts the Baudelaire children to the far corner of the lobby where Frank or Ernest was standing next to the door that is marked 121. Justice Strauss breaks it up by saying to the assembled people that their decision for the their guilt or innocence is not for them to decide on as this is the matter of the High Court. As Justice Strauss states that the authorities have been notified while the other judges from the High Court are on their way, she states that they will begin the trial in a matter of hours. A woman in a nightgown with dancing clowns on it thought that the trial will be on Thursday. Justice Strauss claims that showing up early is the sign of a noble person where she and the other noble judges will decide on this matter and the other matters once and for all. Justice Strauss did give the Baudelaire children a gentle smile while the Baudelaires smiled back.

Frank or Ernest unlocked the door which showed the closet where Violet found the harpoon gun. The murmuring crowd then parted to reveal Count Olaf who walked towards the Baudelaires where he claims that they should be locked up to keep treacherous people from wandering the hotel which Colette and Kevin agreed on. Justice Strauss tells Count Olaf that he has also been accused of a great deal of treachery and that the high court is very interested in his case as well where Count Olaf will be locked in Room 165 until the trial begins. Count Olaf reluctantly agreed to Justice Strauss' suggestion as Frank or Ernest took Count Olaf's arm and escorted him to Room 165. As the Baudelaire children go into Room 121, Jerome and Justice Strauss gave them a little wave and Mr. Poe gave them a cough while Frank or Ernest closed the door to Room 121.

   It is early Wednesday morning when the Baudelaires go to sleep, and they wake in the afternoon where they are returned to the lobby for the trial by Frank and Ernest. Due to a literal reading of the phrase "justice is blind", everyone except the judges is blindfolded. Even Frank and Ernest are blindfolded. The blindfolded people had a hard time finding their seats where even Charles had a hard time finding Sir. Anyone who peaks will be found guilty of contempt of court. The trial begins and Justice Strauss states that they had to the trial today instead of Thursday in light of the death of Dewey and that the guilty parties will be handed to the authorities who are waiting outside. Count Olaf and Esmé Squalor state that there will be a cocktail party after the trial to which Justice Strauss states that they are out of order. Olaf gives a brief speech where he states his innocence. The Baudelaires, however, are beginning to question their own nobility and morality and so they answer that they are "comparatively innocent". Justice Strauss then asks for people to submit evidence to the judges as the blindfolded people kept stumbling over another:

When Violet shouts to call the fire department as the elevator doors started to close, they could not tell if it was Frank or Ernest that said "Which one?" While Olaf was angered that the Man With a Beard But No Hair and the Woman With Hair But No Beard had failed him, the Baudelaires were unable to point out that he failed them for trying to double-cross them.
