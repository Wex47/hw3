He tells the other castaways on the island that his feet are injured, and keeps them covered in clay to promote this idea as it supposedly has healing properties, but it turns out that he was lying so that he does not have to do much work on the island. In the TV series, he wears boots made of clay and walks around the islanders sometimes, although he apparently has his own sleigh, implying he has told them that he is partially disabled in this version.

   Ishmael is a very secretive elderly man who dislikes change and uses the "
   appeal to tradition
   " argument, a logical fallacy that supports doing something merely because it's been done for a long time. He does not allow anything to happen on the island that will change the ridiculously arbitrary customs and traditions that he has put in place. For example,
   <a href="Miranda Caliban.html" key="4501eaed-9b72-4383-bfc6-f91b5aae44f0" title="Miranda Caliban">
    Miranda Caliban
   </a>
   has learned the backstroke in secrecy, as he claims it is not the customary way to swim.
  </p>
  <p key="31da4ba8-3ab0-4c9f-93f3-46427aefaff0">
   Ishmael's reluctance for change and new experiences is eventually revealed to have stemmed from his "differences in people cause conflict" mentality, as part of his "safety is more important than free will" opinion. He does not want the islanders to be influenced by anything that comes from the "outside world" beyond the island because he views it as corrupt, treacherous, and dangerous.
  </p>
  <p key="3610bbfe-9009-475d-a5ab-884b99cd3877">
   Ishmael has a compassionate side, as he has been caring for the islanders and welcomes the Baudelaires into his society, as long as they abide by his rules. He was well-intentioned when he was part of V.F.D. His desire to create a peaceful utopia-like society is undeniable.
  </p>
  <p key="2e3fd1a0-55f6-4552-ba25-8bf8f0fec09c">
   Unfortunately, Ishmael also has an rather cruel and selfish side as shown when he willingly endangered the lives of the islanders in order to keep his secrets safe, although Ishmael's goal was to prevent another schism. When Violet called him out for valuing preventing a conflict over preventing their deaths, and also endangering the rest of the world by possibly spreading the fungus to other people, all he replied was, "I guess it depends on how you look at it." He also took a jab at the poor survival skills of the Baudelaire parents as he said farewell to the Baudelaire children before his departure.
  </p>
  <p key="eca870da-a7e3-49ac-bdbc-2cecb76b6cb1">
   The book version of Ishamel is shown to be rather intelligent and philosophical in addition to being more "humanized". Due to the TV series portrayal of Ishmael being forced into an hour, Ishmael comes off as a bit more one-dimensional in this adaptation.

  </p>
  <p key="5c1a44e2-7d79-4411-a5a5-2db6f855b6b0">
   Ishmael began to spread rumors and doubt throughout the island that operating so boisterously would eventually endanger the inhabitants. Beatrice and Bertrand referred to Ishmael's actions as "fear-mongering". Due to frequent outbursts of concern from Ishmael, the construction of a passageway to

  <p key="aa5259c2-05cb-441d-b620-2f45cd0f776c">
   After Ishmael became the island's facilitator, he made everything on the island simple and pressured the same lifestyle for everyone in order to avoid future schisms. For example, the same three bland dishes were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner respectively. Furthermore, he did not allow forks because they could be used as weapons. The other islanders remained submissive when Ishmael insisted that they regularly drink fermented coconut milk, an opiate that keeps them from protesting against his customs. He claimed that teaching the islanders how to read is not a good idea, so those born on the island such as

   After the Baudelaires introduce themselves, Friday suggests a toast to them which her mother, Miranda Caliban, agrees to. Ishmael says, "Let's drink a toast to the Baudelaire orphans!" despite them not mentioning their lost parents, foreshadowing he knows more about them than he's letting on. They call a toast with the coconut cordial which everybody carries, but the Baudelaires dislike it. Ishmael repeatedly keeps offering the cordial to them, despite continuously rejecting it because they think it tastes strange.
​​
The islanders become annoyed with Ishmael's rules and begin to form a mutiny against him. One night, two of the islanders,

A group of discontented islanders plan to begin their mutiny against Ishmael in the morning, and they ask the Baudelaires to go over to the arboretum where all the contraband items are collected and find or make some weapons to use in the rebellion. Further, the mutineers refuse to help Kit unless the Baudelaires help them in return.

   The children agree and set off for the arboretum. There, they discover a well-appointed living area and a well-organized library before they were discovered by Ishmael. They learned that their parents were once the island's facilitators and have made many improvements meant to make life on the island easier and more pleasant, but they were eventually overthrown by Ishmael because he believed that a strictly-enforced simple life (combined with the opiate laced in the coconut cordial) was the best way to avoid conflict.

     "Baudelaires, as your facilitator, allow me to give you a piece of advice, as you begin your stay on this island. Don't rock the boat. We've been living by our customs for quite some time. Most of us can scarcely remember our lives before we became castaways, and there is a whole generation of islanders who have never lived anywhere else. My advice to you is not to ask so many questions or meddle around too much with our customs. We have taken you in, Baudelaires, which is a kindness, and we expect kindness in return. If you keep prying into the affairs of the island, people are going to think you're unkind—just like Friday thought Olaf was unkind. So don't rock the boat. After all, rocking the boat is what got you here in the first place."

    However, this was proven incorrect since the characters were portrayed by two different actors.

    Ishmael has been theorized to be some parody of the stereotypical "God", who is often depicted as an old man sitting in a chair in addition to acting as a protector that enacts rules for people to follow. The thirteenth book depicts Ishmael as having a thick and wild beard. Likewise, many people envision God as having such a beard. The aforementioned deity in the Bible commanded Adam and Eve not to eat the forbidden fruit of knowledge, similar to how Ishmael attempts to keep the islanders nescient by persuading them not to learn how to read, as well as trying to forbid the islanders from eating the horseradish apples. Ishmael is also a Biblical name that means "God will hear" which may allude to his role.

      This symbolism is what compelled the writers of the TV series to desire to make Ishmael the founder of V.F.D. as they wanted to portray him as a "creator", although writer
      Joe Tracz
      regrets omitting a line spoken by Ishmael about how V.F.D. has had different incarnations throughout history. Furthermore, his previous post as the principal of Prufrock is a result of the writers wish to throw some shade at the "good wizard trope" as seen with Albus Dumbledore in

    In the TV series, Ishmael wields a decorated Shepherd's crook. While there are actual sheep on the island, one may interpret it as Ishmael acting as a figurative shepherd for the islanders that behave as such thanks to their herd mentality. Sheep are also mentioned frequently in the Bible, which reinforces the Biblical themes included in
