   Ellington is described by Lemony Snicket as mysterious and deceitful, however with very rare exceptions she is actually quite open about her motivations. She makes it clear throughout her interactions with the

   that her one goal is to rescue her father from the

   </a>
   , and that she will do "anything and everything" in order to succeed in this. She is fiercely loyal to her father and will do anything for him- which is incredibly tragic, due to the fact that her father is Hangfire, faked his own kidnapping, and has been manipulating her for months. Even after his betrayal is revealed, Ellington is devastated at his death and furious with his murderer, and seems to have broken down quite a bit.
  </p>
  <p key="34cf9979-e537-4a08-b9d5-849cad0a26f7">
   She is very resourceful and a bit manipulative in getting what she needs from Lemony- first by quickly wrapping the statue of the

   and then mailing it to herself while pretending to mail it to him, then by stealing the beast from Lemony again at the Mallahan Lighthouse, and then convincing him to give it to her again while in jail. She is very good at planning ahead for different eventualities- she was able to hide the statue from both the Inhumane Society and the Associates until she could get an exclusive audience with Hangfire, and she seems to have planned with to deceive Snicket on the train in order to meet with the villain privately.
  </p>
  <p key="44293b2b-c65d-4e50-b8eb-7f093933d7c1">
   Despite her manipulation, she does seem to legitimately care about Snicket, and even some other members of the Association of Associates, revealing her morality and need for connection. She tells Snicket about

   despite the fact he could use that information against her, tells him everything once she is confronted, searches for root beer floats for him even after they part, and takes large risks to ensure his safety, such as confessing her fraud to the Mitchums in an attempt to get Lemony out of trouble.

   while taking their taxi. And even while working secretly for the Inhumane Society, Ellington jeopardized Hangfire's plans by helping the Associates fight the affects of laudanum, telling them quite a bit of the plan, and hiding Snicket in her room and showing him the beast hidden in the firepond.
  </p>
  <p key="bfabc11c-4935-4589-8917-011564b519da">
   While Ellington tends to hide her feelings, she also has moments where she breaks. These instances are when her overwrought and sentimental side of her personality is shown such as when she showed Snicket her father's music box and later broke down crying about the need to find her father. She also does seem to have a sense of justice, as she admitted to Snicket she was wrong after helping him put out Stew's fire and her subsequent second arrest.

   . He does indeed seem fascinated with her, which could probably imply his alleged romantic interest, though it also likely that he mistakes his excitement about finding what he considers a mystery to unravel around her as such. Ellington does not seem to reciprocate his potential romantic feelings, though she does offhandedly mention blushing when Lemony claims he cannot take his eyes off of her.

   While most characters have a defined special interest or occupation, part of the mystery around Ellington is how hers is never directly mentioned. While she does seem to like coffee quite a bit- which has been speculated to be symbolism for how her father's emotional manipulation and abuse have forced her to grow up too fast, giving her a preference for such a bitter drink
   - she does not seem to have much interest in it outside of the taste and ability to keep her awake. It is far more likely that her special interest is jazz music- even ignoring the fact she is named after
   a Jazz musician

She had not told me the name of the tune. It was a mystery, like what the S stood for in Theodora's name. I kept walking, with nothing but Solitude for company. 'Solitude' is a fancy name for being all by yourself. It's not a bad name, I thought.

Ellington made a plan to help her; she would disguise herself as Cleo Knight and throw people off her trail, while Cleo ran away to Handkerchief Heights to work on her formula. Ellington gave Cleo one of her raspberry-colored berets, while Cleo bought Ellington a coat like hers from Dicey's Department Store and helped her bleach her hair.

Dander took her at her word and kept her in a room, where she brought her scientific equipment, and whenever the nurse went out, Ellington searched the building for her father. By the time Snicket begins investigating Cleo's disappearance, however, Dander had grown impatient and started to threaten her into completing the formula.

Theodora Markson and the Officers Mitchum arrive, and upon hearing the story, Ellington is arrested for fraud. Ellington manages to convince Snicket to leave the Bombinating Beast statue with her in the prison, and he also tells her that once the police leave, that she can pick the lock with a hairpin and escape. She does just that when the officers leave to go to Colophon Clinic, once again disappearing.

But he also says that he has to hide her, as Hangfire believes her to be dead, so they put on masks to obscure their faces. He takes her to the prison car, and she gives him a skeleton key she got from Sharon Haines in order to open it. He makes her a harness out of his belt and tells her to hang outside of the train until he comes to fetch her. She is terrified by this, and Snicket tells her to get scared later, before distracting her by talking about the places they could go, such as Winnipeg. He then lets her dangle outside the train, and finds her terror comforting only in that it proves to him that she wasn't the murderer, as she'd clearly never done something like that before.

But before Hangfire can use it, Snicket steals the statue and uses it to summon the Bombinating Beast. As the beast attacks the train, Hangfire's mask falls off, revealing that he has been Armstrong Feint the entire time. He approaches the beast, and Ellington screams as Snicket pushes him into its mouth, instantly killing him.
