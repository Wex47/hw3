   is an homage to (and at times, a satire of) the
   Noir genre
   , which is defined as a crime fiction subgenre with ambiguous morality and tragically flawed protagonists. The series fits into the genre through its flawed, and sometimes unreliable, narrator, an exploration of corrupt systems, moral quandaries and complex mystery. Several other stories from the genre are referenced throughout the books, with the hunt for the

   The series also offers a deconstruction of the genre; a common trope in noir is that most characters are full of despair and never find a happy ending, and while Snicket's own journey is left ambiguous, several of his associates cling to hope despite the circumstances, determined to one day make their town great again, such as

   also seems to be a deconstruction of the
   femme fatale
   trope; Snicket even refers to her in her official bio as a "personne fatale." After she initially deceives Snicket in an attempt to steal the statue, Snicket continues to see her as a mysterious and cunning adversary, often describing her as a mystery in of herself and, despite wanting to help her, remaining cautious and analyzing her actions as pre-planned and potentially manipulative. However, outside of Snicket's narration, Feint is very open about her motives- her only care is rescuing

   In August 2009, Snicket signed with Egmont Publishing for UK rights to the new series, and in November 2009, Snicket signed with Little, Brown, and Company for North American rights. Although Snicket is no longer working with HarperCollins, Susan Rich is continuing to work as his editor.

   When news first broke of the new series, Snicket told the BBC: "I can neither confirm nor deny that I have begun research into a new case, and I can neither confirm nor deny that the results are as dreadful and unnerving as

   . However I can confirm that Egmont will be publishing these findings."
   Over the past two years, little information has been available about the new series, due to Egmont Publishing's "fear of jeopardising the final stages of Mr. Snicket's investigations," but Leah Thaxton of Egmont did made a statement about the series: "Usually, I look forward to opening my post. It's exciting to think that I might find a manuscript to bring comfort and joy to any reader. But that morning, when I saw the handwriting on the envelope... Well, how would you feel if you knew you were about to unleash yet more untold misery on the unsuspecting children of this country? We at Egmont can't escape Lemony Snicket's grim story but, for the rest of you, there's time. PLEASE READ SOMETHING ELSE!"

   In 2009, Handler revealed that the prequels do "have some overlap with [ASOUE], but it's not a continuation," and that his "new series for older children is about more experiences from [his] own life; it takes place at a time before the Baudelaire children were born." Apparently, the series would be a "highly autobiographical account" of Lemony Snicket's adolescence.
