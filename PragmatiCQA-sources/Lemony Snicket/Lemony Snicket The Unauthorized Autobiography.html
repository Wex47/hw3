   Each chapter in the book included a question. In the book however, Lemony Snicket changed the chapter's titles, saying they were not the "proper questions" for the Baudelaires' case, and wrote in new titles after crossing out the previous names. Regardless, some of the former questions are answered within the chapter itself (such as Chapter 10) or other chapters.

   Next is a letter addressed to "Genius"; someone is gathering information on Dr. Montgomery's reptile collection. He adopted Veiled Facial Disguises and went to a V.F.D Library, where he found a librarian who, unknowingly to him, tried to give him a message. He then read

   He then disguised himself as a cow, including a map of the area he investigated, and first investigated the Cathedral of the Alleged Virgin to see if it looked like the toad. He listened to a gravelly voice to see if it was the Dissonant Toad, but decided it wasn't when the voice muttered about how inconvenient it was to drown someone, because they got all wet. He then sniffed wildflowers, and then observed a black snake attempting to communicate with crickets that he suspects is the Mamba du Mal. He spotted a yellow-striped lizard, and overheard a child claim to see a fat toad with two wings. He approached a couple who owned the

    While it's become difficult for members to contact potential volunteers since the schism, there is a possibility that they have unknowingly received messages. Interested recruits should keep a commonplace book and make notes on events they believe are suspicious, unfortunate, or very dull, and should keep their book in a safe place, such as underneath the bed or at a dairy.

     How does my Volunteering Begin?
    </b>
    The recruit will hear a noise outside their home, such as the howl of a wolf, the cawing of a crow, the hissing of a snake, the chirping of a cricket, the engine of an automobile, the keys of a typewriter, the striking of a match, or the turning of a page. The recruit is to ask their parents what the noise was, an if they reply "nothing", they are to reply, "If there's nothing out there, what was that noise?" That is considered the cue that it is safeÂ for recruitment to begin. NOTE: If the recruit has no parents, they will be contacted in a more direct manner.
