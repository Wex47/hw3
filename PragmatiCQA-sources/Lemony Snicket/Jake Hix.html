Jake's next batch of muffins was pecan, offered on a sliding scale- "free for Lemony Snicket, but not to be sold to Stew Mitchum under any circumstances."

Snicket eventually does arrive, meeting with Jake, Kellar, and Moxie. As Jake cooks, he describes the plot of
   the book he's reading
   to Snicket and Moxie, and Snicket recommends
   The Children's Hour
   . Kellar asks if Jake and Moxie go to school, and then starts talking about Italian limes, and how there are none in Stain'd-by-the-Sea. When Snicket gets confused, Kellar leaves.

   That night, Jake visits Cleo and tells her about the suspicious fires, and about then, Stain'd Secondary is set on fire, and the two sweethearts rush to the scene to see if they can help. When the firefighters, the Talkie Brothers, turn on the hose, however, the water in the hydrant made the flame worse, as it had been sabotaged with a flammable chemical. Jake and Cleo pull the brothers out of the blaze.

   The next morning, Snicket asks them to do another errand for him, which he can't explain; they need to operate under a fragmentary plot. He asks that they throw a wheelbarrow over the wall, and when they go outside, Ornette distracts Stew and Jake, Cleo and Moxie help him toss the wheelbarrow. He also asks them to throw the library's blank books over the wall, where the wheelbarrow is, before he sneaks away.

   The group manages to run off to Hungry's when they arrive in town, and when Snicket meets them there, he's been injured by Stew. Jake fixes them all lunch, and then Snicket tells them to go to Dicey's Department Store, as Hangfire plans to burn it down; this turns out to be a misdirection, as Hangfire sent Stew to burn the library. However, the associates staying at Dicey's keeps him from realizing Snicket realized his deception, and Ellington and Snicket manage to save the library.

   Much later, the associates all meet at Handkerchief Heights for a celebratory dinner that Jake fixed. Snicket explains that they will have to try to not be seen together and operate on fragmentary plots, and the associates end the dinner with a game of Beethoven.

The train stops at Offshore island, and Cleo and Jake sneak aboard the train and find Kellar, Moxie, and Snicket. While getting inside, they see Stew Mitchum let a masked figure into the Officers' Lounge. Snicket tells his associates that Qwerty has been murdered and that his chaperone was framed for the crime.

Snicket says that, Jake can help the town rise again by feeding the hungry, and that he and Cleo are lucky to have found each other. Before he leaves, Snicket sees Jake smiling at something Pip had said. Jake waves goodbye as Snicket leaves the town and goes into the Clusterous Forest.
