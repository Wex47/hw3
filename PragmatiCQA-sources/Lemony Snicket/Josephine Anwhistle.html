   Josephine was traumatized by Ike's death and fell into grief. Ever since his death, Josephine has been immensely terrified of Lake Lachrymose. It felt like she had lost a friend when the lake took away her husband. No longer did she swim in it every day, no longer did she visit its beaches and caves and islands surrounding the lake which she once knew so well. She also developed a myriad of fears and irrational phobias.

   In her house, she prepared a bedroom for them that was neat and clean, and even gave them gifts, though they were gifts the Baudelaires did not like. Violet received a doll named Pretty Penny, Klaus received an electric train and Sunny got a rattle that was, to her dismay, not worth biting. Violet gave the doll to Sunny to bite on, Klaus gave the electric train to Violet to tinker with, which unfortunately left Klaus with a rattle, She also gave them chilled cucumber soup because she was too afraid to use the stove, as she was afraid it could explode, set the house on fire and kill them.

   As she gave her new charges a tour of her home, she explained why each and everything is terribly dangerous. Klaus asked why there are cans in every room, and Josephine replied that they are for burglars. If burglars tripped over the can it would create sound to wake everyone up. She explained that doorknobs can shatter into a million pieces and hit one's eye, doormats can cause one to trip and break one's neck, the stove can burst into flames, and the telephone can electrocute someone. Her fears ranged from burglary to realtors. Understandably, the Baudelaire orphans were surprised to find out that a woman so afraid of everything in sight could bear to live in a house that is literally clinging to the side of a cliff, hanging over Lake Lachrymose, even including a large window that looked out onto the lake where her beloved husband died.

He charmed and flattered her so she wouldn't listen to the Baudelaires warnings and later, Aunt Josephine received a telephone call, but as she was afraid of the phone, Violet offered to answer it. Realizing the caller is none other than Captain Sham, Violet quickly pretended that it's a wrong number from the Hopalong Dancing School. When Captain Sham called again, Violet offered to answer the phone again, but her aunt was impressed by Violet's bravery and picked it up instead. Delighted to speak with someone she believed to be so charming, she told the children to go upstairs so they couldn't eavesdrop on the surprise he had planned for them. Though they attempt to refuse, their guardian insisted and they uneasily headed to their bedroom.

   They immediately knew it was a bad decision when they heard breaking glass and rush downstairs. The children found a note pinned to the door of Josephine's grammatical library, explaining how she found life hopeless and left them to the care of Captain Sham. The Baudelaires entered the library to find that their aunt had thrown herself out the wide window overlooking the lake.

They considered writing a forgery of the note to avoid being placed into Captain Sham's care and realized that that must be exactly what Sham did: throw their Aunt out the window and forged her note. When Mr. Poe arrived, he studied the note and decided it is not a forgery. He contacted Captain Sham to explain what happened and set up a meeting at

  </p>
  <p key="19b21ffa-4e89-4cae-80aa-cbd3f9d7103d">
   The Baudelaires then stole a sailboat and headed for Curdled Cave. When they reached it, they were happy to discover that Aunt Josephine was still alive. They learned that Aunt Josephine was planning on living with them in the cave for the rest of their lives. Josephine also explained she was forced to write the suicide note by Captain Sham or else he would drown her. She threw a stool out the wide window to fake a suicide scene, wrote the note so the Baudelaires would uncover her true location, and left the house, somehow inexplicably finding a way to Curdled Cave.
  </p>
  <p key="8f1c1d09-9391-49b5-8013-6d29e74991a9">
   After mentioning Curdled Cave as for sale and that meant realtors would come, the children persuaded her to come back to the mainland and explain to Mr. Poe who Captain Sham really was after Klaus explained that the cave is for sale and realtors will visit it. Unfortunately, not thinking of making another journey across the lake, Aunt Josephine had eaten a banana less than an hour before, and the smell attracted the Lachrymose Leeches. The leeches violently attacked their little boat and Violet hurriedly invented a signal in the hope of attracting attention to their situation. Just as the sailboat was quickly sinking, they were rescued by another boat. Unfortunately, Captain Sham was the one who came to the rescue.

   He was angered with Aunt Josephine for being alive when she should've been at the bottom of the lake. Aunt Josephine begged and pleads with him to spare her, saying she'll move away, dye her hair, change her name(Even giving up the Baudelaires in exchange for her own safety), nobody would ever hear from her again. It is thought that Captain Sham may have let her live if she had not corrected his grammar at the wrong time, and irritated him - but since she did, he pushed her over the side and into the waiting mouths of the leeches. Later, two
   fishermen
   found two life jackets in tatters.

  <p key="a15d9e64-e527-4355-b490-fc39ddd1bd01">
   It is never truly confirmed whether Josephine lost her life to the leeches. The life jackets are assumed to belong to her, but her remains are never found, meaning that she could have survived the attack and cast off her life jackets, possibly in an attempt to cause the assumption that she had perished; however, the truth is unknown, and it is more likely that she did indeed suffer her death at the hands of the leeches.

This occurred when Klaus told her about his fear of Olaf's ankle tattoo or when Violet asked for an explanation on why Josephine abandoned them, and even when Violet tried to save "each of their lives". Josephine correcting Count Olaf's grammar led to her demise. She also corrected Sunny's infantile sounds, forgetting that as a baby, Sunny was incapable of proper speech or grammar.

   Despite this, Josephine was kindhearted. She provided a home to three orphans because she didn't want them to feel alone. She gave them gifts in an attempt for them to feel welcome, and when Violet and Klaus offered to cook pasta she told them that it is the guardian's responsibility to prepare meals so they wouldn't have to face the dangers of the stove. She tried to warn them of the dangers in everyday objects to keep them all safe and tried to share the joys of grammar with them. It also seems that the orphans were a good influence on her. After seeing Violet answer the phone (which Josephine feared to do) she answered it herself the next time it rang.

       They didn't dare do anything but hope. Their feelings for Aunt Josephine were all a tumble in their minds. The Baudelaires had not really enjoyed most of their time with her not because she cooked horrible cold meals, or chose presents for them that they didn't like, or always corrected the children's grammar, but because she was so afraid of everything that she made it impossible to really enjoy anything at all. And the worst of it was, Aunt Josephine's fear had made her a bad guardian. A guardian is supposed to stay with children and keep them safe, but Aunt Josephine had run away at the first sign of danger. A guardian is supposed to help children in times of trouble, but Aunt Josephine practically had to be dragged out of the Curdled Cave when they needed her. And a guardian is supposed to protect children from danger, but Aunt Josephine had offered the orphans to Captain Sham in exchange for her own safety. But despite all of Aunt Josephine's faults, the orphans still cared about her. She had taught them many things, even if most of them were boring. She had provided a home, even if it was cold and unable to withstand hurricanes. And the children knew that Aunt Josephine, like the Baudelaires themselves, had experienced some terrible things in her life. So as their guardian faded from view and the lights of Damocles Dock approached closer and closer, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny did not think "Josephine, schmosephine." They thought "We hope Aunt Josephine is safe.

   As her long list of fears shows, Josephine could be irrational in her fears (something which Lemony Snicket himself mentions in his narration). While some of her fears had some justification, such as fearing Lake Lachrymose because of Ike's death or fearing the stove catching fire, her fear of realtors is never explained. Why she chose to live on a house literally hanging over the edge of the lake is unknown, but as it was the house she lived in with her husband, she may not have been able to let go, or because of her aforementioned fear of realtors. She demonstrated her tendency to irrational behavior again when she fled her house after faking her death and leaving a cryptic note for the children to follow and find her in Curdled Cave when it would have made more sense to take the children with her into hiding, or inform them of what had happened, or at least leave them a sensible note. She also showed a lack of forethought when she told the children that she intended to live in the cave indefinitely despite lacking in provisions or supplies. It should also be mentioned that in spite of her fear of the Lachrymose Leeches she forgot to warn the children that she had eaten a banana while waiting for them in the cave, and thus risked all of their lives as they tried to escape.

  </h2>
  <p key="09894266-73f0-42b8-9800-be68645c995e">
   Josephine is the English form of the French "Joséphine", a feminine form of Joseph, which is derived from the Hebrew "Yōsēf" which means "God/Jehovah will add/increase". Josephine's name may be derived from many hurricanes named Josephine, as a hurricane is a major part of the story and she prepares for it.
  </p>
  <p key="4df84919-ab25-43f0-9250-468f74551315">
   Anwhistle was likely chosen simply because her husband's name is "Ike Anwhistle" which phonetically sounds like "I can whistle". This may be a dark humor reference, as whistling requires oxygen, and Josephine was last seen drowning.

    It can be speculated that Josephine only cares about grammar because correcting other people makes her feel high-and-mighty and she relishes in a superiority complex, being more knowledgeable than other people. Lemony mentions that Josephine is "annoyed" when others point out she is wrong about something.
   </li>
   <li key="8bc52126-51da-47de-8c11-e37e3d6bc91c">
    In the movie, there is a deleted scene in which Josephine is seen sinking into the lake.
    It was likely removed because it was too disturbing and may have elevated it to a PG-13 rating. The final version cuts to Lemony on his typewriter saying, “you get the picture" and a banana peel floats up.
   </li>
   <li key="887b2ad0-6891-4f3b-90e3-e7ef233bf114">
    In the TV series, Josephine actually stands up to Count Olaf and tells him off before correcting his grammar, unlike her book and film versions. This is possibly due to Olaf mentioning how he would make her husband, Ike, the shredded beef tamale sandwiches he liked, which is what Ike ate when he died (at least in the TV series) and so she possibly blames Olaf for her husband's death and his grammatical error only angered her more. It is her criticizing Olaf's acting by calling him a "vastly untalented actor" that enrages him and causes him to throw her overboard instead of her correcting his grammar.
