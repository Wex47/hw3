   He was taken in the middle of the night and was carried out of the Snicket home by his ankles. While in the car, the volunteers that took him showed him a photo of him as a baby sleeping in his crib to prove that they had been watching him since his birth.

   Snicket's VFD training began when he was very young. However, he was known for arguing with his teachers until they became so flustered they simply told him to get to work.
  </p>
  <p key="97908539-dcc1-48f6-9210-c313ba13ffbf">
   He recounts several incidents during his training; for instance, he was taught that he should never have a serious conversation in a position in which he would have to look up at the other person, and when he pointed out that as children, they tended to be shorter than everyone else, he was punished by having to sit in the corner.
   He also spent a school year following strangers to learn about them.
   At some point, he had an Eavesdropping Instructor,
   and learned in "what most people would call a history class" how to hide things in plain sight.
   He also mentioned being forced to endure multiple fire drills.
   He mentioned having snuck into a teacher's office to find out information for their sneaking test. He passed top of the class and received a three-month suspension.

   As a child, Snicket spent a summer in a borrowed lake house with his family. The house's owner informed them that the infestation of geese would leave if they were not fed, but Snicket felt sorry for them that they must be forced to find their own food simply because they were loud and had no bathroom. That summer, Snicket began preparing his own breakfast- a glass of juice and a single piece of toast with jam- before anyone else in the house had awoken and when the sun had begun shining on the lake. Snicket would also prepare a second piece of toast, and then sneak out of the house and feed it to the geese. He enjoyed feeding them and also enjoyed having a secret. During this summer was the first time he read
   <i key="885e85e0-746b-4501-af64-3340e84700d0">
    The Long Secret
   </i>
   , which gave him his first existential crisis.
  </p>
  <p key="c8ac8b16-986c-4e47-895a-e3cc60ad92f3">
   He remembered taking a hike with his parents and siblings when he was young, in which a tree branch almost fell on them, and his mother leapt forwards and blocked it, telling her children that "We Snickets take care of our own."
  </p>
  <p key="c40c6536-f8af-4016-b6e7-f52385f0fc38">
   Fascinated by sneaking out in the mornings to feed the geese, Snicket began sneaking out at night following that summer, when he lived in the city; he says he snuck out through the back door into a dark alley, and he would then make sure he left nothing in the alley to cause anyone to panic. He would then run through the streets in his pajamas, thinking of the poem "
   The Highwayman
   ."

   When Snicket was young, he used to play a game called Beethoven with his brother, Jacques, while waiting for the bus. In the game, they would pretend to be hard of hearing, and purposely misunderstand each other. Kit, however, thought that the game was inane, and refused to play with them.
   When he was eight, he and several other students were taken into the woods to spend several nights. He learned then that a wild animal, when cornered, may suddenly and desperately defend itself, which is why Snicket doesn't like to spend time outdoors.

   , and he noted that he enjoyed her oral report on the history of the sonnet. Snicket accidentally embarrassed her in front of her friends while trying to talk to her, by telling her that showing up early was a sign of a noble person. He sent her a letter asking to meet her at a cafe for rootbeer floats to make up for it. At some point, he also had "an incident with [a] bottle of ink and [a] root beer float" that gave his classmate,

  </p>
  <p key="f4e74072-3ca4-4211-a67e-8e5aa0c6bac0">
   He and Beatrice did become friends, and he wrote her a note later during code class, while she was in theatrics, to give to R to deliver to her, in order to ask her to join him for a few hours of cave exploration, as Kit had informed him that there were bats inside the cave, and Beatrice was a baticeer.

   His final exam in Sneaking Class involved his instructor entering a small cabin, covered in glass figurines, in the middle of the leafy woods and sitting blindfolded in a folding chair, and to pass, the class would have to sneak up on him at midnight. Snicket broke into his office the night before and shared the location of the cabin with the rest of the class, and they arrived there before him. He received full marks and a three-month suspension.

   During his apprenticeship, Snicket attempted to start some kind of semi-coup, where he promised his associates that they "could make [their] organization greater than ever, but only if [they] stopped listening to [their] instructors and found new ways to fix the world." This almost got him kicked out of VFD.

   He and Kit planned to break into the Museum of Items in order to steal an important artifact that was only displayed in the museum once every eighty-four years. In order to do this, both siblings selected apprenticeships with chaperones in the city, where they would be able to measure the fountain being dug and get into the sewers, where they could break into the museum together. Snicket selected the chaperone

At that, Snicket realizes that the BBBG is just Kevin and Florence trying to get a sword and wood for a shelf and breaking an extra window to throw the police off. He does not explain this to the officers, though he says he hopes the vandals explain their behavior and help clean up. Theodora returns and he tells her that he did nothing all weekend, and she gives him an ugly teacup. He leaves it somewhere he might carelessly step on it.

   Snicket has trouble finding a book to read at the library, so he decides to go for a walk. He asks Qwerty why there's fog outside, as the town no longer has water. He talks about the many suspicious incidents he's encountered in his own, and Qwerty points out that to the people of Stain'd-by-the-Sea, Snicket is the suspicious incident.

       Get scared later, I told myself, just as I'd advised my associates. Get scared later, and if you're scared now remember what Kit always said. If you're not scared, she told me, it's not bravery. And you want to be brave, don't you, Snicket? Of course you do. Of course I did, but I still felt sick. It was a sickness in my stomach and in my mouth and even in my heart. The symptoms were nervousness and dread. I don't know what the illness was called. I've had it since I was a child.

   Moxie arrives, having finally discovered something while searching the newspaper archives. She found an article about when the town was planning to drain the sea; Porter Roeman, who ran the Roe House at 350 Wayward Way- a fish business- said that the draining would adversely affect local marine life. Moxie wonders if the large, empty Roe House might be Hangfire's next headquarters. Moxie then asks for the newspaper article he's hiding beneath the book. Theodora then arrives, shouting "fire" in order to get Snicket's attention. She tells Snicket to leave, giving Moxie the opportunity to take the newspaper clipping Theodora then tells him that their next client is at 350 Wayward Way.

She asks them to talk to the one witness, Harold Limetta, who lives at 431 Ballpoint Drive. On the way out, Snicket tells Kellar that he can find him at Hungry's Diner, and Kellar tells Snicket to look up Harold Limettta.

   Upon arriving at Harold's home, they find it burnt to the ground.

   The next day, he arrives at Hungry's to find Jake, Cleo, Moxie, Hungry and the firefighters, the Talkie Brothers. Everyone is very cryptic about what happened, so Snicket leaves with his associates, and Cleo drives them to the Department of Education. As they drive, Cleo explains that the fire was not put out correctly, as the water in the hydrants had been replaced with a chemical that made the blaze worse. They arrive at Wayward Way, and Snicket explains that he wants to see if Kellar has information for them. Upon mentioning his obsession with Italian, Snicket finds out from Cleo that the Italian word for lime is

   He returns to The Lost Arms to find Theodora cleaning up from the party, and he finds out that Sharon and Hangfire threatened her into leaving town, and she agreed under the condition that her apprentice be left alone. Snicket refuses to abandon his friends, but he's shocked when Theodora tells him if they leave they can free Kit, who he didn't know she knew about. He still leaves her to rescue his associates, taking Ellington's phonograph with him.

   Snicket finds Pip and Squeak at Hungry's, begging for food; they have been hiding from the Department of Truancy for three days to avoid being kidnapped to Wade Academy.

   When he awakens, he finds that he was dragged inside to safety by Ellington, who also broke into the school to find Hangfire, under disguise as Filene N. Gottlin. While she claims the Bombinating Beast statue was stolen from her, Snicket doesn't believe her. She also tells him that the students of the academy are being drugged with laudanum, the effects of which are fought by her coffee. After she cries to him about wanting to find her father, and he comforts her, they are interrupted by Sharon Haines, who comes to tell Ellington to keep to her part of the plan. While Snicket hides under the bed, he spots the green bag she usually carries the statue in. Ellington tells him to remove his shoes and socks so they can sneak through the halls, and after some protests, he does, revealing to her his VFD tattoo. She recognizes it as a secret organization, but the only way Snicket can think of to differentiate between VFD and the Inhumane Society is that VFD reads more.

   They sneak through the halls and reach the library, where they meet with Jake, Cleo, Kellar, Moxie and Ornette Lost; Cleo found a bark outside that also fights the effects of the laudanum. They discuss their plan, and Snicket reveals to them his association with VFD and recruits them as ad hoc members. Kellar tells them that they're to go on a field trip the next day, so Snicket tells them to go and then sneak off to Hungry's as soon as Ellington, who will be left behind, rings the bell, as Sharon ordered her to. Before they leave, Kellar gives Snicket a compass, which he realizes is a clue that Hangfire plans to burn the library; the sprinklers are in the northeast corner.

   Before returning to her room, Ellington takes Snicket to a fire pond, where they see some kind of creature swimming inside. Snicket believes it may be a decoy meant to scare people, and once they arrive at her room, he accuses her of still having the statue. She opens her bag and shows him it's empty, and then he lets her sleep while he watches over her. When she awakes, he makes coffee, and asks her to take a hayride with him after she rings the bell.

He tells them to throw a wagon over the wall while Ornette distracts Stew, who is guarding the students, and then asks them to throw over the books from the library, which are all blank. After the bus leaves, he takes the Bellerophon taxi into town, falling asleep on the way. When he awakes, he asks the Bellerophons to return to Wade Academy and take the blank books and switch them out with the books in the library, and then attach the wagon to their car for the hayride.

However, Qwerty does not want to leave, as he can deliver important information about Hangfire to the city. Snicket then hears a crash and a scream and runs to the next compartment when the train makes an unexpected stop. There, he finds Qwerty dead, and Theodora standing over him.

   Snicket returns to Moxie's compartment, and finds out that Kellar and Moxie both have false Bombinating Beasts; they had the same idea, meaning that Hangfire knows they're lying. Jake and Cleo, who also snuck aboard the train, enter the compartment. Snicket tells them about Qwerty's murder, which causes him to cry. After telling his associates to gather their notes and evidence, he goes to the cafe compartment.

He offers to help her join VFD if she helps him finally defeat Hangfire, but she is then hit with a poison dart and drops to the ground, shattering her music box. Snicket turns to see that Hangfire has entered the compartment, and then he tells Snicket firstly how he makes poison darts, and then that he is following the course of nature. He opens Ellington's bag and finds no statue, and Snicket claims that he has it and will trade it for Theodora's release. Hangfire agrees and tells him that he will send someone to fetch him.

   After Hangfire leaves, Snicket tells Ellington to get up; she'd faked her death while Hangfire was in the room. She realizes that her father is likely dead and agrees to join Snicket. He then has her hang outside the train so that Hangfire cannot find her, promising her that they'll travel together once she joins VFD, mentioning Winnipeg as one of the locations. Her terror at being held outside the train confirms to him that she was not the murderer, as he realized that the killer would have to be outside of the train due to how the glass shattered.

   Before Hangfire can use the statue, Snicket knocks him over and takes it from him; his mask falls off, revealing him to have been Armstrong Feint the whole time.

   The train crashes, and when Snicket exits, none of his associates will look at him. He explains what has happened ot the other passengers and tells the librarians and Pip and Squeak that he will send them accounts of his time in Stain'd-by-the-Sea. He then finds out that the Mitchums are arresting Ellington in order to protect Stew; however, Ellington rejects his help, furious and grief-stricken at him for killing her father in front of her. He turns to Gifford and Ghede, and they tell him that they had a plan which required him remaining in the city, and he ruined it by escaping them.

He walks into the Clusterous Forest, whistling the tune Ellington played for him and carrying the statue of the Bombinating Beast in his pocket.

   Snicket moved to a house atop a hill in a seaside town; he soon becomes used to the town, including
   Incomparable Tea
   , the
   Beekeeper
   , and
   the library
   . He grew a dislike for both bakers in the town, one of whom was too slow and the other of whom was too rude, and so resorted to buying bread from a supermarket. He also suggested to a bored Goatherd to bring a book with him on his trips to the park with the goats, only for the Goatherd to respond that he'd tried that and the goats had eaten the book. His childhood friend, the
   Shoemaker
   , dies, leaving an impact on him.

   At some point, Snicket made a poached egg for a young man, who didn't want it; Snicket told him that it was fluffy and wouldn't kill him, and the man responded that they would kill him because eventually he would die. This gave Snicket a writing idea, and he wrote "You had poison for breakfast" on a slip of paper, and then subsequently forgot about it. The paper ended up falling in his doorway, which he found one morning after breakfast. Thinking it was a warning, Snicket spent the day investigating the places he got food for his breakfast, which was

   a good book
   , and then went to
   Incomparable Tea

   Beekeeper
   , who suggested investigating his water; instead, Snicket dove into the ocean and swam for some time. He then went to the supermarket where he got his bread, escaped it, and traveled to the park to watch the goats that gave him his cheese. He then fell under a pear tree and remained face-down in the gravel for some time, having an imaginary conversation with a translator and an author. He began heading to the chicken farm, but instead decided to go to the library, where he shared the note with his favorite librarian, referred to as
   Emily Dickinson
   . She directed him to his favorite table, where he realized he himself had written the note and began to write
