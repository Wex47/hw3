  <p key="856dec16-7b39-4abb-ad36-09d149f1fa10">
   Handler was born in
   San Francisco, California
   , the son of Sandra Handler Day (née Walpole), an opera singer and retired
   City College of San Francisco
   Dean, and Lou Handler, an accountant.
   His father was a Jewish refugee from Germany, and his mother is distantly related to British writer
   Hugh Walpole
   .
   Handler has a younger sister, Rebecca Handler.
  </p>
  <p key="f74d4412-9877-4bcf-b334-8f489d069c12">
   Growing up, he hated books that were overly sappy, preferring writers such as Roald Dahl and Edward Gorey. He attended Commodore Sloat Elementary,
   Herbert Hoover Middle School
   and
   Lowell High School
   , where he graduated with the Valedictorian title. Handler attended
   Wesleyan University
   , where he began writing poetry. In 1990, Handler won the Poets Prize from the Academy of American Poets, then graduated from Wesleyan in 1992. Soon after, he won an Owin Fellowship and used the prize money to fund his first novel,

   .
   He is an alumnus of the
   San Francisco Boys Chorus
   . After college, Handler moved to New York to work as a freelance book and movie critic.
  </p>
  <p key="ebe1a51b-ab9c-46f1-a778-5862d8a6b62c">
   Handler is married to
   Lisa Brown
   , a graphic designer whom he met in college. They have a son, Otto, born in 2003, and live in an old Victorian house in San Francisco.
  </p>
  <p key="c7dc4b41-bdd2-4135-8ce1-a04cfaa5561a">
   Handler is politically active and helped form LitPAC, or Literature Political Action Committee, an organization blending politics and literature.
  </p>
  <p key="74ef8d8b-55d6-465c-be14-7128114820d0">
   Handler and his wife have donated $1,000,000 to Planned Parenthood.

   Handler is very pro-knowledge and pro-reading, as seen in his works where the villains often shun reading, knowledge and literature and instead choose to remain ignorant, with some even going so far to advocate book burning. He also enjoys poetry.
  </p>
  <p key="88bc2d58-1971-4740-976d-719e1ce141ab">
   He is also a proponent of critical thinking, as well as rejecting complacency when it comes to evil, which is one of the main themes of
   <i key="2e118e3f-d9cb-4ddb-bbfa-09b2e31cec5d">

   due to the numerous complacent and corrupt adults in it. One quote from
   <i key="1bb20b58-c2ed-4b1e-b105-528dcb5f7272">
    All the Wrong Questions
   </i>
   is: "We are told to ignore bullies. It's something they teach you, and they can teach you anything. It doesn't mean you learn it. It doesn't mean you believe it. One should never ignore bullies. One should stop them."
  </p>
  <p key="f05396d9-4ada-451e-bcac-269935fb571c">
   He has revealed ambivalence toward his wealth, and the expectations it creates, stating that he is often asked for money for charitable causes, and often gives in.
   His attitudes toward money can be seen in
   <i key="66e79071-3e7e-463b-a62f-9b50ea7fa347">
    The Ersatz Elevator
   </i>
   , which can be viewed as a deconstruction of how money can negatively impact people.
  </p>
  <p key="b28f9805-4189-4792-a431-8ce76fb99eba">
   Although Handler has a partially Jewish background and considers
   C. S. Lewis
   to be an influence, he describes himself as a secular humanist.
   In addition, he says, "I'm not a believer in predetermined fates, being rewarded for one's efforts. I'm not a believer in karma. The reason why I try to be a good person is because I think it's the right thing to do. If I commit fewer bad acts there will be fewer bad acts, maybe other people will join in committing fewer bad acts, and in time there will be fewer and fewer of them."
   Handler mentions he is not a religious person.
   In a rare magazine interview with Marvin Olasky of World Magazine, he apparently once described himself as "pretty much an atheist."
  </p>
  <p key="d71686f6-1399-42ae-b79f-dcd86dc6e4ce">
   He does not support performing traditions on the sole basis of them being done for a long time. In

    The Austere Academy
   </i>
   , Lemony Snicket mentions, "Just because something is traditional is no reason to do it, of course. Piracy, for example, is a tradition that has been carried on for hundreds of years, but that doesn't mean we should all attack ships and steal their gold."
  </p>
  <p key="f085d9a5-4aa1-43ac-b50f-3c00e747ddeb">
   In an interview conducted by the 667 Dark Avenue fan site, Handler gave his personal philosophy as "Never refuse a breath mint".
  </p>
  <p key="63c73a87-c260-4722-9f4e-9d20af6394b9">
   Handler is also a bit of a food aficionado, with his books often containing recipes.

   Handler originally came up with "Lemony Snicket" as a pseudonym to use, rather than placing his real name on the mailing lists of several right-wing organizations he was researching for one of his novels. It became something of an in-joke with his friends, who were known to order pizzas under the name. When he found himself writing a series of children's books, he decided to use the Snicket name to add an air of mystery to proceedings. And so, Lemony Snicket was born.

   under the Snicket pseudonym in 1999. The books concern three orphaned children who experience progressively terrible events following the alleged death of their parents and the burning of their home, and Snicket acts as the narrator and biographer of the fictional orphans. The three orphans were taken into care by a distant relative by the name of Count Olaf. He treated the orphans horribly. He has also narrated the audiobooks for three consecutive books in the series, before deciding to quit because he found it too difficult, handing back the narrating job to the original narrator, Tim Curry.

   Handler did submit a commentary track for the DVD version of the movie, alongside director
   Brad Silberling
   . In character as Lemony Snicket, he derides the Lemony Snicket in the film–played by

   –as an impostor, as well as choosing to play the accordion and sing about leeches rather than pay attention to the film. At numerous times during the track, he shows great sympathy towards the Baudelaire children and implies that he is being held captive by the director in order to do the commentary. At one point, Silberling says something racially insensitive, which Handler calls him out for.
   It is unclear if both of them were in on it.

   . Although he did participate in the read-through for the early scripts, he mentioned he was unsure how much would carry over into the final cut of the episodes. Early in the production of the season, he received an e-mail from one of the production team members, saying "We'd rather not have you involved at this point."

    "I was the sort of child who liked to think about difficult questions. A lot of it was my own Jewish upbringing. My father escaped Nazis when he was a small child. I grew up hearing a lot of stories around the dinner table of horrible acts and about getting out of situations by the skin of one's teeth—also the lesson that behaving well is not necessarily rewarded. I think the bewildering chaos of life was instilled in me at a young age and I understood that at any moment something terrible could happen. That's something interesting to think about as a child. And it's the shape of so much children's literature that has endured. I think that speaks to a child's bewilderment of the world. I think that when you're a very small child, everything that happens to you is new. Everything is shocking. So I think I've kept that sense with me growing up."
