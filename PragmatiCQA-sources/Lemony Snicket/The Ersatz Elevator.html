The doorman of the penthouse, who is dressed in a long coat that covers his hands, tells them that the building has either 48 or 84 floors, and explains to them that they won't be able to use the elevator to get to the penthouse where their guardians live. When questioned why, he explains the elevator is "out". He explains that the elevator is not out of order, but the neighborhood recently decided that elevators and light are no longer "
   in

The orphans wonder what would happen if orphans were "out." The children are then allowed to pick out their rooms. Violet chooses the room with a workbench although tools are "out."

   After a few days of living with the Squalors, Esmé later mentions that it is boring to listen to the Baudelaires' worries about the two Quagmire triplets. She gives them pinstripe suits she has bought for them because they are very "in." Esmé says they will go to

   Jerome takes them to Café Salmonella, which the Baudelaires don't enjoy, not because of the bad food, but the thought of Gunther. Jerome explains to them he thinks they are being xenophobic, which in this case means having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries. The Baudelaires encourage Jerome to see value in arguing with Esmé more, as it meant he could have had a meal he enjoyed, but Jerome dismisses the idea, saying, "Someday, when you're older, you'll understand."

   When they arrive home the doorman says no one is allowed up to the penthouse until Gunther leaves, and he says he hasn't. Jerome explains that he may be on his way down and so the doorman lets them go. When they reach the penthouse Esmé tells them that Gunther left a long time ago.

   The next day, Jerome offers to take the children to a tailor to fix their pinstripes but Esmé says he must go pick up the new "in" drink,
   parsley soda
   . The children are alone and decide to search the penthouse for Gunther, as they believe he might be hiding. Using bread crumbs to track their progress in their ridiculously large suite, they find nothing, so they decide to look for him in the other apartments by listening through doors. They reach the bottom and find nothing but the fact that the building is 66 stories high. The doorman is putting up decorations on the elevator and Klaus begins to think really hard. At that time Esmé and Jerome come in with crates of parsley soda. They climb the staircase while Esmé is talking(Saying a clue to V.F.D that no one notices), Klaus is thinking, and the rest pretend to be interested.

   That night Klaus tells his sister that there is one elevator on each floor except for the top floor which has two. They go to investigate and find one is an ersatz elevator, with a huge drop down. They then make an ersatz rope out of cords, ties, and curtains. They climb down and find the Quagmires trapped in a large cage. They say Gunther is trying to put them in as an object for the auction and then have an associate bid the highest and smuggle them out of the city. Violet says she could melt and bend the metal cage and they go back up to make the invention. They find three fire tongs and warm them up in one of the 50 or so ovens in the penthouse. They climb back down to find the Quagmires had been taken by Count Olaf again. They are very grieved and go back up to the penthouse.
  </p>
  <p key="c380bf24-79e8-4505-8c11-55d4283e7244">
   There they find a note from Jerome that says he has left and that Esmé will take them to the auction. Klaus decides to look in the auction catalog to see if they can find the lot that the Quagmires will be put into. They decide it must be lot #50, V.F.D. When they go to tell Esmé she actually listens for once, and says that they must go to the In Auction to save them. She calmly walks out the door and she leads them to the ersatz elevator. She opens the door and pushes them down the shaft, but they don't hit the ground. They hit a net and become trapped. Esmé laughs and says that Olaf is a wonderful person and that he was her acting teacher. She leaves them and goes to the auction.

   Sunny uses her teeth to climb up the shaft. Violet tells her to get the ersatz rope and jump down here. Sunny bites a hole in the net and they attach the rope to the pegs that hold up the net. They climb through the hole till they reach the bottom. At the bottom are Violet's ersatz welding torches, which they use to light their way down the hall at the bottom. When they reach the end of the long hall they don't know what to do. They try getting someone's attention by banging on the ceiling. Ash falls on them.

   They rush to the auction at Veblen Hall. Inside, they see a huge crowd of people including Mr. Poe and Jerome. One peculiar factor in this scene is that Jerome is seen eating a salmon puff, even though earlier in the book he stated that he can't stand the taste of salmon. This could be a reason to believe that Jerome might be in disguise or stated that he didn't like salmon for some unknown reason. Gunther and Esmé are on the stage where they are just auctioning off Lot #46. They tell Jerome and Mr. Poe to buy them Lot #50. Lot #48, a statue of a

   Gunther skips Lot #49 and goes right to #50 which is a big box with V.F.D. written on it. Mr. Poe and Jerome back down and then Sunny bids $1,000 dollars on it. The Baudelaires rush up and tear the box open only to reveal

   The Baudelaires wish to chase after Olaf and rescue their friends. However, Jerome does not because he thinks it is too dangerous. Jerome quits being their guardian, wishes them luck, and sadly says his goodbye. The Baudelaires sit on the steps of Veblen Hall in tears, watching him leave.

   The next time you run out of milk, buy a new carton at Cash Register #19 of the Not-Very-Supermarket. When you arrive home, you will find my description of the Baudelaires' recent experience in this dreadful town, entitled THE VILE VILLAGE, has been tucked into your grocery sack, along with a burnt-out torch, the tip of a harpoon, and a chart of the migration paths of the V.F.D. crows. There is also a copy of the official portrait of the Council of Elders, to help Mr. Helquist with his illustrations.

     Alleviated
    </b>
    : The terror of the long, dark fall was alleviated--the word "alleviated" here means "not particularly on Sunny's mind"-- because the youngest Baudelaire knew that a net, and her siblings, were waiting for her at the bottom.
   </li>
   <li key="7cd1ddc9-386b-4c76-bb06-7195d5dbb636">

     As if he were the cat's pajamas

    : Esmé was sitting in a fancy chair and gazing at Gunther as if he were the cat's pajamas, a phrase which here means "a charming and handsome gentleman instead of a cruel and dishonest villain."

     Broke their fall
    </b>
    : Something broke their fall, a phrase which here means that the Baudelaires' plunge was stopped halfway between the sliding elevator doors and the metal cage where the Quagmires had been locked up.
   </li>
   <li key="b9827c29-d940-4ee8-b3ab-69b4eeea7aaf">

     Cul-de-sac
    </b>
    : The French expression "cul-de-sac" describes what the Baudelaire orphans found when they reached the end of the dark hallway, and like all French expressions, it is most easily understood when you translate each French word into English. The word "de," for instance, is a very common French word, so even if I didn't know a word of French, I would be certain that "de" means "of." The word "sac" is less common, but I am fairly certain that it means something like "mysterious circumstances." And the word "cul" is such a rare French word that I am forced to guess at its translation, and my guess is that in this case, it would mean "At the end of the dark hallway, the Baudelaire children found an assortment," so that the expression "cul-de-sac" here means "At the end of the dark hallway, the Baudelaire children found an assortment of mysterious circumstances."

     Disconcerting
    </b>
    : Esmé was so quiet and calm that it was disconcerting, a word which here means "a warning that the Baudelaire children did not heed in time."

    <b key="aef825ad-64df-44e7-b2fc-56b7b1632609">
     Dogged determination
    </b>
    : The count had pursued them with a dogged determination, a phrase which here means "everywhere they went, thinking up treacherous schemes and wearing disguises to try to fool the three children."

     Fared no better

    <b key="f387004e-34df-4c52-b72f-4d190ec1fc1e">
     Hide or hair of them
    </b>
    : Jerome and Esmé were apparently spending the evening in some room in another part of the apartment, because the Baudelaires didn't see hide or hair of them--the expression "hide or hair of them" here means "even a glimpse of the city's sixth most important financial advisor or her husband"

     Hit the jackpot

    <b key="24b99598-60fd-420b-87f1-602f6d448d14">
     Hubbub

     Knocked him over with a feather

     Nefarious disguises

    <b key="fd738733-b00d-4f5b-a616-e971373132dc">
     Never been her forte
    </b>
    : Cooking had never been Violet's forte—a phrase which here means "something she couldn't do very well"

     Stiffening of their resolve
    </b>
    : At the mention of the Quagmire triplets, all three Baudelaires felt a stiffening of their resolve, a phrase which here means "realized that they had to search the penthouse for Gunther, even though it was a scary thing to do."
   </li>
   <li key="57887536-49f4-4ec8-8ae3-c4c9f1dd545c">
