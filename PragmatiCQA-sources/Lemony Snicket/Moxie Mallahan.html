  </h2>
  <p key="42fa653d-d77d-4695-ad90-625090aaf609">
   Moxie is a very inquisitive and curious person, always asking questions of everyone and everything around her. In search of answers she is often courageous to the point of being reckless, such as the time she was stabbed trying to help Lemony despite the fact he told her many times that it would be dangerous and that she didn’t need to in WDYSHL. Many of these traits seem to be picked up from her parents, both of them being successful journalists, particularly the attitude of “A good polite voice is the journalist's best tool” from her mother.
  </p>
  <p key="a9434c40-1e10-457b-8df8-08d7ea959010">
   She has quite a bit of a jealous streak, as well as a tendency to quickly assume people’s feelings and thoughts without full context. This is especially prominent in her interactions with Lemony in regards to Ellington Feint, she tends to assume that he’s thinking about her and get snappy with him because of it.
  </p>
  <p key="d0bc38d7-1cfc-4c35-bb0d-1863895c342d">
   Connected to both her reckless curiosity and jealousy, she’s extremely loyal. She’s very happy being called an associate of both Lemony and the entire association of associates, devoting herself to helping them and the rest of Stain’d-By-The-Sea.

   . The paper ran from the family's lighthouse; photographs were developed in the basement, reporters would type up stories in the lantern room, papers would be printed with the town's ink, and then they would be dried on the hawser that ran from the lighthouse to the Sallis Mansion, as the Sallis's were old friends of the Mallahans. The newspaper's mascot was the

   Moxie's parents taught her about journalism and how to get information; her mother told her "a good polite voice is the journalist's best tool because people are more likely to tell you important information if you treat them nicely." Her father also taught her the term "troublesome underlings", as he used to jokingly call his employees that.

   drained the sea to find more ink, the ink in town started to fade, making articles seem less certain, and the paper was shut down. Moxie's mother left town, claiming that she was leaving for a job at another newspaper and would eventually send for them, though she never planned to return nor send for her family. Her father fell into a depression, leaving Moxie as the only reporter left in town. She stopped going to school in order to help support her father. During her journalism research, she came across some mentions of

   are hired to investigate a stolen statue by Murphy Sallis, who believes that it was taken by the Mallahan family. They go to the Mallahan Lighthouse, and when they arrive, Snicket is left with Moxie, who is sitting on the steps and typing. She hands him her business card and then tries to interview him. He eventually tells her- off the record- that he's solving a mystery connected to the Bombinating Beast. Moxie laughs and takes him up to the newsroom of the lighthouse, which is now abandoned but still holds a collection of Bombinating Beast merchandise. Moxie shows him the collection, including a small statue replica of the beast, which is what Snicket had been looking for.
  </p>
  <p key="2201244f-2def-4d74-a6ee-7a94d459d72c">
   That night, Snicket arrives at the lighthouse and invites Moxie to a burglary taking place at her home; S. Theodora is planning to use the hawser to steal "back" the Bombinating Beast Statue, and asked Snicket to sneak into the tower and let her in. Moxie doesn't care about the statue, so she agrees to help him; she shows him the telegram, and he fixes them dinner. The bell rings, signaling that the residents of Stain'd-by-the-Sea should wear their masks, which Moxie believes is to prevent salt lung. They both read in the study until the bell signals an all-clear, and when Moxie says she wants to watch the burglary, Snicket tells her to hide, as Theodora probably wouldn't approve of her watching the robbery. He lets Theodora into the lighthouse, and they steal the statue and leave.

   The next morning, Moxie receives a call that she thinks is from Snicket, telling her that he's solved the mystery of the Bombinating Beast and to go to

   , who wanted the statue and could imitate voices. Before he can answer more of Moxie's questions, they hear screaming from the nearby Sallis Mansion. They enter the house, and have to search it; Snicket tells Moxie to do the scary thing first and get scared later.
  </p>
  <p key="a77e02c9-d56b-49fc-9509-53c26a7aa5be">
   Moxie and Snicket figure out the screaming is coming from the basement, which is being flooded; a woman is tied up and left to drown, and while Snicket drains the water, Moxie unties the woman, who Snicket believes is Murphy Sallis. Moxie informs him that was not Mrs. Salliis- the real Mrs. Sallis was named Dot, and had known Moxie for a while. Snicket figures out that the woman is an actress, Dame
   Sally Murphy
   , and his entire mission had been fake. Snicket tries to help the hysterical woman, saying he's part of an organization, though he doesn't explain it to Moxie when Sally Murphy refuses and they leave. Snicket asks her to investigate Handkerchief Heights while he goes into town.

   Moxie comes up with a plan to catch Hangfire; she has Ornette fold a false statue of the Bombinating Beast, and then tells Hangfire to meet her on the train out of town,

   where he'll be caught by the authorities. When she gets on the train, she has to pull Snicket inside, as he jumps onto the edge of the train to cling to the railings; Ornette sent him a folded train, and his chaperone also snuck aboard.

   She shows Snicket her fake Bombinating Beast, only to be interrupted by Gifford and Ghede, members of VFD, who are disguised as conductors. Snicket gets out of not having a ticket, as he recognizes them and threatens to tell Moxie, a journalist, about how they tried to kidnap him. After they leave, Moxie explains her plan to him over a lunch Jake prepared for her. They hear an argument from the car beside them, which Moxie identifies as the prison car, the place Qwerty is being held. Snicket listens in to the argument he is having with Theodora, and then Snicket hears some kind of fight. He leaves Moxie in her compartment while he goes to investigate.

   He later sends Kellar to her compartment, where the two of them find out they had the same plan, and two false Bombinating Beast statues; Hangfire must know their plans are fake and has evaded their plan. Snicket returns, and Jake and Cleo also enter, having snuck on the train when it stopped. Snicket reveals to them that Qwerty was murdered and Theodora was framed for the crime. He then leaves to confront Hangfire.

  <p key="10513063-f5f3-42df-a2e6-35fae5b4a360">
   While he's gone, the group is joined by Ornette, and they manage to make a report of the case with all of their notes. When Snicket returns, he tells them that he's agreed to give the statue- which he doesn't have- to Hangfire in exchange for Theodora's release. Stew arrives to escort Snicket to Hangfire, and Moxie threatens to fight him should he try to hurt her associate. When Snicket leaves, Moxie also departs to fetch Gifford and Ghede, who are VFD authorities.

  <p key="a597cf78-bef6-43db-85ca-f5b9ba77aa8c">
   Moxie later confronts Hangfire with her other associates, when Ellington gives him the Bombianting Beast statue in exchange for her father. Snicket steals the statue and summons the Bombinating Beast, and he feeds Hangfire to it, an event that horrifies Moxie and severs her attachment to him; Snicket notices that she barely looks at him after this.
  </p>
  <p key="f40453a8-9989-4fb1-b8ee-e97ad272a437">
   After the train crash, Moxie sits outside with the others, and she helps her associates explain the mystery to all the other passengers. She also decides not to help Snicket try to free Ellington, who's been helping Hangfire since she arrived in town, though she does say she's typing up the truth. Snicket eventually leaves, going into the Clusterous Forest, and Moxie finishes a page of type and gives him a wave goodbye.

   Moxie has dark gray eyes that Snicket described as "dark grey, as if they had once been black but somebody had washed them or had made her cry for a long time." Her hair color is unknown but the illustrations show it is light-colored. She is not taller than Snicket, as stated in
