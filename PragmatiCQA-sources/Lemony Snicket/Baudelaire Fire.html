   The precise cause of the fire has never been established and no one was ever charged for setting it. The mystery of what or who started the fire has been a large debate in the series fandom for a long time. One must also remember that there are three conflicting documentations of the fire (The book series, the Paramount film and Netflix adaptation) so the circumstances that led to how it began may differ in all of them.
  </p>
  <p key="af511b31-1176-4bed-a06d-0c84b87041d1">
   One major and popular theory behind the fire is that

    Count Olaf

   is the culprit. He has had a history of starting similar fires and admits to being guilty of "arson". His possible motives include getting the

   , Count Olaf seemed to deny his involvement; when Klaus accused him of starting the fire, he only answered, "Is that what you think?" after a long pause, and then after Sunny says, "We know it," he responds, "You don't know anything." Olaf had a tendency to brag about his crimes yet he did not boast about the fire, which means that he may not be lying about his claim but at the same time, covering up his tracks was his specialty given his profession as an actor.
   However, it is never confirmed nor denied either by Olaf, so he may not have been involved.
  </p>
  <p key="3c708798-59ec-4a03-80c7-8ede65fa6b41">
   Another possibility is that the arsonists were the
   Man With a Beard But No Hair
   and the

   , however it is unknown why their motives would be to setting the fire, other than making the children orphans. Another person could be

   . A motive for Esmé to set the fire is to get ahold of the Baudelaire fortune(In

   , it is revealed that Esmé got ahold of the Quagmire Fortune). It is also possible that a member Olaf's troupe started the fire. Or another theory is that an unknown member of the
   fire-starting side of V.F.D.
   is responsible.
  </p>
  <p key="83593a30-fe31-4980-8bbe-8e58156d12a1">
   There is also a theory that the
   fire-fighting side
   may have set the fire in an attempt to orphan the Baudelaires and recruit them. While this may seem far-fetched and evil, it should be noted that V.F.D recruits new volunteers by kidnapping,
   and it is noted that the Denouement triplets were recruited without their parents' knowledge, and that their house suspiciously burnt down after the boys were taken.
  </p>
  <p key="e02a5035-7ea4-41c2-a007-8004e4406782">
   Last not but least, in the best-case scenario, the fire possibly occurred by accident as opposed to an arson, as the Baudelaires are shown to have extremely bad luck. This may be the cause in the book canon only, as the movie and TV series canons imply arson. It could have been caused by one of Violet's inventions malfunctioning. For example, Violet mentioned in the

   The evidence backing this theory would mean that Beatrice escaped the fire at her mansion, attempted to reunite with her children, but sadly perished in the Duchess's burning mansion before her survival could be known. This theory, though popular and well-researched, has never ultimately been confirmed. This theory is non-canon in the TV Series since in that timeline, the masked ball had occurred before the Baudelaire children were born.
