   Olaf is greedy and he is obsessed with the Baudelaires' inheritance. He is a stalker who has followed them to their new homes, and even kills some of their guardians. In the TV series, he claims money is the most important substance on earth, apart from applause and lip balm. This opinion may be the result of him growing up in a society where money is everything, as the saying goes: "money makes the world go around." Later, it is revealed that Olaf was also an orphan, and his misfortunes throughout his life have shaped him into something grotesque. At the end of "

   ", Olaf comments that he knows what "a great deal of suffering and pain and then a long fall to rock bottom" feels like. He comes off as an extremely cynical and jaded realist who has come to accept that life is unfair. His behavior and mentality is likely the result of someone who has felt he has been "wronged" multiple times. For example, he was expelled from school because he did not do well in gym class, greatly hurting his dream of becoming a famous actor, as well as future job prospects and opportunities. While the books imply his parents were murdered, in the TV series, he lost his mother in a fire and his father was later killed by Beatrice, explaining his hatred for the

   Olaf seems to be a misanthrope who has stopped caring about human society, which could explain why he is unhygienic as he seems to have stopped caring about what other people think of him or appealing to the standards of others. This contrasts him to Esmé Squalor who cares too much about what other people think of her. He claims he's not the only one in the world who runs around with their secrets and their schemes to outwit others and that "everyone" else is guilty of it, implying he views humanity constantly trying to control and manipulate others for their desires. Olaf dislikes pretentious people and know-it-alls like Klaus. Olaf also may be antinatalist; before he dies, he says, "Man hands on misery to man. It deepens like a coastal shelf. Get out as early as you can, And don't have any kids yourself" (quoting the poem
   "This Be The Verse"
   by Philip Larkin). In the TV series, he says the last part like a warning to the Baudelaires.
  </p>
  <p key="7a355ce4-594f-40e8-bbb0-ce71088fe96c">
   In the TV series, he called himself a "rebel" in school, likely due to his annoyance at all the rules set by those in power in society, and the often ridiculous pedantic following of them society is seen throughout the series. This makes him different than the many other adults in the series such as Mr. Poe and Justice Strauss who feel the constant need to follow the law, even to the point of absurdity. Olaf could also be viewed as a free thinker like the Baudelaires.
  </p>
  <p key="89f69000-7b94-42ab-8ee1-97f10b5e7268">
   Olaf is revealed to be rather intelligent. An example of this being how Violet thinks: "The really frightening thing about Olaf, was that he was very smart after all. He wasn’t merely an unsavory drunken brute, but an unsavory, clever drunken brute." He employs his acting skills and is a master of disguise, using various disguises in his plots. In the movie and TV series, he is shown to be talented doing accents. His disguises usually do little besides cover his eyebrow and tattoo, which is sufficient to fool most. The Baudelaires can recognize his other characteristics, such as his wheezy voice and shiny eyes, but others don't notice these marks, and very few of them believe the Baudelaires' claims to recognize him.
  </p>
  <p key="445ee4fd-cd96-41ba-bd61-2e5a0cf3880c">
   As the main villain of the series, Olaf is violent and terrifying. He is a psychopath/sociopath involved with murder, kidnapping and arson. Apart from trying to kill the Baudelaires numerous times, he also once threatened to cut off one of Sunny's toes in

   He is psychologically manipulative, uses gaslighting techniques and often plays the victim card. In the TV show he views the Baudelaires as spoiled rich kids who never had to work hard in their lives, even when they defend themselves by saying they help around the house, Olaf simply doesn't care, probably because he thinks mere house chores do not compare to his life struggles and hardships. He says he chose to offer his heart to the Baudelaires and they won't even serve him roast beef, and he blames them, despite that he never asked for it. However, this could just be his excuse to slap Klaus, as it seems that it was not the roast beef that set him off, but rather, Klaus reminding him that the Baudelaire fortune is not to be used until Violet is of age.
  </p>
  <p key="87e002c2-a6b8-4582-a0fe-2f449df79312">
   He has used child abuse; for example, he refers to the Baudelaires as "orphans" and "brats", gives them a pile of rocks as toys, he slapped Klaus' face for not serving him roast beef, locks the children in their bedroom where they sleep on one bed, treats them like slaves, traps Sunny in a birdcage and hung her in a tower and threatened to drop it, and has threatened death and murder on the orphans, their relatives and their friends.

   , under the dinner table, he gently rubs the blade of his knife against Violet's knee for their entire meal, just to make her feel scared and terrible, and perhaps indulge in the feeling he has power over her. Klaus has called him a "terrible man" while Violet called him a "monster".
  </p>
  <p key="7f09e3be-f5ab-4830-9f2b-bb4fda845675">
   Olaf is a heavy meat eater, a carnist, and someone who does not seem to care about animal welfare, like Esmé. He does not think a meal is complete without roast beef and apparently thinks it's a given for dinner, becoming violent when the Baudelaires tell him they did not prepare beef. In the TV series, he asks Violet if she's ever hunted to which she replies, "Of course not." Olaf implies he enjoys hunting and says that if she did hunt, she would be familiar with watching the fear and horror in an animal's eyes before their death. He uses the phrase "it gives its life to you", as if he believes animals consciously give consent to being killed. Asides from burning ants as a child, in

  <p key="1e92918e-c7d0-423c-8ba1-07d54d4855d1">
   Olaf can be perceived as a drunk, as he is often mentioned drinking wine and the Baudelaires mention he constantly drinks, even having wine for breakfast once.
  </p>
  <p key="d8440f07-9756-4a70-adf4-3d257e56c587">
   In the film and TV series, Olaf is portrayed as dumbed down as opposed to intelligent; for example, in the book, Olaf tells Klaus he knows what "nuptial" means, while in the TV series, he thinks "knowledge" begins with an "n". However, Olaf was probably born in the early 20th century when literacy was not as common, so one can't fault Olaf too much for this. Live action Olaf has a more comedic tone instead of the sinister and serious tone Olaf has in the novels. He is also much more animated with body language in these adaptations. Despite not being as intelligent as his book divergent, Olaf still has his moments. He is far more intelligent than most of the adults in the film, as he has fooled them time and time again (although this is mainly because of the people being rather gullible), and was able to recognize the Baudelaires when they disguised themselves.
  </p>
  <p key="051e4595-da29-44c9-8ed9-bcd002399f50">
   In the TV series' second season, Olaf begins to gradually become much more dark and violent, due to his plans repeatedly failing, and lusts to murder the children most horrifically as retribution for their success over his schemes. This can be seen as following more closely to the source material.
  </p>
  <p key="033d6a1a-6760-4722-94f6-019cc66708b6">
   Considering Olaf as a whole, Olaf could be perceived as somewhat mentally unstable. Apart from sociopathy/psychopathy, he is also very narcissistic, frequently praising and congratulating himself, and is the self-proclaimed "world's greatest actor." This implies he has narcissistic personality disorder, perhaps to cope with feelings of worthlessness. He also enjoys putting the Baudelaires down intellectually; for example, when Violet is about to say "Don't be absurd..." but does not finish with "surd" because of uncertainty, he tells her that only a stupid person would say a word like 'ab.'
  </p>
  <p key="675f9050-eaef-4fae-81f5-66368eb20c4b">
   Depending on reader interpretation, Olaf may not be past the point of redemption. One could imagine he has a better side. Two examples of this are when he hesitated to kill Dewey, replying, "What else can I do?" (or "It's all I know how to do" in the TV series) and he also saved Kit and helped assist her pregnancy. It is also implied he had a compassionate side with Kit Snicket and his other love interests.

   . The letter explained that a member which he only referred to as O was acting in such a violent manner that his actions have caused the organization to split in two. As the members of the organization often use the first letter of their names to talk about one and another, it is generally assumed O stands for Olaf. Many members of V.F.D., such as Widdershins, often use Olaf's name immediately when talking about the treachery of the fire starting side of the schism. This hints that Olaf has done a great deal of harm to V.F.D. more than most of the other villains involved have, furthering the concept of him being one of the leaders of the schism. However, it should be noted that Kit and Dewey claim the schism occurred when they were four years old; as Olaf is around their and Lemony's age, he would scarcely be old enough to begin the initial schism, though as an adult he could have advanced it.

   Olaf was involved with the organization for many years and knows many, if not all, of the secrets surrounding the organization that the Baudelaire children seek to know. He is also responsible for numerous fires and deaths of V.F.D., as mentioned by Lemony Snicket himself, and plans on gaining control of all the fortunes of the members in thirst of revenge.

Klaus replied that only had one bed, prompting Olaf to reply that they could use their fortune to buy another one. Klaus reminded Olaf that they can't use it until Violet is of age. Olaf then struck Klaus' face for back talking, slapping him hard enough that he fell to the floor and a bruise remained the next day. The children complained to Mr. Poe, calling Olaf a madman, but Poe did not care and dismissed their complaints.

   One morning, Olaf revealed Mr. Poe blabbed to him about their visit. Olaf apologized for being "standoffish" and gave the children oatmeal with raspberries. Violet and Klaus suspected the raspberries may be poison berries, so Olaf ate one to prove it was safe. While the children ate the breakfast, Olaf asked them to participate in a play called "

  </p>
  <p key="54a274ae-3cdf-4a4c-8269-31619989fd5d">
   To ensure that the children cooperate with the plan, Olaf kidnapped Sunny and had her tied up, mouth taped, put in a birdcage, and hung outside his tower window, threatening to murder her if the children refused to be in the play. Violet constructed a makeshift grappling hook and used it to climb up the tower. She found the hook-handed man (a member of Olaf's theatre troupe) waiting to capture her. Klaus was brought up to the tower and they were locked together in the room until the play began.

   The plan to marry Violet Baudelaire to gain the inheritance went awry. Violet managed to thwart Olaf's plan by signing the marriage with her left hand instead of her right, which as she was right-handed, was the required one to make it legally binding. Olaf was exposed as a criminal and fled, but not before promising to Violet that he would get his hands on her fortune no matter what and then murder her and her siblings with his bare hands, making her emit a cry of terror.

   The Baudelaires and Count Olaf are trapped on a boat heading away from the Hotel Denouement and to the sea. The Baudelaires were forced to listen to Count Olaf brag about how he had triumphed and how successful he was. He mentioned he intended to purchase a car with their fortune and ordered them to take him to the nearest luxury car dealership, despite that they were stranded in the middle of an ocean.

   Olaf is soon forced to enter a bird cage as the prisoner of the islanders, which is ironic after what he once did to Sunny. Olaf's personality becomes significantly different as he is seen as more timid, desperate and depressed. This is probably because none of his past methods and tactics work on the islanders and that there is truly no place for him on the island. Olaf is also shown to sympathize with the children, telling them that life is unfair and a miserable place. He seemed to have gained a reluctant respect for them, calling them his new henchmen and even attempting to convince them to escape with him.

   The Baudelaires accused Count Olaf of making them orphans, a suspicion that all three siblings had kept in their hearts for as long as they can remember. Count Olaf, however, upon asking the Baudelaires if that's what they think and receiving Sunny's cold answer, "We

   , fired a harpoon at Olaf (as Olaf planned) only for it to hit the encased Mycelium against his stomach and causing it to burst so that its deadly spores are released into the air, contaminating all of the islanders as well as Olaf himself. Olaf started laughing, stating that Ishmael has murdered everyone on the island as he has just released a deadly fungus into the air.

  <p key="345c34c1-f020-4c57-921c-48ad397e9f7e">
   Olaf realized that he has nothing left to live for, having lost all his henchmen, his parents, his girlfriend, his true love, all his plans ruined, and no chance of obtaining the Baudelaire fortune or any other one for that matter. Too depressed to go on living, the Baudelaire orphans need Olaf’s help but at first he refused to take a specially produced apple (which is mixed with horseradish, the cure for the Mycelium), saying that he has lost everything important to him. However, upon finding out that Kit Snicket is going into labor, he eats the healing apple and carries her to where she can better-perform childbirth, thus performing what Violet calls the one good deed in his life, during which he surprisingly kisses Kit on the lips, hinting at a past relationship between the two.

   Although Count Olaf was cured from the Medusoid Mycelium, he was still dying from the harpoon wound. He looked at the Baudelaire orphans in pain and helped them bring Kit on to the beach who seems to be dying from the fungus. The Baudelaires helped Kit give birth when she recited the poem "The Night Has a Thousand Eyes" by Francis William Bourdillon which is answered by Olaf reciting the final stanza of Philip Larkins's "This Be the Verse".

   Count is a title in European countries for a noble of varying status. It is unknown why he is "Count" Olaf. "Count" may be a self-proclaimed title he gave himself, as he is a very narcissistic character. People thought of as "royalty" have also tended to be very wealthy throughout history, although Olaf is implied to live in near poverty, so "Count" may also be a parody of his financial wealth, or technically speaking, lack of.

      Olaf has also been theorized by many readers to be an ephebophile, due to his interactions with Violet. Kit Snicket also seems considerably younger than he is, supporting he prefers women on the young side. Despite the fortune being his main incentive for the play, it is possible that Olaf actually preferred a marriage with Violet, enjoyed the idea of being her husband and seriously planned on living with his "countess" for the rest of his life. He says, "Now, if all of you will excuse me, my bride and I need to go home for our wedding night." In

    Olaf may have knowledge of Italian. When the Baudelaires announce they are serving pasta puttanesca, Olaf replies, "What did you call me?" The name translates to "sauce in the style of the prostitute" or "whore's spaghetti". Italian legend has it that this dish was named as such because it was the everyday prostitutes signature dish, due to the affordability of its ingredients and how 'easy' it is to make. Later, when he is disguised as Stephano, he claims to be an Italian man.

    Olaf attempts to kill the orphans with a train and frame it as an accident, making it seem like it contradicts his motives as Olaf needs at least one of them alive, preferably Violet, to inherit the Baudelaire fortune. However, Olaf has the misconception that he would inherit the fortune if all of them died. His play was originally titled The Marvelous Carriage, and the plot involved the real deaths of the Baudelaire children by being fatally struck by a carriage in an "accident". After finding out from Mr. Poe that the children's death would not deem him eligible for a claim to the Baudelaire fortune, he renamed and completely rewrote the play into The Marvelous Marriage.
