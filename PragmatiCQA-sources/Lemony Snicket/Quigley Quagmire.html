   He is cordial like his siblings, and remains incredibly optimistic despite the hardships he has been put through as a result of his parent's affiliation. Unfortunately, he can be a little too trusting, to the point of naïveté; he states that he believes "well-read people are less likely to be evil," and immediately trusts and obeys Jacques Snicket following the man displaying intelligence and telling him that he knew his parents, despite Jacques also ordering him to stay hidden and isolated and not to attempt to contact his siblings. He is puzzled by the secrets his parents and the other members of V.F.D. choose to keep from him but his penchant towards trust leads him to follow their directions anyway. Quigley believes that everyone and everything has secrets if one scrutinizes enough.
