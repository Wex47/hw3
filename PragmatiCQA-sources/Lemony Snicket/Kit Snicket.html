   Upon finding out that Kit is in danger, Count Olaf carries Kit to the beach, during which he surprisingly kisses Kit . In pain during the birth, Kit quotes to Count Olaf an excerpt of a poem written by Francis William Bourdillon: "The night has a thousand eyes, and the day but one; yet the light of the bright world dies with the dying sun. The mind has a thousand eyes, and the heart but one: yet the light of a whole life dies when love is done."

The Baudelaires help Kit give birth and by nightfall, Kit and the Baudelaires rest in a tent. Kit decides to name her Beatrice after the Baudelaires' mother. Despite eating the apple after giving birth, Kit realizes her infection has progressed too far and that she will die from the Medusoid Mycelium anyway. As Kit holds her daughter, she asks the Baudelaires to promise her that they will protect Beatrice so she will not be alone in the world. Kit violently coughs and falls unconscious as she dies. After her death, the Baudelaires bury her on the island with Olaf after writing the letter "K" on a rock to remember her.

    Despite her refusal to take the cure out of concern for her unborn child, Kit consistently engages in behavior and consumes substances that would be harmful or potentially dangerous for the safety of her child. In the books, Kit consumes two cups of coffee in quick succession at her picnic with the Baudelaires, and later references having "just" had Turkish coffee with Thursday. Caffeine is shown to have negative effects on fetuses, although Kit may not be aware of this given the series is set in a less contemporary era. Kit also water skiis to the Queequeg. In both the books and the show, Kit engages in extremely reckless driving, although sometimes she is being chased. In the show, Kit does not wear a seat belt while driving.

If she washed up on The Island the morning after/of the storm, she would have given birth the next day, making her death, Beatrice's birth, and Decision Day happen on January 28. However, the calendar's canonicity has been controversial, and it is also unknown exactly when she was reported missing, so this is not certain.

    Kit's depiction in the Netflix adaptation has stirred up some controversy among the fanbase. While it is generally agreed that Allison Williams is a fine actress, there was concern for her age, as she was twenty-nine while filming. The issue with that being that Kit is the twin of Jacques Snicket, whose actor was in his forties while filming. This sparked anger over whether Kit was intentionally cast and dressed younger due to the Hollywood standard of refusing to cast older women due to sexism.

    's claim that he cast Williams due to her seeming like Kit was met with derision due to his exact quote. He says, "She's sporty, she's smart, she's sassy, she's self-confident, and she's beautiful, which are all the attributes Kit has."
    The attributes listed, aside from "smart," barely describe the Kit of the books, who is chronically depressed, distraught and guilt-ridden, described as looking tired and weary, and has never been described as "sporty."
