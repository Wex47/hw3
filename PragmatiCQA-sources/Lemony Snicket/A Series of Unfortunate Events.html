   could be seen as a parody of children's literature or pseudo-children's literature. For example, there is a lot of mature content and characters dying in horrible ways. These include: People dying in fires, being poisoned, drowned in a swamp, being eaten by leeches, almost being buzzsawed to death or gored by lions, and Lemony Snicket is the type of who uses complicated language that many people wouldn't know, such as "augmented", "furtive", "rivulets", "verdant", "accoutrement", etc. In addition, the child protagonists of the series are often portrayed as being intelligent and more mature and "adult-ish" than many of the actual adults in the series. Some of the humor in the series may also be lost on less knowledgeable audiences; for example, in the TV series, Monty asks Stephano where he studied herpetology, and Stephano replies that he does not know anything about sores, which is a joke about herpes.

  </p>
  <p key="ddd74f1f-f7fa-4508-9ff4-5b6adeca887a">
   Some have classified it into specific genres such as: gothic fiction, or some variety thereof, whether it is mock-gothic, a satire of gothic literature, neo-Victorian or "suburban gothic". There are also some slight steampunk elements.
  </p>
  <p key="6cf1b5c2-e6c7-46cb-b312-8411b1fbd96d">
   Another genre that the series has been described as is absurdist fiction, because of its strange characters, improbable storylines, and black comedy due to the morbid nature of the series.
  </p>
  <p key="da098f6a-5176-4dd1-a9f0-197279e7e240">
   Others have classified this as surrealistic fiction because of the fact that the events in the books could happen to unlucky people, even if it doesn't seem like it. The books often have a wonky and creepy existentialist vibe to them, exemplified by all the strangeness and oddities the Baudelaires encounter, giving them a surreal, unsettling, alien or otherworldly vibe. This can make the series feel like a strange dream or nightmare.
  </p>
  <p key="b9f3b49e-a09f-4165-836b-28a0dac06547">
   Some have categorized the series as "horror" and "suspense", due to the amount of suspense, danger, death, violence, dread and tension in some of them.

   Characterized by Victorian Gothic tones and absurdist textuality, the books are noted for their whimsical dark humor, sarcastic storytelling, and anachronistic elements, as well as frequent cultural and literary allusions. They have been classified as postmodern and metafictional writing, with the plot evolution throughout the later novels being cited as an exploration of the psychological process of transition from the idyllic innocence of childhood to the moral complexity of maturity.

   is set in an unusual, anachronistic time period that is ambiguously set sometime in the 20th century, with old and new inventions used. A variety of inventions and technology are mentioned. For example, there are helicopters, cars, phones, a microphone, and an advanced school computer (in the TV series, the computer looks like a computer from the 1990s and early 2000s). At another point, typewriters, telegrams, and carriages pulled by horses appear. This paints a very changing landscape of an industrial time, with technology not yet homogenized in all places in the series. In addition, the Baudelaire children are illustrated wearing very Victorian-era clothing.

   The 2004 film, however, is an exception. During a courtroom scene where a judge grants Count Olaf custody of the orphans, an American flag is present. In the finale, a letter addressed to the Baudelaires mentions the city is Boston, Massachusetts, meaning the Baudelaires are American in at least this continuity.

   The ambiguity of both the time and the setting are likely intentional decisions by Daniel Handler, who when asked, said, "A Series of Unfortunate Events takes place in the city and regions surrounding it, during the week and sometimes on weekends. All The Wrong Questions takes place earlier, in a smaller town."

   is also depicted as being full of diverse and multicultural mentions, from its locations, food, language and people. For example, Peru is mentioned in the second book, a Vietnamese restaurant is mentioned in the sixth, Hector may be of Hispanic descent as he cooks Mexican food in book seven, there is an Indian restaurant in book twelve, etc. Charles and Sir in book four are heavily implied to be a gay couple. There are mentions of rabbis throughout the series and different religions, traditions and culture. Handler also wanted a more ethnically diverse cast in the TV series.

   The series focused on Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire. Violet has a talent for inventing, Klaus has a talent for reading, and Sunny has a talent for biting (though she is later shown to have a talent for cooking). While they are portrayed very intelligent children, they are not perfect "superhumans" and have their own flaws. For example, Violet can overlook the obvious and doesn't know what leeches are, Klaus can be rude and doesn't know what a "xenophobe" means, etc. Sunny could be considered a superhuman to a degree, as she is a baby who has a sword fight with her teeth in the fourth book and climbs up an elevator shaft with her teeth in the sixth. They may also be interpreted as a tiny bit spoiled, as they later complain about doing chores for Count Olaf, although he did force them to do so and treated them like slaves.

However, it is set in a conventional setting without any war, famine, etc (where the Baudelaires live, at least). Most of the dystopic elements are often found in sociology, human behavior and often barbaric and nonsensical laws which humanity follows obediently and submissively, and the vast majority of people lack critical thinking skills.

This is very confusing as Sunny is not even able to perform half of the things a secretary could actually do such as stapling, picking up the telephone, etc. Along with this there are many other confusing things as well: Students are also forced to listen to Nero play the violin horridly for 6 hours each night. If they fail to listen to his recital, they are forced to give Nero a bag of candy. If students go to the administration building without an appointment they can't use silverware at meals. Other punishments include having their beverages served in large puddles, having their hands tied behind their backs, and eating their food as a dog. One might wonder if these punishments are even legal considering how the surface of tables would contaminate the food and drink with grime.

   , but they were interested in him writing a story for children. Handler thought it was a terrible idea at first, but met with the publishers to discuss the book. They challenged him to write the book he wished he could have read when he was 10.
  </p>
  <p key="e1c7aec6-de67-4d71-8fbf-300f15c8f1c9">
   He retooled a manuscript he had for a mock-Gothic book for adults,
   which became "the story of children growing through all these terrible things", a concept which the publishers liked, to Handler's surprise.
  </p>
  <p key="efb4c5ec-67be-4326-b76f-6c90109e99cd">
   When asked what inspired him to write the series, Handler said, "I thought it would be interesting if terrible things happened to three helpless children over and over again."
  </p>
  <p key="78733575-b673-4075-889b-a9987097e3a5">
   Handler was not heavily focused on a moral message while writing the series, although he was forced to think about this aspect at times. Instead, he preferred to focus on the actual events of the plot instead of trying to craft the story around a moral message which could seem shoehorned and forced.
  </p>
  <p key="71e67db5-87ca-4c39-a2a0-9f380f454a1e">
   Handler was inspired by authors like Roald Dahl, Edward Gorey and Zilpha Keatley Snyder, who wrote books about creepy but nonsupernatural circumstances. He did not want to write a book about people casting spells or finding three rings to defeat a dragon. His original contract was four books, so if his series was not successful, it would have stopped at

   Daniel Handler admits that he wrote the series because he was sick of how "sappy", "dumbed down" and "optimistic" children's books are, as they tend to always have happy endings, be overtly cheerful and uplifting, and give unrealistic expectations. Handler was inspired to write the series after watching news stories on TV about the lives of unfortunate children around the world.

Adding to the phenomenon to the success of the series were mysteries such as the anonymity of Lemony Snicket, due to his identity as Daniel Handler being unknown to the vast majority of people at the time, as well as the uncertain ultimate fate of the Baudelaires, leading to mass speculation and theorizing.

   Although the first few books were criticized and notorious due to their controversial aspects, they gradually gained a cult following over the years as the series continued, leading to the 2004 feature film being produced only a few years after their initial launch, which boosted the popularity of the series further. This also led to a full Netflix adaptation of all thirteen books in 2017, which had a similar effect.

  <p key="3f078f97-5bc0-4786-a99d-93fb47f630eb">
   Fans often claim the books are intelligently written, humorous, full of interesting plot twists, engaging mysteries, cliff hangers, complex characters, and themes which force the reader to question their own morality with heavy grey-on-grey morality.
  </p>
  <p key="4c23a6d1-af84-4af4-9675-fded4f22edad">
   In regards to the children who read the series, the books have often been categorized as "coming-of-age" stories, and are in the "Growing Up &amp; Facts of Life" section on Amazon.com. The Baudelaires go through a lot of character growth; they start off as wealthy and innocent and somewhat naive children who are dependent on their parents and after their parents die, the Baudelaires are unable to rely on their money and live in many dismal and impoverished circumstances. They gradually learn about the horrors and corruption in their world and, by the end, have become incredibly strong, brave, outspoken and mature teenagers. The Times Online refer to the books as "a literary phenomenon", and discuss how the plight of the Baudelaire orphans helps children cope with loss—citing the rise in sales post September 11, 2001 as evidence. A fan article compares the series to being a "guide for grief."

   The series can help teach children critical thinking skills, such as skepticism, as well as a wide variety of vocabulary. Others noted that it can help children to become more independent and learn how to not only voice their own values, but also act on them, due to the themes about the consequences of inaction and complacency, even when it seems the whole world is against them.

   In addition, the books may help to generate sympathy and understanding towards those who are unfortunate in life. The reader is forced to experience the constant tragedy of the Baudelaire orphans. For example, in

   has received its fair share of criticism.
  </p>
  <p key="67ff1754-5c32-4ef5-a7d2-d47ca4425d97">
   The series has been criticized for formulaic and repetitive storytelling. Similar events occur repeatedly. In Books 1-7, the Baudelaires appear with a new guardian, Count Olaf appears in a disguise, no one believes the Baudelaires, someone is killed or almost killed, and Olaf escapes. In defense, the formula being recycled makes

   and the latter books more dramatic. Another example of repetitiveness is that when someone says something, "cried" is often used as a descriptor, such as "Violet cried, 'It wasn't us!'"
  </p>
  <p key="bde41ca6-17c9-4ff1-83a6-b69a93e76c25">
   Lemony Snicket constantly defines words, even ones such as "rickety", "blanched" and "simmered". In defense, this is meant for the younger readers who probably do not have a large vocabulary. Handler appears to have taken this criticism seriously during development, in order to balance the story so younger readers know what is occurring, while at the same time, trying not to come off as too patronizing and condescending to older readers. In later books, definitions are moreso used in a fashion to describe the events that are unfolding, rather than the specific definition itself.
  </p>
  <p key="c8ea6e89-8149-4bc9-be25-89075f900b39">
   Some claim and criticize that the books teach children to not trust adults and that it's useless to come to them for help. The series portrays young people (the Baudelaires, the Quagmires, Fiona) as being more sensible and open-minded than the often irrational adults, even going so far to include a nightmarish village run by 25 nonsensical elderly people (the

   . However, another interpretation is that it teaches children to be wary of certain adults instead of all adults, and the idea of why blindly respecting and trusting someone, simply because they are older than you, can be a bad idea.
  </p>
  <p key="c700a542-c3c9-491a-90a6-021e252126df">
   A woman also once approached Daniel Handler and said, "In one of your books, you teach that it is sometimes necessary to lie."
   The books do not always portray "honesty as the best policy", showing how at times, not telling the truth is sometimes can be the better option, and why dishonesty can help. For example, the Baudelaires decide to build a trap for Esmé Squalor in order to rescue Sunny, but Quigley has a moral dilemma and decides to be honest. Esmé calls him an idiot for telling her they built a trap, and this begins a chain dangerous of events occur which almost leads to Sunny being thrown off a mountain to her death, because Quigley thought being honest is the "right" thing to do.

  <p key="23824cf9-fde8-4789-9bfb-665562eafe1c">
   The series contains elements of "moral ambivalence", often dismissing the idea of "right" and "wrong". For example, at the end of

  </p>
  <p key="1dbdd45c-c5f1-4091-974c-e5d1a34088be">
   While the series features some developed characters, it has also been criticized for keeping some characters rather one note. Two developed villains are the Hook-Handed Man and White-Faced Women, who eventually change their ways and leave Olaf. In contrast, Esmé Squalor and Carmelita Spats are introduced as selfish and bratty and go through little character growth. However, one-note characters can be a positive thing, in the sense that they portray the truth that some people will never change.

   has come under criticism from both parents and some school districts for its dark themes. Upon its release, many were quick to deem the series as "sick" and "demented", due to the often overwhelming feelings of despair, children under constant threats of death and violence, people dying in gruesome ways, etc. This was especially true during the time when only books 1-4 were released, in which someone explicitly dies.

  <p key="563e479e-e58e-4c6a-8fc5-a100a3e45e3c">
   The finale of book 5 is perhaps the first turning point of the series; while Duncan is being kidnapped, he shouts "V.F.D.!" which adds a heavy sense of mystery, and the series begins to introduce increasingly complex themes and heavier social commentary. Although book 4 had commentary about corruption in the workforce, the latter books contain social commentary on corruption in aspects like education (book 5), fashion and wealth (book 6), herd mentality (book 7), healthcare (book 8) and entertainment (book 9).
