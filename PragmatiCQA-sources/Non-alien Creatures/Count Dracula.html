   Although this isn't completely explicit in the book (only speculated), the character of Dracula was partially based on - and is commonly equated with - the cruel 15th century Wallachian prince Vlad III; better known by the nickname Vlad the Impaler, and it's very likely that they're intended to be viewed as the same.

   In his first appearance, Dracula is described as an old man with a fearful semblance and white mustache. As a shapeshifter, he can also achieve a more youthful appearance, but his bestial nature is betrayed by some features such as pointed ears and teeth as well as hair on his hand palms.

   Dracula's abilities include: hypnotic suggestions, shapeshifting into a wolf, dog, bat, or mist; and the ability to crawl on the walls like a gecko. Besides not being reflected on mirrors, vampires in Stoker's novel seem to interact (or rather not interact) with light in strange ways, as they cast no shadow and flames can be visible through their bodies. They're also capable of establishing psychic links with people whose blood they have fed upon.

   Furthermore, according to Van Helsing, the vampire is stronger than 20 men and capable of controlling the weather, giving commands to all sorts of animals, changing sizes and even disappearing occasionally. They are vulnerable to sunlight, crosses and garlic; and need to sleep on soil from their homeland in order to maintain their strength. Although they're creatures of the night, they aren't directly harmed by the sun, only weakened by it, and unable to shapeshift during the day.

    Lucy Westenra
   </a>
   (who is the best friend of Harker's fiancée), she's afflicted with a strange disease and dies, only to rise from her grave as a vampire and start feeding on the blood of children at night.

   The Dutch physician and connoisseur of the occult, Prof. Abraham Van Helsing, who had been called to treat Miss Westenra before her death, recognizes the symptoms of vampirism and, along with Dr. Seward, Harker and two other comrades, opens up Lucy's grave and decapitates her, putting an end to the vampire curse. They also manage to break into Dracula's property and destroy his boxes of Transylvanian soil, forcing him to move back to his homeland.

   However, Dracula at this point has also fed on the blood of Harker's fiancée Mina Murray, and the only way to prevent her from having the same fate as Lucy is to destroy the vampire who infected her. With this goal in mind the party follows Dracula back to Europe, using the psychic link created on his victims to their advantage as Van Helsing manages to hypnotize Mina and ask her about the Count's whereabouts. When they finally meet him, they damage his throat and his heart, killing him and causing his body to turn to dust; but not before revealing a peaceful semblance on his face, suggesting that his soul is now in peace as his humanity has been restored upon death.

   , Dracula promotes the annual Monster Road Rally, held in his native Transylvania. In 1988, he claimed the event was in its 753rd edition, which means it's being held since 1235 at least (proving that this Dracula is older than Vlad III). Competitors driving in the 753rd edition of the rally include:
