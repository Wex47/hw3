   firmly places these creatures in India (along with other strange species such as the
   Sciapods
   ). Ctesias describes the Cynocephali as inhabiting caves in the Indian mountains "as far as the river Indos", wearing clothes made from the skin of wild animals, eating raw meet (although they leave it under the sun to dry) and being "extremely just, like the rest of the Indians with whom they associate". Although they understand the languages spoken by humans in India, they are incapable of speaking them and instead communicate with each other by barking. Physically, they're described with dark skin, large teeth (larger than those of a common dog) and nails that are similar to a dog's claws except for being longer and rounder. Their tails are also longer and hairier than dog tails, and they are very swift hunters, skilled with the bow-and-arrow. They live longer than humans, having an average lifespan of about 170 or even 200 years. The Indians refer to them as

      They also rear numbers of sheep, goats, and asses, drinking the milk of the sheep and whey made from it. They eat the fruit of the Siptachora, whence amber is procured, since it is sweet. They also dry it and keep it in baskets, as the Greeks keep their dried grapes. They make rafts which they load with this fruit together with well-cleaned purple flowers and 260 talents of amber, with the same quantity of the purple dye, and 1000 additional talents of amber, which they send annually to the king of India. They exchange the rest for bread, flour, and cotton stuffs with the Indians, from whom they also buy swords for hunting wild beasts, bows, and arrows, being very skillful in drawing the bow and hurling the spear. They cannot be defeated in war, since they inhabit lofty and inaccessible mountains. Every five years the king sends them a present of 300,000 bows, as many spears, 120,000 shields, and 50,000 swords.

   Roman authors such as Pliny the Elder and Claudius Aelianus also give a closely-matching description of the Cynocephali's culture, even though they place them in Africa, rather than India. It's worth-noting that Aelianus still regarded these creatures as mere animals, due to their "inarticulate" and "unintelligible" speech, even though he acknowledges that they're intelligent, practice agriculture and animal husbandry, understand human speech and do not attack people. Similarly, St. Isidore of Seville would also classify them as beasts, rather than people.

  <p key="dfee09b4-3ed0-4bc9-9842-a0768c8059bf">
   The question of whether Cynocephali and other fantastic races should be regarded as human or animal also interested other Christian authors such as St. Augustine of Hippo, who argued that, if human, they're to be considered descendants of Adam. This matter was important, because if such races were to be regarded as humans, missionaries who encountered them should preach the Gospels to them, but if they were to be regarded as animals, such would be pointless. Many people believed that creatures like these, although fierce and bestial, could still be redeemed and have their souls saved. This idea culminated in the traditional representations of
   St. Christopher
   as a Cynocephalus, who became human after converting. However, some scholars have argued that this backstory for St. Christopher seems to have originated from a translation error, in which the Latin term
   <i key="37949f12-fc4c-4cb6-8172-80331c3d3706">

   (dog-like).

   Although the Greek and Roman descriptions of Cynocephali typically portrayed them as noble and usually not hostile towards humans (though the Argonauts did have to battle them, as did Alexander), this picture slowly changed with time, to the point that Medieval authors would typically regard them as brutal savages who feasted upon human meat at the slightest chance. At the same time, the geographical origin of the dog-headed ones continued to change, with some sources - notably the Arthurian legends - placing them on Europe rather than Asia. According to the
   <i key="8c99fdaf-bafe-4063-a574-50ea7122df74">
    Speculum Maius
   </i>
   , by Vincent of Beauvais, it's possible that a Cynocephalus was at some point present in the court of St. Louis IX of France. Beauvais describes the creature's disposition as variable: "when peaceful, he is tender like a man, when furious, he becomes cruel and retaliates on humankind".

Battuta describes them as a "vile race" which has no religion and practices polygyny, each men having up to 30 wives. The fact that the females appear human is interesting, in that other authors, including Alexander, have claimed that the Cynocephali often abduct human females and mate with them. Some sources even claimed that they regularly mate with the legendary
   Amazons
   tribe, and that the female (human) babies born from such unions were raised by the Amazons whereas the male (dog-headed) ones were raised by the Cynocephali. Still, it is clear that female Cynocephali do exist according to sources ranging from Ctesias to John Mandeville, among many others. Interestingly, the Oghuz Khagan Narratives did describe Itbarak females as "pretty".
