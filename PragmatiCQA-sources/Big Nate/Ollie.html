    Mrs. Godfrey's
   </a>
   cat, though little else is known about him. He hasn't really been seen in the books. He is featured in
   Big Nate: Revenge of the Cream Puffs
   . He is known to be very docile with people. He was too scared to be left at home when there were construction workers so Mrs.Godfrey brought her to work. Nate is afraid of cats so Mrs.Godfrey took her away from Nate but Nate was still worried because he thought she would jump across the room and slash his neck...
