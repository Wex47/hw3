   Chester's face was never seen because the author said he would be too hard to draw, but it is said that he has a mustache and tattoos. When he appears, his arm and/or legs are usually the only part of him that is shown. His face has also been said to be a combination of King Kong and another famous fictional gorilla. It was also observed by Nate that Chester's knuckles drag on the ground even while standing up straight.

   Chester is not entirely a school bully, but simply is an overgrown student who is insecure, doesn't want to be bothered, and sensitive, has no control over his actions whatsoever, and is easily provoked. When Nate asked him to borrow a pencil, Chester shoved him into a garbage can. Chester's personality is commonly known as a ruthless, hot-headed, easily-tempered person. He is referred to as "a psycho," and is easily aggravated by things, such as his weight, people annoying him, people telling him what to do and people touching him.

   he is seen in detention along with Nate, Seth Quincy, and Lee Ann Pfister but it was only his body and not the face.

   He is also known for stuffing kids in trash cans and being in detention with Nate.
He once stuffed Nate into a 2-liter soda bottle when Nate tried to hit him on his head. He can be so mean that he will try to even stuff a kid into a desk.

   . This also grants him superior dodgeball skills. Nate claimed that he throws the ball at one billion miles per hour, though this is obviously an exaggeration. Chester's outrageous throwing strength might also be what led to the ban of Dodgeball.
