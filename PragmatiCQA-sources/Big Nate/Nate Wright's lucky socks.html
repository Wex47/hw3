    lucky socks
   </b>
   were a regular pair of socks that he claims to be lucky. He refuses to wash them, or else they will, according to Nate, "lose their luck." He always wears them while playing sports and for tests for good luck. They are very dirty and smelly to everyone, but Nate claims that never washing lucky socks are what keeps them lucky. He even set up a little booth where he put a sign that says "Rub my lucky socks... 50 cents". Nate questioned why his business was so slow. When buying new socks the store clerk thought that they were gray.

    washed them, Nate was very angry at him. Before being washed, according to Nate, they were “grayish, yellowish, and brownish with some green in it. After being washed, it went back to its original color, white, at the cost of all its luck being washed out. However, when Nate was at a back to school sale, the socks were gray. Showing that he gets his socks "lucky" really quick.

    tried to throw them out. In this strip they appear to be a light green color, probably due to various forms of mold, dirt and grime. In
