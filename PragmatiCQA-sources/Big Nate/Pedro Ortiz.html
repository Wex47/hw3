   Pedro Ortiz was most likely born in
   Puerto Rico
   and grew up with his brother, Mr. Ortiz. After moving to the
   United States
   , he lived in a walking distance to
   his brother's family
   and friends. His nephew, Teddy, introduced him to his friends at one point, and Pedro became known for his skill in hypnosis, as he hypnotized
   Mr. Holloway
   to find fried chicken repulsive and

   he would keep safe, he got mad and blamed Nate that he "lost" the camera as a result of his untidiness. In an effort to become neat, Nate visited Pedro's house with Teddy to get hypnotized into getting neat. Pedro performed a card trick in front of him, and Nate was baffled. The trick worked, as Nate instantly became neater.

   Soon after, Pedro embarked on a trip to
