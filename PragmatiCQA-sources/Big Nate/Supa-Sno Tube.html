   , and Teddy used it to sled down
   Cluffy's Cliff
   until Nolan and his gang showed up and snatched it from them. Teddy claimed that the tube can only hold two people at once, but the group sledded on it anyway. When they caught air by going over the first bump, it popped when they landed again.

   The bullies then flounced off as the trio miserably consulted the damage. It is unknown if Teddy replaced it or patched it, and Nate said he thought it was beyond patching.

    Nate once brought a Supa-Sno Tube to the party store and had them fill it up with helium. When he used it to go off a ramp, the tube went into a tree and popped.

    Nate was also seen with a Supa-Sno Tube when he, Francis and Teddy went sledding in twenty-degree weather.
