    Guess That Baby
   </b>
   is a guessing game that
    Mrs. Shipulski
    put onto the bulletin board. The game consisted of every student's baby pictures, and the goal of the game was to guess who's picture was who, when they were a baby.

    When Nate walked into the school secretary's office, she saw a picture of two of the toddlers. Nate asked who it was, and Mrs. Shipulski explained that it was her sister and her when they were young. Nate said that he wouldn't have ever guessed that, which gave Mrs. Shipulski the idea for the game. Nate had made a comic for that event happening.
