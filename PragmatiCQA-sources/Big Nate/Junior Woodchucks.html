   used to be members before they changed the name to "Timber Scouts". It was named the Junior Woodchucks from 1995 to 2010, when they changed the name. Nate was officially declared a Junior Woodchuck on
   . Francis was officially declared a Junior Woodchuck at an unknown time but before Nate. Teddy was officially declared a Junior Woodchuck sometime between
   and
   . It is mentioned in
   Big Nate On a Roll
   that Teddy joined the Timber Scouts before Nate, but since the novel universe is unparalleled to the comic strip universe, in the comics Nate and Teddy probably joined the Timber Scouts at the same time, with Francis, when the Junior Woodchucks were renamed the Timber Scouts in 2010. There is debate about when the Junior Woodchucks were renamed the Timber Scouts. The last appearance of Nate as a Junior Woodchuck was on
   , and the first time the Timber Scouts were mentioned was on
   . However, in the first ever mention of the Timber Scouts,
   Chad
   said "...Last year's performance at our Timber Scout meeting..." Which was implying that the Timber Scouts had been around for a year before that. But that can't be true, as the last time the Junior Woodchucks were mentioned was only 4 months before. We only can say that

   , the creator of
   Big Nate
   , made a mistake, and the Junior Woodchucks were renamed the Timber Scouts between August 7, 2010 and December 9, 2010. Another theory is that, because the name Junior Woodchucks was based off of the scout troop from Disney’s Ducktales,
