   , the antagonist. The plot of the comics have never been revealed, but it can be assumed that it is very action-oriented because of how Nate describes the comics.

   loves the comic series, and describes it as "the best comic in the universe". It is possible that, because she is ''good looking'', Nate is to focused on her beauty to actually pay attention and just says whatever(ergo using her as his ''eye-candy''). He usually buys an issue for five dollars at his local comic shop,

   doesn't approve of it though, as he thinks it's violent and suggestive. Though he thinks it's provocative at times, he is seen begging to read it or even stealing it wherever Nate left it. Both Nate and his father have a crush on Femme Fatality. She has very "thin" clothes.
