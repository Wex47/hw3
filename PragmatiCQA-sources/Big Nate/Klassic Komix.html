   . Nate once thought that he caught a person stealing from the store, when in it was just the store manager -
   Wayne
   . This was seen in
   Big Nate: On a Roll
   . He actually did once catch
   Randy shoplifting a comic
   . Nate has also called Wayne a "caveman" before because of how rough he looks with the beard and his mumbling. Nate is an intern at Klassic Comix. Klassic Comix also appeared in Poptropica, on Big Nate Island.
