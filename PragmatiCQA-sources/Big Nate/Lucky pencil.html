   to come, and when Artur rejected, Nate convinced Artur to go with him to Pitch N' Putt. Nate missed almost all of the pitches the pitching machine threw at him, and when Artur pointed that out, Nate said to him, "You think it's so easy, Artur, YOU try it!" Artur reluctantly accepted and said he would be terrible, but it might be fun for him. Artur ended up "hitting rockets all over the place," according to Nate and added that it was lucky that nobody saw that when a pro baseball scout attempted to recruit Artur. Artur probably declined since he doesn't play baseball, but it ended up making Nate more jealous of Artur's luck.

   and Teddy about how annoying it was that Artur was so lucky all the time. Francis remarked that Artur was talented, not fortunate, and Nate replied that he was talented, but he doesn't get all the lucky breaks that Artur does. Nate then said that he had a plan, and that was to find a good luck charm. When Francis asked about Nate's so-called

   was shown lying on the ground saying: "C-Can't breathe". The next day, Nate finally found something he thought might be a good luck charm, a bottle cap that he had in his pocket when he took a math test that he believes he aced. When Francis asked Nate what he put for the test's first question, Nate emphatically answered: "Negative 12!" Which was followed by Francis and Dee Dee laughing their heads off and Nate throwing away the bottle cap and thinking: "The search continues." Later, Teddy suggests using a coin that he found as a good luck charm. Nate rejects the suggestion, saying that the good luck charm needs to find him, not to be chosen by someone else. Even later, Nate finds a cap on the floor and puts it on his head, thinking of it as a potential good luck charm when a kid comes up and says that Nate stole his hat, the kid then clobbered Nate. Finally, Nate found a pencil on the floor of the Social Studies classroom. And when he picked it up,

   Later, Francis said that it probably wasn't the good luck pencil that made Nate do better than he thought he did on a test, and Nate agreed, saying that "A pencil probably doesn't have the power to bring good fortune." Seconds later, Nate finds a 20 dollar bill, which Francis thinks is a coincidence. When Nate shows it to Teddy, he suggests putting it to the test and points to

   , Captain of the Cheer Squad and tells Nate to ask her out. When Nate does that, Belinda (amazingly) accepts, and  Francis and Teddy finally accept that the pencil is lucky. The next day, right before Social Studies, Dee Dee tells Nate and Teddy that Mrs. Godfrey gave a pop quiz to the class before them, and Teddy says: "We're cooked" Nate, however, reminds Teddy and Dee Dee about the lucky pencil as they walk into the classroom. When they enter the classroom, Mrs. Godfrey tells everybody to sit down, making everybody feel like there's going to be a pop quiz until she surprises the class with a popcorn party. Everyone is visibly shocked, and Nate says: "The lucky pencil strikes again!" The next day, Francis asks Nate whether it works for just Nate or if it works for other people. Nate thinks that Francis is trying to get some of the pencil's good luck for himself, so he says: "The pencil is mine! Mine!" When Teddy comes along, Francis remarks that it's like: "sharing a locker with Gollum", referring to the fact that he shares a locker with Nate, as Nate says to the pencil: "You're so beautiful."

Nate becomes distressed, and he quickly finds another pencil and tries to swap that pencil with the lucky pencil. Mr. Galvin tries to assure Nate that the lucky pencil worked fine and that "a pencil's a pencil." seconds before he accidentally snaps the pencil tip, which makes Nate freak out for a second time. As Mr. Galvin goes to sharpen the pencil, Nate begs him not to sharpen it, offering the pencil that he has, but Mr. Galvin waves him away and sharpens the lucky pencil until it's down to a pencil stub. When science is over, Mr. Galvin gives the lucky pencil back to Nate, who finds Chad and tells him what happened. Chad is visibly sad as well and asks whether or not the pencil was still lucky when Belinda Chapman walks up to Nate and tells him that she's changed her mind about going to the movies with him and adds: "I must've been temporarily insane when I said that." When she leaves, Chad says that that was a little mean, while Nate throws away the Lucky Pencil, saying: "Here, have a pencil stub." in a disgruntled manner.
