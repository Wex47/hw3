   , though Nichols had a reason to give Nate detention, he said that it was his fault. Later, Nate got detention during lunch for a "green bean incident".

   In the comic strip, Principal Nichols is mostly seen to be wearing a white shirt with black pants and a tie with a checkered coat. When the strip started being colored his tie colors would sometimes change as would his pants. He is also known to wear glasses. They look like the model of Gina's glasses, only bigger.
