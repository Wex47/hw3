   Vernon Wright was born in Cleveland, Ohio. It is possible that he was worked for the World Wars, which would make sense considering Vernon worked very hard.  He got together in high school with Marge Wright, and attended a dance, who he assumed was Marge, which Marge denied, saying that she went with someone else.

   Marty was born sometime in 1974, and Marty is known to have attended a movie with his friends at least more than once, Marty also was not active, as he claimed to be later on; as Vernon said that he stayed inside to play with Legos. Sometime in Marty's Highschool years, he dated Mindy Glickstein, to Vern's knowledge, is unknown. Eventually, Marty did break up with her. Eventually, sometime in Marty's later life, he dated and married Nate's mother, who divorced him, but still gave birth to two children, Nate Wright and Ellen Wright, making Vern a grandfather.

   In his later life, Vern did become lazier, and was prescribed with pills by his doctor for an unknown cause, though Vern did ignore his health, much to the annoyance of his wife, Marge Wright. Many examples of this are since in the strip, when he admits he had a kidney stone, sometime before 2020.

   asked him if he has any interest in art. This resulted with Vern pulling up his shirt and saying "I've got a tattoo here that is quite a masterpiece". Later on, Vernon became angry with the cashier at a gift shop, since he was expecting them to sell Junior Mints at the gift shop. Marge needed him and eventually tracked him down at a gift shop wanting some Junior Mints®.
