   Dee Dee
   , because Nate Wright broke his wrist after trying to catch

   's donut (not the food kind, mind you, but the one you sit on if you break your tailbone) from

   (however, Nate Wright was the one who came up with the idea for him). Dr. Arch Enemy is not a very big character in the series, and is not shown in the
   Big Nate
   comics. He always messes up Dr. Cesspool's plans. He has only been seen a couple times.
