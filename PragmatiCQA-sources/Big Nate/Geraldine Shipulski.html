   Mrs. Shipulski is constantly interviewed by Nate for the

   Shipulski loves going on Twitter and has 22 million followers, placing her on a par with Snoop Dogg, who wants to get to know her. Sometimes this distracts her from her work, making

   furious. She has more followers than Pit-Bull. The rapper.
