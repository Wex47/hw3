   Max is an apprentice troubadour learning how to be a troubadour from her Uncle Budrick. Max adds that she does not want to be a troubadour and that it is the middle ages. While passing through a field, Uncle Budrick spots a cabbage and says that they will make stew for lunch. Suddenly, the owner of the field begins to shoot arrows at them, but they escape. They end up in a forest and find apples to eat. While climbing a tree, Max sees a city. Uncle Budrick says that it is the city of Byjovia and that he was born there. He says that he left because that he was supposed to be a knight. A troubadour named Tom Foolery came to Byjovia and took on Uncle Budrick as an apprentice, and Uncle Budrick adds that he hasn't been to Byjovia since. A man walks up to them and asks for something as he is a traveller. They offer him some apples, but he pulls out a dagger and asks for everything else.

   They try to stop him by telling him that they are only troubadours and not knights, as the stranger thinks, but the stranger decides to kill Uncle Budrick anyway. Max luckily picks up Uncle Budrick's broken lute and a rock and uses the lute like an arrow to shoot a rock at the thief, who is knocked out cold. Max then tries to teach Uncle Budrick how to do so, but Uncle Budrick accidentally shoots their mule (A mule is like a donkey.) Dusty in the rear end. Dusty then runs off. They try to pull their cart, but they are unable to. They decide to bring a few things in a bag, and Max takes the thief's dagger. As they walk along, Max brings up the question of where they will sleep. Uncle Budrick says that someone will surely let them sleep in their house because they follow their king, Conrad The Kind. When Uncle Budrick was a kid, Conrad was loved by everyone except his brother, Gastley, because he realized that he would never be king since Conrad was older, unless Conrad were to die. Gastley then made up a plan to kill him; he pretended to be the king's good friend Gadabout and coated the tip of his sword with poison. During a celebration of Conrad's king era, there was a sword fight between Conrad and Gastley (Disguised as Gadabout.) Their primary purpose was to entertain the crowd. However, Gastley took a deadly swing at him, and his sword touches a tree. A spectator notices that the place where the blade touched was 'dying Gastley is then revealed when Conrad takes off his helmet. Conrad didn't kill Gastley however because he was too tender, so instead, he banished Gastley from the kingdom. By that point, the duo arrives at Byjovia. They walk around for a bit, seeing if they can find anyone that Uncle Budrick knows. However, they bump into a man who shouts, "Watch where you're going, fool!" and they fall in the way of a lady pushing a cart of pumpkins, who screams, "Hey, get out of the way!" Max is surprised and expresses that he thought that Byjovians were friendly, and Uncle Budrick says that maybe something has changed and Conrad isn't king anymore. They turn a corner and see a statue that says "IN MEMORY OF OUR KING CONRAD/ 1328-1385" (Remember, it's the middle ages.)

   Uncle Budrick is surprised and says that Conrad couldn't have died because he was so young, but he struggles to find how old he was. That's when they meet Kevyn, who says that Conrad was 57 when he died and mentions that 57 isn't 'young,' as Uncle Budrick says. Most people die when they are about the same age as Uncle Budrick, who says weakly, "What a cheery thought." As they introduce each other, Uncle Budrick mentions that they were robbed and are broke. However, Kevyn tells them not to talk so loudly and leads them to a house. As they walk, Max notices that everyone is giving them the stink eye. Once they are inside, Kevyn says that if a Royal Guard overheard Uncle Budrick saying that they were broke, they might have been thrown in the dungeon for 'vagrancy'. Uncle Budrick is outraged and says that this would not have happened when he was a boy. Kevyn then says that Gastley (Conrad's brother who tried to kill him) has become king. He then gives Uncle Budrick and Max a scroll with the following words on it:

   Max is impressed by the poem. But just then, they can hear marching noises outside. The noise is coming from the Royal Guards. (Kevyn explains that wherever the King is, they are.) Just then, King Gastley steps out of a coach and everyone cheers. Uncle Budrick is surprised and asks why everyone is cheering. Kevyn replies that they must cheer, or else they'd be thrown in prison, but he says it's worse than that, and most Byjovians

   Gastley, and his cruelness has rubbed off on them. Uncle Budrick is about to mention the evil eyes the people were giving them when they first walked towards Kevyn's house when Max notices that Gastley is walking towards an alley. He finds two homeless kids (a boy and a girl) and asks where their shoes are. The girl says that they left them at home, and King Gastley asks where their home is. The girl stammers, but the boy bravely says that they have no home. Gastley calls them a bunch of vagrants and tells the guards to take them to his dungeon, but Max runs out of his hiding place and tells them to stop. Gastley admires that he is wearing shoes and a hat and tells him to 'Take off your hat, boy.' Max tells him not to call her a boy, then takes off her hat, revealing herself to be a girl.

   However, King Gastley is unmoved and tells his guards to take Max along to the dungeon, but a guard says they ran away. The guard is then ordered to go after them. Gastley grabs Max by the arm, taking her to the dungeon himself. Budrick runs towards him, asking for mercy. He explains that Max is with him. Gastley asks who Budrick is, and he replies with, "Merely an entertainer, Your Eminentness." Gastley says he needs an entertainer, making Budrick into his fool. Budrick thinks he can't, but Gastley threatens him and says it is an honor to be the fool. Budrick panics saying that it IS an honor. He is taken into the coach, and Max tries to go after him, but Kevyn holds her back. Max assumes that Kevyn thought she was a boy, which Kevyn admits is true, embarrassed. Max forgives him entirely, telling him that that is what everyone thinks at first. Kevyn says he was more surprised by Max's bravery to stand up to King Gastley. Max then calls Gastley a jerk, and Kevyn tells her to 'SHHHHHH!' because Gastley's spies are everywhere. Max then tells him that she can't just stand around while her uncle is in trouble. Still, Kevyn says that he isn't necessarily in trouble because the fool is supposed to keep the king entertained, and if Uncle Budrick is a good entertainer, they have nothing to fear about. Although she loves Uncle Budrick, Max then thinks that she wouldn't put him in the 'Troubadour Hall Of Fame. Kevyn then takes her to the stable, which is also his home. His father, Nolan, works there as an ostler. (A person who takes care of horses.) They walk in, and Kevyn introduces Max. Max tells Kevyn's father what happened to Uncle Budrick, and they begin to plan on how to save him when the two street kids from earlier run in. They say that Gastley's guards are chasing them, and Nolan helps them into the loft. Max goes to hide, too, because the guards might recognize her. The guards knock on the door of the stable and explain their purpose. Nolan welcomes them in, 'but if they are willing to risk it.' When the guards ask why, Nolan explains that one of his horses has fetlock fever and that if they come in, they might be infected. However, he says, not everyone dies from it. 'With any luck, they'd only get oozing pimples all over their', but he is unable to finish his sentence. That is because the soldiers have run away. Max is impressed, but Kevyn is worried because he thinks

   might get fetlock fever. Nolan says that they are safe because there is no such thing as fetlock fever. The street kids then introduce themselves as Millicent(Millie for short.) and Simon. They all begin to brainstorm ideas on how to save Uncle Budrick. Millie asks if it won't be dangerous to invade the castle, and Max says that although it is, they have to try. She suggests that they storm the castle, but Nolan says that the castle is too heavily guarded. Kevyn sighs and says, "Perhaps we're up a creek without a paddle, to coin a phrase.", While Nolan reflects on the word 'coin,' Simon adds that you'd need to be a wizard to get into the castle. Nolan then walks over to a nearby drawer, repeating the words 'wizard' and 'coin' repeatedly. He finally finds what he is looking for, a coin, and says that Mumblin, the royal sorcerer, gave to him many years ago when he nursed his favourite mare back to health as a token of gratitude. When Mumblin gave Nolan the coin, he said, " If you ever need help, hold the coin tight. I'll be there in the blink of an eye!" However, when Nolan holds it, Mumblin doesn't appear. Max then realizes that Nolan is only doing half of what Mumblin said. He said, "I'll be there in the blink of an eye!" Which meant he had to blink. When Nolan does so, the coin grows hot, and he is unable to hold it.

   Suddenly, Mumblin appears in a tub, taking a bath. Mumblin then says it happens every time. He takes a bath, and someone interrupts him with another coin. Nolan is disappointed to learn his coin isn't one-of-a-kind. Mumblin then tries to conjure himself some dry clothing but ends up with a rabbit suit. He then says he's a bit rusty before summoning his proper attire. He then tells the group he is retired, but Max tells him about her problem. When she pulls out her dagger, Mumblin is surprised to see it. And when he asks, "Where did you get this, boy?" and Max says that she's a girl, that surprises him even more. He asks for her name, and when she tells him, he seems happy about it. The rest of the group introduces themselves, and Mumblin agrees to help them. They go to Nolan's house, and while they're headed over there, Max asks Nolan why he changed his mind about helping them, and Mumblin responds that he'll answer the question 'when the time is right'.
