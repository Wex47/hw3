   The family room is at the front of the house near the front floor. The stairs to the second floor are also located in the family room. The room includes a sofa bed, where Martin offered
   Chad Applewhite
   to sleep there during his stay. There is also a lounge chair next to a lamp. There is a TV in the family room. It used to be a large 90s style TV with a small screen that was on the floor, but was eventually replaced by a flat screen TV on a table. There was once an Atari connected to the TV, but was likely stored or thrown out. It was replaced by a Xbox 360 or One, as Nate mentioned that Uncle Ted played Halo, a FPS game, on the couch.

    The smoke alarm in the kitchen frequently goes off due to Martin's dismal cooking skills, as he usually burns the food.

    Once, the roof above the family room was destroyed when Martin accidentally catapulted a snowman's head too high, smashing through the roof.

    It is usually egged on Halloween and was once spray-painted, as Marty usually hands out disliked candy on Halloween, such as zesty ranch soy nuts, rice cakes or trail mix (not the good kind with M&amp;Ms and peanuts).

    Ellen's bedroom was once painted, resulting in her having to stay in Nate's bedroom for a few days. During this time, Ellen put posters all around Nate's walls, organized the messy room, built a troll village and even sprayed perfume all around the room (which resulted in Francis thinking that Nate put on perfume during baseball practice).

    The house does not have air-conditioning or any ceiling fans, which Nate often complains about during the summer.
