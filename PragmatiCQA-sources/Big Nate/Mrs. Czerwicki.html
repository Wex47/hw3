   Mrs. Czerwicki has a white, curly,
   frizzy wig

  <p key="30c387f9-d5f6-49d9-a489-f9fe641d1f6b">
   Czerwicki is devoted and easily interested, something she hides under a sarcastic, laid back persona. Still, she is surprisingly lenient for one in her position, allowing Nate to speak up and giving him honest answers, and even considering tolerating his ventures to the art studio.
  </p>
  <p key="478fe951-ec3b-4d99-80e7-56529a60537a">
   She is fond of reading romance novels during detention to pass the time, possibly because her romance with Mr. Czerwicki is a huge strain. Nate sometimes uses this to escape detention. He waits for her to get into a very engaging chapter, then asks to leave. One of the romantic novels she reads is
   Flames of Longing
   .

   She was born in 1938 and bilived to have lived a very diciplined childhood. It is unknown how Czerwicki became a detention monitor, but she did say that she volunteers for it. Her husband took her to a hockey game for their anniversary (which he does serveral idiotic stuff like this for anniversaries and Valentine's Day), making her angry. They had two children, though Czerwicki seemed estranged from them. Eventually, her son was imprisoned for reasons unknown.
  </p>
  <p key="9168b48f-a906-4aea-9caf-0db7b69e7dd0">
   She was once an actress with a promising career until she got married.
  </p>
  <p key="c85c1726-38e4-4087-9db9-cad51a4b37b4">
   Shortly after her wig caught on fire, she told Nate he had broken the record of the most detention slips. This made him very excited, as he had been attempting to surpass everyone else throughout the day.
  </p>
  <p key="cc41d2b3-d090-42de-a637-716f4feac74b">
   At some point before P.S. 38's passage to

   , she told Nate that he received three detentions that week. She also gave Nate the idea for the P.S. 38 Cartooning Club.
  </p>
  <p key="edd5c697-42f2-477f-afa2-b2c45f7f5249">
   On two occasions, she is shocked that Nate got ten detentions, which is a new record.
