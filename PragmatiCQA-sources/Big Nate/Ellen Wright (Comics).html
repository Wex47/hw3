   Every few months, she decides that she doesn't like her laugh, so she tries to change it, as seen in

   Ellen can be known as self-absorbed, and obnoxious, though only Nate seems to think she is obnoxious. She is surprisingly mature and obedient for her age, although she is annoying to Nate. This, however, is not always the case. In the later years of the strip, the two seemingly get along fine with each other and are hardly seen arguing with each other. She is also a good student, admired by several teachers at P.S. 38. Apparently she really enjoys karaoke. Still, she dislikes anyone outside her comfort zone. She is very attractive as a few different guys throughout the comics have had a crush on her. She is also confident in her body and likes to wear appealing clothes.

   Ellen has a variety of perfumes (Nate and Francis once snuck into her room in the 01/14/1992 storyline!). They make her smell "like a gift shop filled with scented candles", according to Nate. One example of perfume she uses is "Dead Skunk", though Nate was probably making up the name because the perfume apparently really stunk. He says that all her hair-care products are single-handedly destroying the ozone layer.
