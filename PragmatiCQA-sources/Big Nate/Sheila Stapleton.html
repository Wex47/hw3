   is Francis' girlfriend. Their relationship seemed to last throughout most of the school year, though it is possible they met in elementary school. Their relationship is such that Francis calls Sheila "Pookie", and Sheila calls Francis "cubby." Sheila is also willing to respect Francis' friends, namely Nate Wright, even though Nate thinks their relationship is annoying to him. According to him, Francis is not himself around Sheila (likely correct). Sheila believes that Francis is more sensitive and sweet than the other boys, claiming to be more like a girl than a boy. Francis proceeds to say that her statement hit a little close to home as he just isn't very "macho" (though Sheila wasn't surprised by this statement), and Francis claims to hide it very well. Sheila is not seen much in the comic strip anymore, and may have split up with Francis at some point.

   Sheila respects Francis' best friend, Nate Wright, as a person and a friend, despite Nate thinking negatively of her relationship with Francis. Sheila often criticizes Nate for his behavior. At one point, they competed to become the school treasurer. Nate Wright seems to try to use Francis and Sheila to match up Jenny with Nate, but it has never worked. Nate once wanted Sheila to do a cheer for a chess meet.
