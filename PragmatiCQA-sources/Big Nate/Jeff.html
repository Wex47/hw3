   When Nate lost his lucky socks, Jeff returned them, but to Nate's shock, he washed them, which Nate thought washed the luck off because it refreshed them. Nate once told him to give a note to

   Jeff appears not to be very bright or smart, as he thought he needed to be hazed to join a posse and he sent a message to Andy instead of Angie. He is also unattractive, according to Nate.
