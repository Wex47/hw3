   doesn't like their taste, because he considers them underwhelming. He ate them and had a very sick look on his face.

    In real life, Cheezy Weezies are hot, salty shop chips sit on paper. A handful of grated cheese goes on top. These chips are then drizzled with mayonnaise, perhaps tomato sauce, and the paper is wrapped up into a hot steaming parcel.
