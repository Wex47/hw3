He met Nate through a chess summer camp. He always looked up to

   and was considered as Nate's "chess groupie." He even once asked Nate for his autograph, even after practicing for 2 years and claiming that he was "Nate's equal" (even though he lost against Nate in 2 strips). Derek, like all others at the summer chess camp, was addicted to chess, and somehow turned every activity chess-related, much to Nate's frustration.
