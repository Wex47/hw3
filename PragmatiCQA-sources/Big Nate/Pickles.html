   She was born on May 3, known because on
   she had a birthday party. There were 5 candles on the cake, indicating she was 5 years old at the time, meaning she was born on May 3, 2004. That doesn't make sense however, as she was shown in strips before that.
It is unknown when Francis bought Pickles, but she quickly developed a habit of marking her territory. She also fell in love with

   got a black eye trying to stop Spitsy from reaching Pickles while they were on a walk together. 
She is a very intelligent cat, once demonstrating just that by her EMT training. She can mountain bike and juggle on a unicycle while whistling. She can also play chess. Once Francis brought her to his basketball game so she could be their mascot, even giving her a miniature jersey and tiny pom-poms, which Nate didn't like, leading to him deliberately throwing a basketball at her in the comic strips.
In one strip Francis said that she was going to go mountain biking.
