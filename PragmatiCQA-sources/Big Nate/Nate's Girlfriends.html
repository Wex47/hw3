   (AKA “The Brain”), and fell in love with her while playing a game of chess against her. Nate had lost the match to Vanessa De Vries because he had a crush on her and couldn’t focus. and after that, she appeared in 2001's biggest chess tournament yet arc (January 1–13) and this time, Nate beat her at chess since she bet with Nate that she would go out with him if he won. This was cancelled since the tournament had a no betting rule, and Vanessa hasn't appeared since then. It was right after he broke up with Kelly.
