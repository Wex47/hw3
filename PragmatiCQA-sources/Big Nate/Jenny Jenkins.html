   has had a crush on her ever since first grade. She used to find Nate to be extremely annoying and bothering and despised him but now usually tolerates him.  Nate had a problem with Artur's relationship, but he has gotten over his crush on her. Nate also thinks Jenny likes him deep down, but this is not proven in any books. Jenny became friends with Nate eventually because he had gotten over her. Over time though, she says things that hint that she doesn't really want to be friends with him nor like him. Later on, she leaves

   and moves away to Seattle, but not forever. Then, in the middle of a baseball game, Nate sees that Jenny has returned. However, from there, though, she has only been a minor character and has not been shown that often in recent books.
She was born on September 22, 1979, making her a Virgo. Once, Nate told her that his sign, Scorpio, is compatible with Virgos. She said that was great because Artur is also a Scorpio, which disappointed Nate.

   When Jenny was two years old, she kissed Nate on the cheek as a "joke". Jenny also did that in preschool.
In preschool, Jenny would chase all of the boys around the school, and when she caught them, she kissed them on the cheek.
In 2004, Jenny Jenkins met

   , beginning a long and fateful relationship in 2008. In first grade, Nate began a crush on Jenny. Although she used to be very mean to him, she eventually became more civil towards him, while Nate did the same and stopped chasing after her constantly.
Jenny also took part in the school dance and, the following week, the

   in something after seven years.
Jenny moved to Seattle, Washington, and Artur and Jenny break up because they know they will not see each other again. She later came back, causing a fly ball (in baseball terms) to hit Nate in the head when he was off-guard. Jenny also asked Nate out to the spring formal because there wasn't anyone else to ask.
Nate isn't as pushy to Jenny anymore.

   Jenny was the love interest of Nate, who wished that she would dump Artur one day and start dating him instead. However, Nate is over Jenny. She has had a very long relationship with Artur, and they currently still go out.
She has also shown to be polite and hard-working. She usually freaks out whenever something bad happens to her (i.e. Nate accidentally trips and splashes egg salad on Jenny's hair, causing her to go insane). She is also short-tempered and very hot-headed, probably because a Virgo likes things exacting. She used to beat up Nate whenever he tries to make his move on her. Because Nate always tried to follow her around, she was constantly trying to avoid or ignore him. She is noticeably nicer to Nate now and finally considers him as a friend.

    Back in the 1990s, she used to be much more aggressive and unfair to Nate than now. An example of this is that she seldom showed compassion for him. In the 2000s, she was a bit nicer, but she is still furious, although she would always be talking to Nate in the hallways about her troubles in both eras. She still has some kindness, and now in the 2000s, she does not mind him much, and an example was in June 2013, when she was much more mellow. In March 2014, when they had a fact town smackdown, she will never mind when he interrupted. On February 1 and 2 of 2013, she was very nice to Nate. Her relationship with Nate is still not high, but now she likes him as a friend. At a later time, she would be more friendly. She is a close friend to Nate and does not have a crush on her anymore, however still trying to prove that Jenny and Artur are not a good couple.

During the spring formal, Nate left Jenny to sit down for two hours to get Angie (his former girlfriend) and her boyfriend, Dan Labrecque back together. They ended up dancing for only 5 minutes.
