   I search the grocery store in haste, To find that sweet lip-smacking taste. And there it is, in aisle nine. It's just a dollar thirty-nine. A bag of doodles most delicious, Check the label: They're nutritious! And do you know how satisfied, I feel while munching doodles fried? I savor each bright orange curl, Until it seems I just might hurl. Their praises I will always sing. Cheez Doodles are my everything.|

   he "mumbled quite a bit" and he also had orange teeth because allegedly his mouth was filled with Cheez Doodles when he recited the poem. Before the final draft of the poem, Nate had wrote a rough draft on
   but had got rid of it because he couldn't find a word that rhymed with "orange".
