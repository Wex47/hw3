   , are involved in the "book buddy" program where sixth graders read books with their first-grade buddies. When Nate became a sixth-grader, Nate showed up for the book buddy program, causing Mrs. Bigbee to feel terrified to have to interact with him again. She has been teaching for at least six years.

    . He was very memorable when he was in Mrs. Bigbee's first grade class, and she was not happy when finding out that he was now a book buddy. When Nate was in first grade, he made a nickname for Mrs. Bigbee, Mrs. Bigbutt.

    - Peter is a first grader in Mrs. Bigbee's class. He is Nate's book buddy and writting buddy, but dreads book buddy and writting buddy time since he is a better reader than Nate. He has made appearances outside of Mrs. Bigbee's class as well.

    - Another first grader, Miranda is very violent and aggressive. Once, Nate had to substitute as her book buddy, and she threatened to "deck" him. Nate is scared of her. She has made appearances outside of Mrs. Bigbee's class as well. She watches boxing shows and that is what probably made her so aggressive.

    - Mrs. Bigbee taught Francis at the same time as Nate. Though nowadays, they never interact. We are assuming, from Francis' track record, that she liked him a lot.
