   Little is known about his early life, however, it is possible he was born before the 1970's, as he is around Martin Wright's age. It is known he went to some sort of school, and possibly college or university.

   Mr. Chung went for a job as a teacher, and eventually took the Jefferson Middle School job. He was employed sometime before 2008, as he was introduced as a teacher in 2008. He taught Jefferson Middle School Social Studies for a while, until he was given the job to teach P.S 38 students after the health problems with mold in their school. Sometime in September, Mr. Chung was informed that he would be teaching Social Studies, alongside Clara Godfrey, who would also be teaching Social Studies, in a different class. Some known P.S 38 students who were taught by him, include
