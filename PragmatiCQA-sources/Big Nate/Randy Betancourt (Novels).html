These are probably what shaped his ego the wrong way, as has been proved in many psychological studies. In the end, Randy joins the 38th Annual Mud Bowl and beat Jefferson Middle School. After this Randy stated that he could live without Ruby in his life.

   In this book, Randy is one of the main characters. Randy is the captain of his fleeceball team, the Raptors. Nate leads Randy and his posse to his locker. Then proceeds to open his locker and get Randy buried under trash. Later, Randy grabbed Chad's notebook and ran into Nate's table and got a bloody nose. He lied that Nate gave him a bloody nose to Ms. Clarke, but she knew the truth and sent him to the nurse. In the fleeceball game between Nate's team and Randy's team, in the ninth inning, Randy grounded out to first base and stomped on Nate's foot. Gina replaced Nate and committed an error, allowing two runs. Gina hit a walk-off home run, defeating the Raptors.

   When Nate and Dee Dee arrive at the Beach Party Dance, Randy teases them by yelling out that Nate and Dee Dee are the "hot new couple". Dee Dee retaliated by saying that Nate is just her friend, but that he would not know because he has no friends. Nate was surprised that Dee Dee stood up to Randy, as not many people have. When Nate is in the middle of changing his clothes for the dance, Randy steals them.

   Later, Nate finds the perfect way to get revenge on Randy by writing a new newspaper column, with Guess That Guy. The mystery student was claimed to have low intelligence, a huge nose, bad breath, enjoyed picking on smaller kids, and was a total weasel, but what ultimately gave it away was when the column said that the mystery student's name rhymed with "Shmandy Shmetancourt". Upon seeing the newspaper column, an irate Randy tracked Nate down and confronted him. They had a BIG fight in the halls, and they had to have peer counseling with Gina. On a science trip to somewhere, Randy and Nate HAD to partner up. Suddenly, Nolan appeared, making fun of Nate as usual, then Randy came and stood up to Nolan.
