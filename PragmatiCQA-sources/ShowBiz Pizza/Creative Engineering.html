The corporate-made showtapes used Showbiz employees impersonating the Creative voices, often poorly. This production of showtapes lasted until the New Year's show of 1987.

   On September 26, 2013, there was an explosion at the Creative Engineering headquarters and warehouse at 47 Jefferson St. in Orlando, Florida. A whole back wall collapsed, doors were damaged, ceilings fell, part of the floor was broken, shelves and equipment were knocked over and the basement was flooded. The explosion was caused by a highly flammable experimental fuel Aaron Fechter was working on called "Hydrillium". Since then, Aaron was able to fix most of the major damage and put up a new wall. The blown open Hydrillium tank is a popular sight during the tour of the building.
