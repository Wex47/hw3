   The 2-Stage was introduced in March 1992 with the first installation in White Settlement, Texas. Some 2-Stages were created from
   Balcony
   and
   C-Stages
   , mainly involving putting the animatronics on new leg assemblies, installing new arm assemblies on Munch and Pasqually, and redressing the animatronics to resemble their

   ; the only real difference being that, rather than all five band members sharing one stage,
   Chuck E.
   is off to the right side on his own stage, with his own curtains and lighting. On the main stage, where Chuck E. usually stands, there is a large-screen rear projection TV that plays the current
   showtape
   ; above the TV is a color-changing Fiber Optic display that reads "Chuck E. Cheese." The remaining characters
   Helen Henny
   ,
   Munch
   ,
   Jasper
   , and
   Pasqually
   , are on stage left.
   The Wink
   is above both stages.

   Throughout the 1990s up to the 2010s, some 2-Stages have been converted to 1-Stages with their original props remaining. These conversions are unofficially known as
   1/2 Stages

    Although the 1-Stage, 2-Stage, and
    Road Stage
    are all very similar, there are often some additional differences with the band itself. For instance, sometimes Munch sports a personalized hat, sometimes no hat at all.

The "ribbons" on the sides of Chuck E.'s head, read, at one time, "In Pizza We Trust", a slogan that also appeared on tokens, cups, and the sort. Most were painted over with red, white and blue paint.
