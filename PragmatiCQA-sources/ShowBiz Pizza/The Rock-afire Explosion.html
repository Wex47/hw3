   restaurants from 1980 to 1993. The show was pioneering in many respects to other animatronic shows of the early 1980s, featuring life-sized characters capable of facial expression; some were even programmed in such a way that they could actually play simple melodies on musical instruments. The show was created and manufactured by

   In 2008, the creator and technical engineer of the band, Aaron Fechter reintroduced the ensemble as a cover band for a variety of pop, rock, and hip-hop groups, including acts ranging from the mid 20th century to the present. Reprogramming the Rock-afire characters to cover new songs, Fechter reached new and younger audiences and also re-connected with the older audience.

  </h2>
  <p key="1fc1cc81-37bc-4fcc-9163-874bc6920c11">
   Production of the programming and audio for the show was done in-house by Creative Engineering, Inc. in Orlando, Florida. All Rock-afire shows were produced completely in-house, with Creative Engineering employees not only manufacturing the characters, but also writing and performing their songs and skits.
  </p>
  <p key="58209026-e854-4e4d-a9e0-c9d88f326366">
   Unlike other animatronic shows of the early 1980s, the Rock-afire Explosion was designed to be life-sized, with most of the performers being about the size of an average adult human. Additionally, Fechter implemented the use of latex masks for the characters' faces, as opposed to the fabric masks common in animatronics of the time. The latex masks were designed to fit over various movable parts on the characters' faces, permitting them a range of facial expressions, including smiling and the raising of eyebrows. Fechter also implemented computer programming that permitted some of the characters to move in rhythm with music, making it theoretically possible for them to play actual instruments.

   , another restaurant chain that was popular in other parts of the United States. In the mid-1980s, both venues began to suffer financial difficulties, partially due to the video game crash of 1983 and also due to Showbiz Pizza's having opened more restaurants than they could afford to maintain. When "Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre" filed for bankruptcy in 1984, Showbiz Pizza bought the company, hoping that new talent and merchandising opportunities could save both companies.
  </p>
  <p key="3aa699b7-55e6-4dd0-83e4-098a9c6d7176">
   By 1985, Richard M. Frank joined the company as CEO and chairman. The corporation maintained the two restaurant chains simultaneously for several years. Each continued its own stage shows and sold different merchandise. However, in the latter part of the decade, difficulties between Creative Engineering and Showbiz began to arise. Aaron Fechter, the founder of Creative Engineering and creator of the Rock-afire Explosion, claimed that the fallout between his company and Showbiz arose when Showbiz asked him to sign away the licensing and copyrights to the Rock-afire Explosion, which would have allowed Showbiz to cut production costs on the show, such as manufacture of future shows and royalty payments to Creative Engineering. Fechter refused, on the grounds that Showbiz offered no monetary compensation for the rights.
  </p>
  <p key="e3cfaec1-b887-4644-8928-2e6e3b798ded">
   The creative control held by Fechter became stifled, as the company produced their own tapes for the Rock-afire, using voice impersonators to play the characters. Showbiz also learned how to program the characters, thus taking even more creative control away from Fechter.
  </p>
  <p key="1cb4849a-8b52-41a2-92d6-af2800baeaba">
   In 1986, Creative Engineering made one final attempt at regaining control over show production by programming and recording their version of the Liberty Showtape, which was produced to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the

   </a>
   . However, all of Creative Engineering's programming was erased in a "late night celebration". In addition, Creative Engineering created and sent out an unauthorized, ten-minute, unscripted Christmas showtape to all Showbiz locations, in which the characters sit around discussing the spirit of Christmas, thanking the store managers, and stating their intent to stay together. These Rock-afire shows led to Creative Engineering regaining the recording rights, but Showbiz never gave back control on programming, resulting in some embarrassing programming errors (such as characters singing with the wrong voices).
  </p>
  <p key="1846bd3d-2a5d-4b42-bb3c-62c1714a1ea7">
   Ultimately, the company decided to enact a process called "Concept Unification", in which all Showbiz Pizza locations would be remodeled into Chuck E. Cheese's. The remodel included the elimination of all Rock-afire characters from merchandise and advertising and retrofitting/reprogramming the Rock-afire Explosion animatronics into a new show called

  </p>
  <p key="f5161478-14b0-422a-bca3-d3524bb23224">
   "Concept Unification" was tested between 1989 and 1990 and occurred sporadically at Showbiz locations for the next two years, with the final Showbiz being converted in 1993. As Concept Unification began at each location, the left and center stages of the Rock-afire show were shut down, leaving only the Rolfe and Earl characters operational. During this period, the characters performed "

   ", featuring the voices of Showbiz employees imitating the characters. The two ran a highlights reel of old Rock-afire shows and wondered out loud what the band would do now, and hinted at the coming Chuck E. Cheese-themed show. "The Rolfe and Earl Show" was the final Rock-afire show produced for ShowBiz. After Concept Unification had been completed on the center and left stages, Rolfe and Earl were removed. Rolfe's animatronic was converted into

   Although Fechter attempted to keep Creative Engineering afloat following the termination of his Showbiz contract, he was ultimately forced to terminate all of his employees, a process he dragged out over the course of several years as he struggled to find new venues for the show. Animatronics were being viewed as a dated art form by that time, and

Fechter sells both new and used animatronic equipment in addition to giving tours of the warehouse.

By the late 2000s (among other abnormalities), the multiple "show selector" buttons were replaced with a single round button, and the characters did not move at all (although music did play and lights did flash). Eventually, the show was put out of commission and when the original "Fun Zone" closed in 2011, the entire show was taken out of the building and auctioned off.
