   is an FEC restaurant and arcade operating in Barboursville, West Virginia that has

   </a>
   . Their Rock-afire Explosion is very well known by many people to be in very poor condition, with each Rock-afire character having mechanical faults and cosmetic deterioration. It is currently one of the last public places to see a Rock-afire Explosion perform after many other family entertainment centers either closed or trashed their shows over the years between the mid 2000's to around the mid 2010's.

   The Billy Bob's Wonderland franchise dates back to 1989 with its first location in East Barboursville. It was a former Showbiz Pizza Place location that was rebranded and redecorated to avoid any corporate interference with
   Showbiz Pizza Time Inc.
   and the upcoming

   conversion. There was a second location that opened in Ashland, KY, but no opening date has been confirmed. The current location (which both the East Barboursville and Ashland stores relocated to) opened in 2003 and was a lot bigger in size than the two previous locations. Both shows from the old locations were brought to the current store, but only one was put on stage. That would be the show from Ashland, KY.

   The restaurant also had an outdoor amusement area with mini-golf and go-karts similar to that of a Celebration Station (an FEC which also had mini-golf, go-karts, and other outdoor activities as well as previously having animatronic shows). This section was called "Billy Bob's Adventure Golf &amp; Go-Karts". It was permanently closed in 2016 and hasn't reopened since then.

   From 2014-2015, the show was (somewhat) restored by David Ferguson of DSF Robots and Goofy Gas Fillin' Station fame. Most of the broken movements were repaired, the controller was replaced with David's signature BlueBox, and the cosmetics were also replaced. Though the show got fixed, most of the parts were aftermarket and did not last very long (this was mainly caused by the air pressure being too high that caused the animatronics' masks to melt and some movements to break).

   As of January 2019, the show was in very poor condition. The characters’ masks were melting,

   wore a walkaround head, and

   didn’t work. The show underwent a mechanical and cosmetical restoration by Brayon Giles and Anthony Ybarra until they were fired in late 2019. Since their firing, the condition quality of the RAE in the store was (and has since been) going downhill.

   Billy Bob’s Wonderland also has two spare Rock-afire shows in a trailer behind the restaurant. These are used for spare parts.

   In late September 2021, Braylon returned to Billy Bob's as a technician. He is currently restoring the whole Rock-afire Explosion show.

   The restoration is said to be done by early December 2021.
