   Pizzacam is a blue anthropomorphized television camera with a lens for the nose, and a mouth with two buck teeth. Pizzacam rises from a speaker box, which replaces Looney Bird's oil barrel. Unlike Looney Bird, Pizzacam doesn't normally have a voice or dialogue in shows. However, in a handful of shows, his animatronic moved to the announcer's voice. He occasionally sings backup, similar to the
   Moon
   and the

   and also bounces up and down to the music.
  </p>
  <p key="f4375d77-05f3-4e19-ac2a-b26602499734">
   Since the mid to late 2000s, the Pizzacam animatronics have been removed from most 3-Stage locations due to poor conditions. The locations that removed him, also, removed his speakerbox, boarded up his trapdoor, and carpeted it over. Some locations also moved Pasqually to the center of the stage afterward.
  </p>
  <p key="b0e84e28-7448-4672-8bd6-78f2c420b96a">
   There are currently four  known locations that still have Pizzacam
   . They are located in:
  </p>
  <ul key="f87e7f82-c8be-4825-8b15-4318e66ca844">

   </li>
  </ul>
  <p key="10adf15a-802d-435c-918f-7b43af954f2e">
   There are also four locations that still have Pizzacam's speaker box but not Pizzacam himself. They are located in:
  </p>
  <ul key="60b3dd03-2c55-43ea-810f-15e4ef074465">

   Some locations have customized their Pizzacam's appearance. For example, Huntsville, Alabama, and Madison, Tennessee have a new face made from black plastic instead of the original latex face. Roanoke, Virginia also received a black plastic face in early 2016. Huntsville also used to have a bandana on Pizzacam in 2013.
  </p>
  <p key="55f3753b-c26f-4d7b-975b-3138946a3197">
   Laurel, Maryland is currently the last location to still have a Pizzacam with a latex mask (without his teeth). However, Richmond, Virginia had a Pizzacam that was in poor condition. He was restored by a fan in August of 2017
   , who gave him a new mask and shell, but he was removed in December 2018 because the lift cylinder was broken and too expensive to repair. His box is currently still there.

   Outside of the stage show, Pizzacam has appeared as a puppet in the two "Charlie Rockit" intermissions from the You're a Star showtape from September 1993. Here, Pizzacam delivers letters (in his mouth, flying through the air) to Charlie﻿ about the Unidentified Flying Pizza (UFP) that lands at Chuck E. Cheese's.
