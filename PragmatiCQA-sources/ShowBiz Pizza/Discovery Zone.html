    Discovery Zone
   </b>
   was a chain of entertainment facilities featuring games and elaborate indoor mazes designed for young children, including slides, climbing play structures and ball pits. The chain was founded by Ronald Matsch, Jim Jorgensen and Dr. David Schoenstadt in 1989. The first location was opened in Lenexa, Kansas, in January 1990. An early investor and vocal supporter of the company was tennis player Billie Jean King.

   Stretched thin by expansion, changes in management tried to save the company. However, Discovery Zone filed for bankruptcy on March 26, 1996 in Wilmington, Delaware with debts of up to $366.8 million.
   By the end of 1999, Chuck E. Cheese's acquired approximately fifteen of DZ's locations for conversion into their concept while the rest were either closed down or converted to independent concepts.
