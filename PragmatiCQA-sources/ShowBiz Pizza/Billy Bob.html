   animatronic show (which had another bear named Billy Bob).
   Billy Bob's first appearance at ShowBiz Pizza Place was as a walk-around character at the first ShowBiz location at
   Antioch Shopping Center
   in Kansas City, Missouri. The character was named after two people; ShowBiz Pizza founder
   Bob Brock

   artist David "Billy Bob" Irvin. At the request of Stan Emerson, who worked for the advertising agency hired by ShowBiz, Billy Bob was given red and yellow overalls, the colors of ShowBiz Pizza.

  <p key="8e90c73f-2750-45ed-bb3e-8da50fa608f0">
   Billy Bob's first appearance as an animatronic character was with the launch of The Rock-afire Explosion. Billy Bob originally spoke with a heavy country accent, but this was later softened.
   Originally, as with Rolfe and Earl, Billy Bob and Looney Bird never interacted with the other stages, implying that they were originally intended to be a stand-alone side act.

   , was designed to resemble a gas station. It contained elements such as a backdrop with "Smitty's Super Service Station,", a gas pump, and an oil barrel.
   Some skits were written around the Smitty's theme, discussing Billy Bob's invention of gasohol (also called "Goofy Gas"), an alternative for gasoline that was also drinkable.

   ". In this new stage design, the Smitty's backdrop was removed, Looney Bird's oil barrel was repainted green, the trees from center stage were relocated to stage left behind Billy Bob, and a new lamppost with a sign reading "ShowBiz Pizza Campground", in the style of the later logo, was installed. This stage was exclusive to ShowBiz Rock-afire installations. Rock-afire shows at other restaurants retained the Smitty's backdrop.
