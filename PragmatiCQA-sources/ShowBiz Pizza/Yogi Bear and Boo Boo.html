   In 1987, ShowBiz wanted to phase out The Rock-afire Explosion in favor of licensed characters such as
   Superman
   ,
   Spiderman
   , or
   Garfield
   to appeal to a wider audience and ultimately settled on
   Hanna-Barbera
   characters Yogi Bear and Boo Boo.

   Billy Bob's stage was retrofitted as Jellystone Park, with pine trees, and a picnic basket.

    Billy Bob

   was removed from the stage,
   Looney Bird
   became Boo-Boo with his oil barrel being repainted green, and

    Rolfe
   </a>
   was moved to stage left and was retrofitted to become Yogi Bear with
   Earl
   being completely removed. Oddly enough, the Curtain Valance Artwork for Billy Bob and Looney Bird was left in place.

   Voice-wise,
   Daws Butler
   and
   Don Messick
   reprised their respective roles.

   The new stage design was only tested at three restaurants located in Omaha, Nebraska; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Augusta, Georgia. It was discontinued after the one-year test period.

   For years, only the showtape instrumental tracks were available. However, in August 2020, the full showtape (minus a few seconds from “Every Breath You Take”) was found and uploaded by ShowBizPizza.com courtesy of co-producer Steve White.
