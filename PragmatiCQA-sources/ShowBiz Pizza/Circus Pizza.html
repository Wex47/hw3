   Circus Pizza was a restaurant with numerous locations in Minnesota. Locations consisted of Blaine MN, Brooklyn Park MN, Burnsville, MN, Edina MN, New Hope, MN, and West St. Paul MN. Every Circus Pizza location featured The Rock-afire Explosion alongside a clown mascot designated, Bumper The Clown. The Edina Circus Pizza location featured The New Rock-afire Explosion. The West St. Paul location was converted to a Chuck E. Cheese after Circus pizza was acquired by CEC Entertainment August 1999
