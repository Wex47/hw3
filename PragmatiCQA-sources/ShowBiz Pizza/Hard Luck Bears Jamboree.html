   The characters' voices also sound very different than their Rock-Afire counterparts. Billy Bob is voiced by entertainer Roger Dunn, who also voices the park's mascot, Gully Mouse.

  <p key="1aab512f-c1fe-4407-aa2c-5b09d4e1bf0d">
   There are 4 Gulliver’s theme parks but only 3 feature the show, the shows all have small differences between each park.

  <p key="b77d059d-2f92-4868-90b1-610b58bca070">
   Gulliver’s Kingdom in Matlock, Derbyshire has a setup similar to Disney’s Country Bear Jamboree show, with Looney Bird and Choo-Choo in front of the center stage, raising from the floor, instead of next to Billy Bob, and also features a carousel behind Rolfe and Earl.
  </p>
  <p key="fb19e410-adb2-487d-8d86-3d229b341144">
   Gulliver’s Land in Milton Keynes has Choo-Choo in front of Beach Bear instead of next to Dook’s drums, and no rain curtain on Rolfe’s stage.
  </p>
  <p key="595ea2f2-48d1-4127-a6cf-6487c99d62f4">

  </p>
  <p key="7ad31c73-a84d-414b-8498-51b9d5578274">
   Gulliver’s also have a Billy Bob walkaround currently located at the Matlock park, as well as “Billy Bob’s Bi-Planes” - a children’s airplane ride themed around Billy Bob and the gang.
  </p>
  <p key="61dd6c66-8a67-4803-8d26-1d698d201739">
   As of 2017, none of the three shows are running, and the signs have been removed.
  </p>
  <p key="e18fa9d7-fd76-426d-824f-9058b34cff9d">
   The theatre at Gulliver's World in Warrington is now being used for a magic show with the show abandoned behind black curtains, whilst the theatre at Matlock is being used as an employee changing room. The theatre at Milton Keynes is being used for storage.
