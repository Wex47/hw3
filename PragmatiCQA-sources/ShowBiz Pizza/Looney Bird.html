   , his predecessor being named "Gooney Bird". This version was nearly identical to the current Looney Bird in voice, appearance (aside from a longer beak, actual plumage, and a traditional barrel), and personality. A running gag in the show was that, every time he spoke, Mama Granbags would silence him by whacking him. Many shows gave reference to Looney siphoning away Billy Bob's "Gasahol" (sometimes referred to as "Goofy Gas"), meant to solve the woes of the
   second energy crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s

   Looney Bird's animatronic was designed to accentuate his crazy personality. His eyes were often programmed to roll around in random directions with eyelids closing opposite of each other. Additionally, he was outfitted with a large spring that caused him to rock around when lifting out of his barrel.

   By 1983, Looney Bird was retrofitted to have a set of hands that would pop up holding a piece of paper. These were used for what became an ongoing skit entitled "Letters to Looney Bird", in which he answered questions that people sent in. These letters were themed to go along with the current showtape.

   By the mid-1980s, Looney Bird's character went through a change. He became known for his technical abilities, even having a barrel full of gadgets. This new personality was most likely based on Aaron Fechter's prospects at the time. In one show, Looney Bird tells of his lifelong dream, to create a computer language that kids could use. Coincidentally, this was a project Aaron was actually working to achieve at the time.
