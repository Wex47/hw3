   In 1977, while working at
   Atari
   , Nolan Bushnell purchased Pizza Time Theatre from
   Warner Communications
   .
  </p>
  <p key="53324f49-29a3-4fc7-93f3-029dd125b23d">
   It had been created by Bushnell, originally as a place where kids could eat pizza and play video games, which would therefore function as a distribution channel for Atari games.
  </p>
  <p key="ee252839-c198-4c9a-b011-3761219f2db2">
   In 1981, Bushnell turned over day-to-day food operations of Chuck E. Cheese’s to a newly hired restaurant executive and focused on Catalyst Technologies.
  </p>
  <p key="28a20041-1d66-4178-8fd5-f18bdd0edd23">
   During this time, Bushnell was using large loans on his Pizza Time Theatre stock to fund Catalyst.
  </p>
  <p key="1056107c-553f-4d12-97ca-08026756d159">
   By the end of 1983, Pizza Time Theatre was having serious financial problems. President and long-time friend Joe Keenan resigned that fall. Bushnell tried to step back in, blaming the money problems on overexpansion, too much tweaking of the formula, and saturation in local markets by the management team. He resigned in February 1984, when the Board of Directors rejected his proposed changes. Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the fall of 1984.
