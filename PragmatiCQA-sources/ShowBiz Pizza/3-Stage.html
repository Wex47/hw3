     , which replaced the Rock-afire characters with Chuck E. Cheese's characters as Munch's Make Believe Band (Munch's Party Time Band in the prototype versions). This was accomplished by replacing the cosmetics on the existing animatronics, changing the locations of animatronics on the stage, changing stage backdrops, and upgrading equipment. All of the former Rock-afire animatronics were reused, with the exception of

     According to Jul Kamen (designer of the CU Prototype), after the Concept Unification Prototype, it was decided that Dave Thomas of Diversified Design, a former employee of Creative Engineering, would take a crack at redesigning the show. Dave went on to "Mitzify" Helen, and placed Munch on the keyboard due to his similar character-design to Fatz. A few tweaks and changes later, Munch's Make Believe Band was born.

     The first Munch's Make Believe Band 3-Stages were installed at the Dallas “Montfort”, Texas location and in CEC Department 18 in November 1989. From there on out, a handful of other test stages were installed in 1990. They included several differences (most notably the building backdrops and Pasqually’s brick wall) compared to the finalized 3-Stage shows in 1991.

    <p key="51c4b66d-f07b-41e0-bd77-0603c8863902">
     During Concept Unification, the animatronics were fitted with latex masks, similar to the masks on Rock-afire Explosion characters prior to Concept Unification. Beginning in November 1999, in a cost-cutting measure, the latex masks on the animatronics would begin to be replaced with ones made of plastic at all locations

      The 3-Stage in Wilmington, North Carolina was the last known 3-Stage to have had both Munch Jr. and a white helicopter light. However, this particular 3-Stage also lacked the "Munch's Make Believe Band" sign and had a Helen with ginger hair instead of black and white. This location also had Pizzacam, but, strangely, with a fedora. Pasqually and Munch also had latex right shoes, and plastic left shoes. Munch also had his cap, and Chuck E. had his rockstar shirt and jeans, making this and Department 18 the only 3-Stages to have had them both. This location closed on October 21st, 2020.

      The 3-Stage in Zona 9, Guatemala City, Guatemala was the last known 3-Stage to still have a latex Jasper and a latex Pasqually. It was also the only known MMBB 3-Stage outside of the United States. It was also one of the only two known 3-Stages to feature a Chuck E. Cheese light from a 2-Stage, the light of which came from their removed 2-Stage. The 3-Stages in Lynnwood, Washington and Guatemala City featured a fiber optic sign that reads "Chuck E. Cheese" in color changing lights; they are the only known 3-Stages with this feature. They also had a big wooden platform in front of the stage used for live shows, an early building backdrop on the center stage, the flashing light on the TV on Pasqually's stage, 2-Stage buildings on Pasqually's stage that, once again, came from their removed 2-Stage, a unique shirt on Chuck, a Cyberamic dress on Helen, unique clothes for Pasqually and Munch's organ was placed incorrectly during the relocation from Ave. Reforma. It was further apart from him. The location closed in April 2016, and the 3-Stage animatronics and a few props were saved and are currently on display at the Condado Concepcion location, though Pasqually has a walkaround head over him. They are static.

      The 3-Stage in Laurel, Maryland is the last known 3-Stage to have a latex Pizzacam. It is also the only 3-Stage in state. As of 2021, like Springfield, Ohio, their air compressor broke, and the new one they bought is too small and not powerful enough to run the whole show. Only Chuck E. moved. But, as of November 2021, they got a new compressor capable of running the whole show. Now, all the animatronics (including Pizzacam) are able to move again.

      The 3-Stage in Springfield, Massachusetts was the only 3-Stage in the state and the New England region. The animatronics got replaced with the Cyberamics from the now closed Burlington, Massachusetts location in September 2017. Surprisingly, Jasper's banjo was kept intact, but Munch's cap was removed; the 2-Stage buildings were put on Chuck's stage as well. This location closed in June 2020.

Munch's keyboard has a personalized front with the initials "CEC" on it. Jasper's guitar was completely repainted to red, white and blue with a few extra ornamental features added.

In May 2020, they had the "In Pizza We Trust" slogan on their Wink. This stage's props and animatronics were removed for Joliet's Studio C Beta in July 2020, keeping the basic stage setup intact and only utilizing the Center Stage for the show.

The big screen TV next to Chuck has been removed, though the light extension on top was saved. Chuck E. also has his Rockstar outfit and walkaround shoes. The neon sign was moved to the left of Chuck. Pizzacam and Munch Jr. have been removed from the corporate stage, likely due to not having enough space and not being programmed at the time. Mr. Munch also has unique hair. The stage now more resembles a CU 1-Stage, rather than a 3-Stage.

      The 3-Stage in Charlotte, North Carolina (Pineville Matthews Rd) is one of four in the state. They no longer feature curtains, or Beach Bear’s guitar. They still have the “In Pizza We Trust” Wink. Munch’s organ has a unique front on it, similar to Huntsville, AL, with “CEC” initials and red, orange, and white stripes. In October, 2021, while the compressor was still broken, the technician put Chuck E.’s original 1990’s tuxedo back on the animatronic as a Halloween costume. However, when they fixed their compressor, the tux had to be removed so it didn’t rip.
