  <p key="12af3ad2-76a5-40f9-9c72-a5ddd5a5f249">
   The original concept for the stage was introduced in specific versions of the 2-Stage, to which there was no Fiber Optic sign nor TV screen to separate Chuck and the other band members. In May 1993, the first version of this stage, the decor, and the characters' outfits had different changes from the final version. These new changes included renaming the band to "Munch's Party Time Band" and giving Helen yellow hair (a staple she would soon take with this early version) and a roller skate costume, Munch, a tie, as well as retiring his hat, Jasper, a more punk rock look, and giving Pasqually a baseball outfit. This version was only in Department 18.
  </p>
  <p key="e61777c6-c15c-4e1f-96db-eada980a29eb">
   The first public 1-Stage was introduced in 1992/1993 with the finalized version installed in 1994 at Irving, Texas. It is a traditional CEC Stage that, as its name suggests, is a compact show that is restricted to the size of only one stage, as well as having simple bots to which were named "Cyberamics" in the early 1980s. The animatronic arrangement here is not unlike the other CEC Stages; Chuck E. Cheese, Helen Henny, Munch, Jasper, and Pasqually lined up from left to right in that order. The stage is unlike the usual Cyberamic MMBB stage, as it has a specific backdrop that implements two brick walls with either a fiberoptic sign or an MMBB logo sign (behind Chuck and Pasqually), as well as a more colorful version of the original rooftop buildings, seen initially on previous MMBB-styled stages. Originally, the stage had 2-Stage backdrops and was smaller before the finalized design was released in 1994. The show's size takes up very little of the Showroom floor, creating a simple and yet effective form of animatronic entertainment. An interesting thing to note with this stage is that some, but not all, 1-Stages have a unique feature, a turntable beneath the Chuck E. animatronic that rotates when the walkaround Chuck E. comes out for live shows or to mingle with the young guests. The feature was meant to avoid the confusion of seeing two Chuck E.'s, one on stage and one on the floor. The turntable, thus, solves this problem by creating the illusion that the animatronic Chuck E. came off the stage.
  </p>
  <p key="78c172f1-3f1b-4927-88d7-2d3fd1e86e03">
   Newer stages would soon rearrange around the different props featured in the final version that appeared at Irving. Soon, these brand new stages would take back the original outfits the characters wore earlier in the '90s and dropping features like the turntable. Irving, after their Phase 4 remodel, would also go through these changes.

It is also the only known 1-Stage outside of the United States, along with Mall Plaza Oeste, Chile, which has 2-Stage backdrops, and lacks the Wink, the star behind Chuck, spotlights, Pasqually's Amateur Hour sign and the MMBB sign. Jasper T. Jowls is also sitting on a real speaker, and the stage has PTT arm movements on Chuck and Helen, and it opened in 2011, being the last location to open with a 1-Stage. Both locations have the last Avenger hats on a 1-Stage. Lo Barnchea's 1-Stage is in a state of disrepair.

Coinciding with the playing showtape, the face will occasionally wink, often before an intermission or during another key moment in a showtape. The "ribbons" on the sides of Chuck E.'s head read at one time, "In Pizza We Trust", a slogan that also appeared on tokens, cups, and the sort.
