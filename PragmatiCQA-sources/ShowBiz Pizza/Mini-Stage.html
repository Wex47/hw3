   In 2003, a Mini Stage was purchased by
   Hillwood Strike and Spare
   in Nashville, Tennessee. Eventually, the stage stopped working, and was later put on static display in a state of disrepair. In 2015, the Funtown Mountain amusement park in Kentucky bought it, but later sold Billy Bob and Mitzi to a fan named Jack Turner, who completely restored them.

   Another surviving Mini-Stage is
   Billy Bob's Bear-a-dise Tropical Jamboree
   , which is a traveling show that performed at the Kentucky State Fair in 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016, the St. Joseph County Fair in South Bend, Indiana in 2013, and at the Big E Fair in Springfield, Massachusetts in 2015 and 2016.
   Aaron Fechter
   restored the show over the winter of 2016-17.
