   The game was supposed to be no holds barred. Anything would be allowed, even the killing of children. This was early in 1995, when something as innocuous as the word "ass" was considered unfit for public broadcasting. Interplay wanted to push the limits on the game, and in order to give more depth to some of the characters of the harsh environment, the language was spiced up.

   in a response to PC Gamer claimed that the reason the license was dropped was to avoid red tape and legal wrangling over the game's content, including
   Vault Boy
   , the violent introduction, and a small character scale.
   Similarly,
   Scott Campbell
   claimed in the
   that Steve Jackson Games was satisfied with everything but the
   Vault Boy
   pictures in the character screen and the execution scene in the

  <p key="b1270f85-23be-4327-beda-8d654b698141">
   However, Sean Punch, GURPS Line Editor at Steve Jackson Games, remarked in an
   that he is "skeptical of claims that a single cut scene, loading screen, dialog line, etc. caused the parting of ways".​ He has also stated that the issue that was cited as a reason for the abandoning of the license was "that the license didn't word the approval process in a way that was good for either party" and that it was ultimately easier to remake the RPG elements than rewrite the licensing agreement with all the legal wrangling involved.
   Urquhart did mention the vague approval process, which was a simple statement that Steve Jackson Games "had control over the environment in which the license would be used", in the aforementioned PC Gamer interview, supporting this notion.

  <p key="aef5777f-97c6-48c8-90e8-39c3b30ce5af">
   Regardless of the reason,
   Interplay
   claimed in an official statement that this was a mutually agreed decision, Steve Jackson, in a February 12, 1997, statement released through The Daily Illuminator on the Steve Jackson Games website stated that he wished he knew why Interplay decided to drop the license, and that no official correspondence to that effect was received by that date. It was a surprise to the

   developers had no vote in the matter.
   On March 14, 1997, Steve Jackson received a phone call confirming that GURPS was being dropped, as the development team was told to remove all licensed content and was too far along creating a replacement (

   ) and redoing art assets for them to return to GURPS. The caller laughed when Jackson asked to receive a confirmation in writing, saying that he would "see" if he could send a formal letter confirming this. The unilateral dropping of GURPS after three years of cooperation soured Jackson's relations with Interplay.

This talent, when it works, is excellent for spotting imposters, ghostly possession, and the like, and determining the true loyalties of NPCs.

      You tend to lose control of yourself under stress, making frenzied attacks against whoever or whatever you see as the cause of the trouble. Any time you take more than 3 hits in one turn, you must roll vs. IQ. A failed roll means you go berserk. Other conditions of extreme stress (GM's option) may also require an IQ roll to avoid berserking. A berserker may deliberately go berserk by taking the Concentrate maneuver and making a successful IQ roll.

       While berserk, you must make All-Out Attacks each turn a foe is in range, and Move as close as possible each turn no foe is in range. While berserk, you cannot be stunned, and injuries cause no penalty to your Move score or attack rolls. When your HT falls below zero, make a HT roll each turn; you do not fall until your body is totally destroyed (-10 × HT) or a roll is failed. You then fall unconscious – or, if your HT is fully negative (-1 × HT), dead! If you snap out of the berserk state, all your wounds immediately affect you, but no further HT rolls are necessary; if your HT is below 0, you simply collapse.

And a player who always tries to make this IQ roll may be judged guilty of bad roleplaying!

      You take pride in a set of principles which you follow at all times. Codes of honor differ, but all require (by their own standards) “brave” and “honorable” behavior. A Code of Honor may also be called “pride,” “machismo” or “face.” Under any name, it is the willingness to risk death rather than be thought dishonorable . . . whatever that means. Only one who truly follows the code may get points for it as a disadvantage. A Code of Honor is a disadvantage because it will often require dangerous (if not reckless) behavior. Furthermore, an honorable person can often be forced into unfair situations, because his foes know he is honorable

      This is the opposite of Combat Reflexes; you tend to freeze up in a combat situation. It's not worth more as a disadvantage, simply because most people who have it find out at an early age . . . and then steer away from careers in which they might face danger. This is not the same as cowardice; you don't have to roleplay fear. Your mind may be brave, but your body betrays you. In any situation in which personal harm seems imminent, roll against your HT. You do not roll until the instant in which you first need to fight, run, pull the trigger, etc. A successful roll means you can act normally. A failed roll means you are frozen, as though you'd been taken by surprise (see p. B106). You must roll every turn, at +1 to your effective HT each turn, to break the freeze. A quick slap from a friend will also give +1 to your cumulative chance of coming out of it. Once you unfreeze, you will not freeze again until the fight is over or you reach safety. Then you will again be susceptible to freezing, the next time danger threatens.

      The opposite of Truthfulness, the Compulsive Lying disadvantage forces the character to lie constantly, for no reason other than the joy of telling the tale. A compulsive liar delights in inventing stories about his deeds, lineage, wealth – whatever seems as though it might impress his audience. Even when exposed as a liar, the character will cling tenaciously to his stories, calling his accuser a liar and a scoundrel. In order to tell the pure, unvarnished truth, a compulsive liar must roll against IQ-4. A charitable GM might allow a liar to tell a slightly-fractured version of the truth if he only narrowly failed this roll. When a PC liar makes a roll to tell the truth to his fellow party members, he should roll out of sight of the other players. Thus, they can never be sure that they are getting accurate information from their comrade.

      There's one born every minute, and you're it. A gullible person naturally believes everything he hears; he'll swallow even the most ridiculous fish-story, if it's told with any conviction. In order to not believe a lie – or an improbable truth, for that matter – a gullible character must make a roll against IQ, modified by the plausibility of the story. A lie well-told, or involving something the character has no familiarity with – My father is the chief of police in this town, and he won't stand for this! – calls for a -6 penalty to the IQ roll. A lie concerning a topic the gullible character is familiar with – Didn't you know they bred ducks in your village, Torg? – calls for a -3 to the roll; and even a totally outlandish tale – Of course the Eskimos are descended from Spanish conquistadors; everyone knows that – will be believed if the character fails a roll against unmodified IQ. Furthermore, a gullible character suffers a -3 penalty on any Merchant skill roll, or in any situation in which his credulity might be exploited. A gullible person can never learn the Detect Lies skill.

Faced with unreasonable laws, you must roll against IQ to see the “need” to break them, and against Will to avoid turning yourself in afterward! If you ever behave dishonestly, the GM may penalize you for bad roleplaying. You are allowed to lie if it does not involve breaking the law. Truthfulness is a separate disadvantage.

      You suffer from a self-imposed feeling of duty. If you feel a sense of duty toward someone, you will never betray them, abandon them when they’re in trouble, or even let them suffer or go hungry if you can help. If you are known to have a sense of duty, others will react to you at a +2 to trust you in a dangerous situation. If you have a sense of duty, and go against it by acting against the interests of those you are supposed to feel duty toward, the GM will penalize you for bad roleplaying.

    Quirks

  </h3>
  <p key="a594dd46-ae1f-46dd-b637-9c4f444deae8">
   Quirks are additional elements that define a character in GURPS. While the game files contain an image referring to them explicitly, it is unknown if they would be implemented, given that certain quirks, like Delusions, have been folded into disadvantages.

   While the general gameplay between the games remains identical, there are some differences. For starters, the game
   for deciding on the type of interaction the player wanted to have with the target object or character.

  <p key="ba885f29-048a-4600-85ca-cd9c36619e1b">
   Another difference is that
   . This indicates that it was, at one time, possible to fire two single handed weapons (hence the

   advantage). Unlike the final product, where the player has two active item slots to use and allowed to freely switch between them, in the GURPS version the player would have to switch weapons by entering the inventory.
  </p>
  <p key="956623e1-61f3-4dc1-9cde-f8ab3335b8fc">
   The SkillDex was completely different and allowed the player to view all of the skills, advantages, and disadvantages in a separate window, apparently assign them to six different quick use slots, and access the character sheet (it was not accessible from the main interface bar).
  </p>
  <p key="e36d899d-a527-4c31-83d7-bd7d279282b7">
   Interestingly, the screens also indicate that the player would be able to directly select the skill to use in a given setting, as well as allow the game to choose it for them (the Auto setting).

  </h3>
  <p key="d756ec46-c310-4dd9-b3c6-6c5263f18006">
   Combat was majorly different, due to the use of Fatigue Points (FT) on top of Hit Points, as well as including disadvantages that can severely cripple the character in combat - including Combat Paralysis.
