   plays like a dungeon crawling run-and-gunner. There are very few NPCs that can be interacted with, and while the player can speak with them, the game aims to tell a mainly linear and fixed story so there are not dozens of branching paths, although there are a few consequences for some dialog choices. The game has
   quests
   and there are a few sidequests the player can do for rewards. While puzzles are absent for most of the game, chapter three has a few of them. The game also contains some light platforming elements such as jumping across bottomless pits and crouching under lasers which will instant kill the player.
   Skills
   have the same function as perks in other
   <i key="c46d94c8-9dfb-41fc-b5df-9605028e09a8">

   games. Each playable character has some skills that are unique to them.

  <p key="2340b673-e2dc-457e-80c3-7514e9fbdc48">
   The game allows for two-player co-op multiplayer. Due to no split screen, the players share the same screen and the players' boundaries are restricted by the camera, forcing the two players to stay close and move in tandem. Apart from multiplayer, the game does not feature companions except for a few moments where the player must follow an NPC; the one exception to this if the player unlocks the
   Man's Best Friend
   skill which allows a dog to follow the player and attack enemies. However, this skill is not available for Cain players.

       Brotherhood members have gone missing in Carbon, and the chosen Initiate is tasked with searching for the paladins, starting with the nearby town. The Initiate is welcomed by a prostitute,
       Ruby
       . Armed thugs loiter in town and harass
       Armpit
       , a bartender. Armpit is grateful the Initiate saves him, and steers the Initiate in the direction of the shifty mayor of this lawless town,
       Richard

       The mayor might be due some choice words from the electorate for the state of his town; one, in particular, will give the Initiate a discount as a reward for telling off the mayor. Even this outburst won't make the mayor reveal the location of the missing paladins. He insists the Initiate clear out an infestation of radscorpions in the nearby warehouse. The Initiate can collect the scorpion tails and whatever contents of the warehouse that aren't nailed down, which Armpit is interested in buying. When all the giant, radioactive, and the more common mutated scorpions are all rendered lifeless, the Initiate returns to the mayor. The mayor reveals the missing paladins headed off in the direction of a massive crater outside of town.

       Following the trail to the bottom, the Initiate finds that the mayor was threatened by the raiders who seek revenge for the ones killed in the bar; lure the Initiate on the outskirts so they can be killed, or have Carbon be burned to the ground. The mayor then turns homicidal as well, mentioning that he is not normally a violent man, but the thought of killing the Initiate seems enjoyable. Mayor Richard has more explosives on him than anyone really ought to be able to carry, and is determined to unload as much of it as possible in the Initiate's vicinity. Despite this, the end result is the mayor's demise. The Initiate returns to the town.

       The raiders have given up loitering in favor of looting. Their leader,
       Jane
       , shows her sadistic side by ordering her men to burn Armpit to death. Many of the citizens of the town have fled; one who couldn't make it to their refuge in the recently cleared warehouse requests the Initiate's aid in saving them. But first, there are a total of 37 citizens scattered throughout the town areas. Should they be saved by the Initiate, the
       wasteland stranger
       will be very grateful indeed, to the tune of a
       Red Ryder LE BB gun
