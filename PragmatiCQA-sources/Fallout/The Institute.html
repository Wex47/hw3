   The Institute was built upon what was once known as the
   Commonwealth Institute of Technology
   , or C.I.T.
   While the college itself laid in ruins for more than two centuries, at the time of the
   <a href="Great War.html" key="3f8e20b6-4816-457a-bc3a-52d352ca4a91" title="Great War">
    Great War
   </a>
   , those present took refuge underground.
   The Institute was formally founded by the children of the original survivors, who dug into the earth and built increasingly sophisticated residential facilities and laboratories, starting an ongoing process of infrastructure expansion.
  </p>
  <p key="2c6bf1ec-a5fe-4226-8e04-eeaacbf4956b">
   Isolated from the outside world, the scientists continued their work, disregarding the mayhem and destruction occurring outside of its grounds. As they worked on creating synths, they attempted to work peacefully with the people of the Commonwealth using first generation synths as well as help create a new stabilized government, but mutual mistrust and infighting ended that relationship quickly and they returned to isolation.
   Eventually, the scientists have utterly put ubiquitous pre-War technology to shame,
   to the point where they believed that wastelanders would be unlikely to understand the sheer scope of the Institute's achievement,
   such as the creation of the molecular relay (teleporter) in the 2180s,
   which resulted in the Institute sealing itself off from the surface permanently,
   and the development of synths. For decades, the first and second generation synths were the most visible part of the Institute's operations, scavenging for materials and performing experiments on the wasteland. The scientists, sealed away in their utopian society, did not concern themselves with the plight of the surface or the effect their actions had on the surface.
  </p>
  <p key="c75acb19-1a3c-42fb-b129-e3c0f6af7c0a">
   However, the Institute eventually reached the limits of the synth technology that underpinned their society. Although powerful, the second generation synth was an inherently limited, mechanical platform. To overcome the limitations of metal synthetic materials, the Institute endeavored to create synthetic flesh, with the first research initiative beginning in 2178. Under the auspices of
   Doctor Frederick
   ,
   <a href="Forced Evolutionary Virus.html" key="a78ddbd0-d902-4a09-89a8-cbbb8d37068e" title="Forced Evolutionary Virus">
    FEV
   </a>
   samples served as the starting point for the new, organic synthetic program despite the objections of some members of BioScience.
   Both women and men were abducted from the Commonwealth and submerged in the Institute's modified FEV, their mutations carefully tracked and extensively investigated. Successful mutations would be monitored to ensure survivability, then tagged and discarded.
   Research ground to a halt in March 2224, as the research team concluded that the organic synth project could not proceed despite perfecting two FEV strains for the project. Radiation-induced hereditary damage proved too much of an obstacle.
  </p>
  <p key="e97d2280-7746-4857-a964-72c3c9d95443">
   The solution came in 2227, with to the acquisition of
   <a href="Shaun.html" key="bfc13767-c90a-4d0f-aa8c-538111880fea" title="Shaun">

   and his undamaged pre-War genetic code. The organic synth project was spun off from the FEV research initiative,
   and his DNA became the basis of the third generation synths. The infant Shaun became "Father" to a whole family of engineered synthetic beings. In 2229, a defective synth caused the
   Broken Mask Incident
   in
   Diamond City
   , vilifying the Institute in the eyes of the Commonwealth,
   and causing no small amount of internal problems for the Institute, as he was sent out without proper testing or approval.
  </p>
  <p key="9172e1a0-b69b-4b3d-93d6-e22af72c1635">
   The FEV research effort continued for several more decades, despite producing no useful data; except for manufacturing more super mutants for the surface to contend with.
   When
   Brian Virgil
   succeeded
   Dr. Syverson
   as head of the project in April 2286, it became evident that FEV experimentation ran its course and served no useful purpose, not with the availability of third generation synths.
   The Institute's experiments with the Forced Evolutionary Virus, or FEV, ended when Doctor Virgil went rogue and fled into the Commonwealth.
  </p>
  <p key="739bf219-00d8-43a2-92ac-6fe2a1a585a5">
   But even with the organic synth project complete, the Institute did not rest on its laurels. Work continues in other fields, its sophistication increasing with every day. Of course, with this increase comes an increased appetite for energy; the Institute is constantly facing shortages in its power budget, in no small part due to the fact that the molecular de-materializer (the only way in and out of the facility) requires immense amounts of power for each use.
   Moreover, despite the luster of the Institute's facilities, a lot of the crucial facilities (particularly the reactor) are pre-War technology and despite continued maintenance requires increasing amounts of resources to keep running after two centuries of expansion.
   The technology still holds up, as it was built to last.
  </p>
  <p key="fa4b5e73-8803-47ec-9fba-d2a66124ebf2">
   To overcome at least one problem, the ultimate goal of the Institute is energy independence, which they believe can be achieved by restarting the ancient nuclear reactor once used by the C.I.T. to perform experiments and providing the Institute with near limitless power.
   The design has been revised and the reactor itself extensively upgraded and improved, turning it from a testing reactor into a proper source of electricity.
   Activating it would free the Institute from the need to compromise and sacrifice,
   and especially drawing power from above-ground installations.

   Over the decades of isolation and development, the Institute has developed a very effective system that maximizes efficiency and promotes individual development and research. The leadership over the Institute is in the hands of the directorate, made up of the individual heads of each division, and one specially-appointed director.
   The divisions of the Institute are fairly autonomous, perfectly capable of functioning without intervention. Where those divisions interact, however, problems can arise. As such, the director is appointed to set policy, resolve disputes, and otherwise act as an intermediary.

   Each director heads a division that is instrumental to the Institute's continued existence. Yet despite the pressing need to cooperate, knowledge is heavily compartmentalized and the divisions kept in the dark.
   Inconvenient facts are routinely buried under false pretenses, especially when it comes to high-profile members fleeing the organization, like Dr. Brian Virgil.

All the old technology that forms the foundation of the Institute's efforts requires constant maintenance to prevent blackouts, which can have lethal consequences for the sequestered society.
   In a nutshell, they keep the Institute's mechanical and electrical systems running smoothly. They maintain and upgrade all of the systems that make it possible to live and work in a place like the Institute's underground habitat: Crucial apparatus that recycles the air and water and provides power to the laboratories and quarters. The work they do might not be as exciting as some of the other departments, but it's at least as important.

   , the SRB was designed to perform one task: it tracks down and returns rogue synths to the Institute. To do this, the Institute created a specific synth model called the
   Courser
   . Coursers have their personality levels tweaked to ensure they won't rebel, while their combat abilities have been vastly improved over other models. Other divisions within the Institute fear the SRB, as they have a hit squad of Coursers under their command and they are very effective in their role. The SRB also works to hunt down

   members so they can shut down the rebel organization once and for all. The SRB also employs a murder, or flock, of "Watchers," synthetic crows with built-in monitoring devices. Synths are the primary labor force of the Institute,
   but the more advanced their processing becomes, the more inevitable that the synth will attain consciousness and attempt escape.
   As third generation synths are indistinguishable from normal biological
   humans
   ,
   the Synth Retention Bureau specializes in the capture of runaways.
  </p>
  <p key="d073a134-4414-4ec5-81b6-243cd4113198">
   The primary instrument of the SRB is the Courser, a third-generation synth assigned to operate on the surface. Coursers hunt down and reclaim synths that have escaped the Institute. They are highly self-sufficient, trained in combat, infiltration, and tracking. In a word, Coursers are relentless.
   Coursers are selected from the general third generation synth population. Due to the variability of the manufacturing process, the SRB constantly monitors the third generation population looking for tenacity, fearlessness, and independence. Synths selected to undergo a rigorous training regimen. They are taught armed and unarmed combat, investigative techniques, psychology, and mechanical skills. Those who pass a final evaluation become Coursers, re-registered as X synths (eg.
   X6-88
   ). The rest have their memories wiped and return to their former duties.
  </p>
  <p key="3081263b-103e-4ebb-99e6-e966c8fdd008">
   Synths are usually recovered by using a recall code to wipe their memories and render it inert. Once returned to the Institute, the delicate process of restoring the neural pathways to their original configuration begins. In those cases where the procedure is successful, the synth returns to duty with no memory of its time on the surface. All too often, the SRB staff is unable to repair the damage and is forced to dispose of the unit entirely.
  </p>
  <p key="b26413e6-4093-4df1-9602-eb596038570c">
   Another priority of the SRB is surveillance, achieved by using
   watchers
   to monitor the surface remotely and covertly.

   Despite the Institute's prowess, there are a limited amount of scientists at its disposal, with a small team working with each division and several auxiliary scientists elsewhere. As a result, the Institute requires relatively little housing space and has apartments to accommodate all scientists and their families.
  </p>
  <p key="4fb66f14-46d2-44e7-bb13-a08335ecef26">
   Scientists interact regularly and often spend time inside the cafeteria and main chamber. Despite its secrecy, the Institute maintains a friendly and welcoming demeanor to those introduced into its ranks and allows access to almost every area inside the facility to newcomers. There appear to be no strict work hours for most scientists, as they often take many hours off and come and go as they please from meals.

  </h2>
  <p key="aae14c39-14f4-488e-9b30-9ed865ef6015">
   The Institute is very secretive of the projects occurring within its organization and seeks to keep as much information internally as possible. This leads to it limiting outside contact as much as possible without compromising the security of the facility.
   Of course, security is an exception and the Institute's SRB operates a network of informants in the entire Commonwealth, monitoring developments to ensure they cannot threaten the Institute.
  </p>
  <p key="2f80c935-b63c-4056-a6f1-139f266056a5">
   Another exception is its scientific experiments. While it seeks to minimize direct contact, the Institute has no reservations about using the surface for its experiments and as a source of readily available raw materials. All research initiatives are meticulously documented with academic precision, from hypothesis to the conclusions. For example:
   Warwick homestead
   was targeted to test genetically-modified seeds in the unique climate of the Commonwealth, in order to ascertain whether ambient radiation, soil acidity and its fertility found there could provide an accelerated growth rate and a two-fold increase in size and thus yield.
   Though ostensibly harmless, the research initiative involved abducting
   Roger Warwick
   and processing him to gain intelligence, then using Roger's
   replica
   to oversee the experiment, collect research data and eventually eliminate all evidence of the research initiative on the surface.
   The Institute's activities on the surface go beyond agricultural research. Past projects also involved other bioengineered experiments, including diseases and FEV-induced mutations. Abductions remain a routine element of these research activities.
  </p>
  <p key="2c970df8-94b5-47f8-8f07-42e6d10dab46">
   Finally, anyone who holds anything of value to the Institute, especially technology and research data, are vulnerable.
   University Point
   was an example of this: When
   Jacqueline Spencer
   uncovered pre-War research on reactor efficiency and tried to find a buyer via a caravan, the Institute picked up the trail and a synth representative demanded that the town hand it over. When the settlement failed to comply, due to the chaos that broke out and Spencer being separated from the drive by her well-intentioned father, the SRB wiped the town out.
   The Institute also attempts to procure data from rival polities, like the Brotherhood, whenever it can, in order to maintain its technological advantage.

  <p key="b226cd8c-a1d4-440e-a381-8c0a7b3c2edd">
   The principal foe of the Institute in 2287 is the

    Brotherhood of Steel
   </a>
   , which is ideologically opposed to the activities of the Institute. The Institute seeks ways to counter the Brotherhood without forcing a decisive confrontation.
   <a href="The Railroad.html" key="92578111-3b33-4bf9-892e-fc8640ebc8f3" title="The Railroad">
    The Railroad
   </a>
   is a threat of secondary importance, targeted mostly to minimize the disruption of Institute operations and preserve the secrecy of its activities. While
   Railroad sympathizers
   are suspected to operate within the Institute, internal security doesn't devote much resources to rooting them out, as while they are ideologically opposed to each other, they are considered a minor nuisance in general.
  </p>
  <p key="899a6497-6475-474b-aac4-c04174aecc75">
   Threats such as super mutants or raider gangs are of a tertiary nature, usually given a wide berth by Institute operatives, rather than confronted directly.

   While the Institute is primarily a scientific group, it has a powerful army at its disposal: synths.
  </p>
  <p key="2b968d20-bafc-4480-980c-b2d8a46e4cd2">
   Inside the main HQ of the Institute, the Robotics division can produce very large numbers of synthetic organisms, which can be very efficient foot soldiers with enhanced strength and resilience. This, coupled with the advanced technology at their disposal, makes the Institute's synths a serious threat to anyone who dares to oppose them. Generation 1 and 2 synths serve as the backbone of forces, equipped with variants of the
   Institute laser
   gun,
   shock batons
   , and
   synth armor
   .
  </p>
  <p key="cf9cdb72-5213-4a02-963b-9312a81b4377">
   Coursers are a particular type of Generation 3 synth with higher military capability, used as special agents to pursue and recover lost synths, and as special forces. They are trained and deployed by the Synth Retention Bureau. Coursers are equipped with variants of the Institute laser gun, the signature
   Courser coat
   , and
   synth relay grenades
   that allow them to teleport Generation 1 synths to help them in combat. They commonly utilize
   Stealth Boys
   .
  </p>
  <p key="1f3d3537-32b8-4242-9338-d48abb38a266">
   They maintain an information network to assist them in strategy. The Synth Retention Bureau maintains a fleet of watchers, synth crows with internal cameras. From the SRB, scientists monitor live feeds from locations all across the Commonwealth with these. The SRB also inserts synth agents into positions of importance (such as the
   mayor
   of Diamond City and the leader of a successful homestead) and maintains a network of paid informants, such as merchants and bartenders.
  </p>
  <p key="afa4bad4-a1de-4c2f-a5ee-6b0466e2ac76">
   They are the only faction in the Commonwealth with access to teleportation, and this is a military advantage. They can attack a location with zero warning at any time and leave before backup arrives. For this reason, they excel at hit-and-run tactics.

   The Institute is one of the most technologically advanced factions in the wasteland. Their primary and most notable achievement is the ability to field an army of synthetic entities and eliminate the need for menial labor, with the latest third generation models being not only indistinguishable from humans, but also immune to disease, able to subsist on minimal energy intake without loss of performance, and do not require sleep.
   Moreover, the Institute can assemble them at a rapid pace within its Robotics laboratory, from scratch.
   The Institute has constructed an entire subterranean habitat after the Great War when most humans struggle and get by with shacks and tents. Not only that, but it can also manufacture its own energy weapons and advanced armor in numbers large enough to outfit all of its security forces.
   Furthermore, it uses genetically modified crops to provide sustenance for its researchers.
   As a result, safe, pure water and food is also commonly available to all members of the Institute. Food synthesizers help provide a balanced diet, with additional luxury goods scavenged by synths from the topside, such as Nuka-Cola, Gwinnett beer and coffee among others.
  </p>
  <p key="2cffe0ca-4d3a-41ce-b51f-e5e45e587210">
   The Institute had a large advantage, having emerged out of the ashes of one of the most advanced centers of research and development in the world. Most of its achievements are still deeply rooted in the C.I.T. For example, its security system architecture is derived from the C.I.T.
   Code Defender
   , a revolutionary intrusion countermeasure system developed before the Great War. Terminals running the original version of the system still remain in the Institute's inventory, despite advances made by the
   SRB
   .
  </p>
  <p key="8b05755d-eb20-4c2a-95f2-807f38bd3b48">
   Another impressive achievement of the Institute is its development of teleportation technology. The only other factions known to possess
   similar technology
   are
   the Think Tank
   and the
   Zetan aliens
   .
   Unlike the Think Tank, however, the Institute is able to teleport multiple individuals in rapid succession.

   In the past, the Institute has also dabbled in cybernetics and artificial prolongation of the human lifespan. Its only test subject was
   Conrad Kellogg
   , as the program was abandoned and forgotten, save for the jealousy the grizzled mercenary inspired in Institute scientists due to his life span.

    After becoming the director, various members of the Institute will remark on how the player should approve new policies, make some reforms and reconsider priorities. However, none of those are available in the game and at best suggest what the player will be doing in the future.
