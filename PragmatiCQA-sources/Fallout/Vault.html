   resulted in a nation-wide scare. In response, the government set Project Safehouse in motion in 2054. This massive national defense endeavor was intended to create shelters that would protect the population in the event of a nuclear war or plague. Breakthroughs in construction techniques allow for these gargantuan bunkers to be constructed at a rapid pace.
   The impoverished government is forced to finance the project with
   junk bonds
   and even then, only commissions well over 100 of these shelters nationwide,
   allowing less than 0.1% of the population to save their life in the event of the holocaust. The sheer costs of a single Vault are staggering. The intended budget for

   </a>
   was $400 billion dollars, and by the end of its construction, the total costs reached $645 billion, well over 150% of the initial figure.
   As a crucial element of national defense, much of the project was classified and protected under the
   New Amended Espionage Act
   , encouraging embezzlement and corruption.
   Installations built as part of the Vault-Tec Societal Preservation Program commonly claimed to have a chance to fail equal to 1,763,497 to 1; however, the reality was a far cry from this bold claim.

   The building of the shelters proceeded rapidly and most were completed by 2063. The construction of several Vaults was delayed, particularly Vault 13 (which only started construction in August 2063) and the network surrounding

   .
   Some were delayed due to work stoppage.
   Ongoing drills in completed shelters were mandatory,  with some Vaults having up to five drills a week, including nightly tests.
   The drills were known as "Beta Alert" days, as indicated by the Vault-Tec early warning system, but residents would start being admitted only in the events of an actual "Alpha Alert" when the war was detected as right about to start.
   These repeated drills however slowly created a "cry wolf" effect. Turnouts for the drills fell as the years went on, further limiting the Vaults' role in ensuring the survival of humanity.

   Additional problems were caused by consistent mismanagement, corruption, and embezzlement that seemed to define Project Safehouse before the war. Yet for all these problems, Vault-Tec was able to create a number of miracle technologies and develop shelters that really protected the inhabitants, as long as they worked properly.
   Vault-Tec even advertised Vaults in newly annexed

   , though these were in the early stages of completion.
   The company sponsored an exhibit at the
   Museum of Technology
   in the capital, designed to promote their shelters and explain their functionality.
   Promotional tours and awarding of prizes like the
   Pressed Vault Suit Award
   were also used to promote a positive image of the company.

   On October 23, 2077, the Great War came. The Vault-Tec air raid sirens blared, but the "cry wolf" effect results in few people going into the shelters. They were sealed and the experiments entered their decisive phase. The control Vaults functioned as intended and protected their populations. Others were not so lucky.

   Designed to last generations,
   a typical Vault is built deep underground in a geologically stable area (typical choices include mountain ranges
   and remote areas away from population centers),
   but such shelters have also been built below the foundations of modern cities
   in order to survive the effects of a nuclear blast.
   Vault-Tec's method was patented as the Triple-S Technology (Safety, Survivability and Sanitation),
   to provide a maximum of comfort to the inhabitants without compromising their safety. Vaults were typically built using reinforced concrete and solid metal sheeting to ensure the durability and longevity of the shelter construction.
   The primary protection came in the sheer amount of earth covering:

   </a>
   was shielded by 3 200 000 tons of soil, at 200 feet (60m) of thickness,
   while Vault 88 was sheltered by granite deposits common to
   Quincy
   .
  </p>
  <p key="ec237be8-8777-4e61-8c22-0783eaa8f843">
   The precise method of constructing Vaults evolved greatly as Vault-Tec accumulated experience in constructing these vast underground shelters. The first shelters were built using contemporary technologies, combining prefabricated elements with poured concrete and modular machines and electronics.

   , which used the same kind of technology used for military and industrial construction, such as

    corporate research facilities
   </a>
   .
   Vault-Tec quickly started implementing its own, purpose-built technologies. Vaults started becoming more and more modular, using entire prefabricated sections built to spec on the factory floor and assembled on site. Many second-generation shelters exhibited a combination of both old and new technologies, with the only fully next-generation Vaults built on the East Coast, in
   Boston
   and

   .
   These were built entirely using prefabricated sections complete with all the necessary infrastructure, fixtures, and fittings, greatly reducing construction times.
  </p>
  <p key="79d6c82d-2155-495a-a448-53da31d4f085">
   By 2077, Vault-Tec could rapidly construct Vaults, especially in areas where natural or artificial features such as stable cave networks or underground tunnels permitted it. For example, the stability of Quincy's granite quarries and the ground allowed extensive excavation operations, creating a network of natural and artificial caves. After reinforcement, these caves were connected to a temporary railroad that rapidly delivered all the necessary prefabricates, construction equipment, and other necessities.

   In order to power the entire installation, Vaults were provided with a variety of power sources, depending on local geology and the actual size of the Vault (with the average being approximately 220 dwellers).
   The largest of them, like

   , required nearly 3.98 MWh/day for continued operations for its 1000 occupants. In order to meet the demand, the shelter used a geothermal power plant as a primary source, with
   General Atomics
   nuclear power as backup.
   Infrastructure is designed for durability, but also for convenience. Critical elements are usually hidden behind wall panels so as to keep them out of harm's way.

   The usual go-to solution was geothermal power, in areas where it was practical. If not, the usual fallback option was the aforementioned
   General Atomics
   nuclear power plant, often used as the primary power source due to its reliability and scalability. Concrete, steel reinforcements, and SimuSun lighting were also utilized. Vaults are known to use the systems listed below.

   All of that power was necessary to power the facilities necessary to sustain the people living within. Apart from air filtration systems required to keep the air breathable, Vaults also included hydro-agricultural farms and food synthesizers to provide sustenance,
   water purification systems (able to take even sewer waste and convert it into up to 15,000 gallons of drinkable water each day with no loss of output for 250,000 hours of operation),
   and other necessary amenities, like a Vault-wide intranet allowing instant access to any entertainment, social, and educational files from any terminal in the Vault.
   Vaults were also equipped with incinerators for disposal of the dead and likely other waste products.
   Security was provided by hydraulic duty doors an extensive network of

   As the government only commissioned 122 Vaults as part of
   Project Safehouse
   , only a fraction of the 400 million U.S. citizens would actually be accepted into the Vaults.
   The duration of stay varied. Some shelters were only intended to stay sealed for ten years (

   The Enclave eventually abandoned their goal of settling on another planet and decided to resettle the one they already had. Vault monitoring and research continued as the Vault Behavioral Project.
   In order to monitor the populations being experimented upon, the Enclave's oil rig possessed a great deal of equipment that allowed them to observe and control the vaults. For example, the Enclave sent the all clear signal to
   <a href="Vault 8.html" key="fb23ab24-3aa7-4b9a-bb84-b7878f112900" title="Vault 8">
    Vault 8

   shortly after the war, prompting them to leave the shelter and build their city. These monitoring tools also let the Enclave see that the population of Vault 13 was largely intact, although this wouldn't become important until much later.

  <p key="f312f834-cb8b-4f6f-8758-780c61248785">
   Pre-selected segments of the population accepted into Vault-Tec's shelters would enjoy a very high quality of life, though it would be completely different from the free market capitalist consumerism experienced on the surface - a planned socialist utopia underground (giving China the last laugh). As a closed system, the Vaults were designed to recycle and reuse
   as much as possible and implement a completely planned economy that would maintain the system for the planned duration of the Vault. Every inhabitant would be registered with a unique 11 digit Vault identification number called VID,
   and provided with clothing, bedding, and other accommodations necessary for their life within the vault.
  </p>
  <p key="82b3aa33-651b-4064-92d2-6c0059ebb75c">
   The only exception was food and water, as these could only be procured with the proper ration coupons (at least in some Vaults).
   Luxury, non-essential goods were available for purchase in exchange for work credits, a form of currency earned through performing work for the Vault. The aforementioned ration coupons would sometimes also be used as a form of currency.
   Nourishment would be provided by a combination of food grown in hydroponic farms, like in Vault 13, or food synthesizers, capable of creating a variety of foodstuffs. Water would be provided by purifying liquid drawn from the local water table.

   It is important to note that Vault dwellers would be unable to use their own clothing in the long term. While dwellers could arrange to have their belongings sent to their quarters in advance, there was a strict policy disallowing bringing baggage along in case of an emergency entrance.
   The uniform
   Vault jumpsuit
   would replace regular clothes. Manufactured inside the Vault, it was designed for utility and comfort. Enterprising dwellers could, however, customize theirs to add a bit of individuality to the generally conformist design.
   Planning and conformity also extended to other areas. For example, trash disposal would only be permitted in designated receptacles on pre-set trash burning days. These receptacles would also be used for the disposal of corpses, as there was no space for proper burial in the confined environment of the Vault.
   Preteen dwellers would also potentially be assigned work duties,

   In exchange for these sacrifices in lifestyle, dwellers would receive private quarters provided with the latest in home appliances, including Floorsuck Autocleaner Systems to minimize sweeping,
   Culinator 3000 Kitchen Systems for cooking,
   and access to complete libraries of social and entertainment files
   together with the public Entertainotron room.
   A standardized education would be received by all Vault dwellers, including schooling in arithmetic, chemistry, biology, history, and other sciences.
   Tertiary education would also be provided and Vault-trained specialists would be highly sought after the apocalypse and count on a stable career in their chosen field, like
   Doc Mitchell
   from

   Their health would be assured by well-educated doctors with access to the latest in medical technologies.
   Auto-Docs
   capable of performing a broad variety of procedures and manufacturing medical
   drugs
   were the standard issue of the Emergency Medical Labs (which were equipped well enough to rival clinics).
   Some Vaults were also equipped with facilities for
   cloning
   replacement tissue and organs.
   To avoid the development of medical problems, shelters were lit using a
   Simu-Sun
   lighting system simulating natural sunlight.
   It was estimated that living in a properly maintained Vault would result in an average lifespan of 92.3 years.
   Of course, prolonged isolation, even in generations born after entry, took its toll.
   Vault depressive syndrome
   was a common problem, manifesting as intense depression that could be debilitating. The usual recourse was to prescribe and treat it with anti-anxiety medication.
   Furthermore, those who exited successful Vaults seem to have a heightened chance of suffering from xenophobia (fear of strangers) and/or agoraphobia (fear of open places).

   Living quarters were typically located deeper into the Vault and their design varied by the installation. A standard level had 20,000 square feet of usable area.
   The standard approach was to provide discrete apartments to Vault couples, provided with a private sanitary compartment, terminal, and a bed, on top of any additional amenities they may require.

   and the security post with the Vault's main armory. The workplace of the overseer would typically be located in an area overlooking the atrium - the center of activity within the Vault, where dwellers would spend their leisure time, socialize, and even engage in sports such as soccer, baseball, and other games.
