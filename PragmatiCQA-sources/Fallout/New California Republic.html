   The NCR emphasizes and strives to support a plethora of old world values, such as democracy, personal liberty, and the rule of law. It also aims to restore general order to the wasteland, the improvement and development of infrastructure and economic systems, and overarching peace between people.
   Similar to institutions of the old world it seeks to emulate, continued expansion has created challenges with territorial control, loyalty, and corruption that plague the Republic and serve to hinder its goals. The NCR is often criticized by residents of the Mojave wasteland as well as other factions for being hawkish, imperialistic, poorly managed and over-extended in the region, and trying to attempt to emulate old world values that led to nuclear holocaust in the first place.

   Less than a century after its founding, the Republic is a model example of post-apocalyptic success and good ethics. Steady expansion and development led to widespread political enfranchisement, the establishment of rule of law and its enforcement, security from threats within and without (to a reasonable degree) and good standards of living (above mere subsistence, at minimum) are a reality for its massive population of over 700,000 citizens.
   The situation improved even further with the
   Mojave Campaign
   and securing the flow of electricity and water from
   Hoover Dam
   to the Republic. However, the protracted campaign has come at a cost.
  </p>
  <p key="fc04ad83-9862-417a-8187-dba32da68072">
   The death of President Tandi, who cherished the humanitarian values upon which the Republic was founded, resulted in marked changes in its character. The NCR in 2281 is in a period of transition, experiencing rapid economic growth and dramatic political changes, endangering its original grand ideals. Nowhere is that more evident than in the morally corrosive, imperialist
   Mojave Campaign
   , championed by President Aaron Kimball and aiming for the unilateral annexation of the city of
   New Vegas
   as the sixth state of the Republic. Years of campaigning led to a stalemate, locking NCR as the protector of New Vegas from Caesar's Legion, without a single cap in tax revenue from the
   New Vegas Strip
   or concessions from
   Robert House
   , proprietor of the New Vegas Strip, who is content to abide by the terms of the
   Treaty of New Vegas
   and use the 5% of the dam's output for their own ends. This left the Republic overstretched and weighed down with bureaucracy, unable to properly supply its campaign, the direct result of both General Oliver's insistence on massing troops and resources at Hoover Dam and Camp McCarran at the expense of the rest of the Republic's Mojave garrison and the NCR Senate having cut funding to the Mojave Campaign. Meanwhile, NCR citizens continue to come to the Mojave Wasteland, either as traders, fortune seekers or citizen-soldiers fighting for the Republic, swelling New Vegas' economy while dwindling the NCR's.

   The flag of the New California Republic is directly inspired by the state
   flag of California
   , which depicts a California grizzly bear on a patch of grass.
   The NCR would adopt a version of this flag during the formative years as a nation. The first iteration of the flag would be largely different, but similar in design to the California state flag.

   The first flag of the Republic, seen in

   , with the abbreviation "NCR" behind it, as well as the entire state of California, and a single red star with the upper left corner, and underlined by a thin red bar. By
   2281
   , a simpler design more directly resembling the California state flag is used, the chief differences being the two-headed grizzly bear and the amended caption of "

  <p key="c587f24a-b430-4c1e-8eda-be11ad8e0db9">
   Abstractly, the NCR represents progress; while tribals and other wastelanders scratch out a meager existence, citizens of the NCR enjoy the wasteland luxuries of a steady economy, healthcare, laws and legitimate government, not to mention the largest military to ensure they have a shot at more than just survival.
   The massive population of the New California Republic means it is composed of a highly diverse number of individuals, from highly refined inhabitants of the Republic's grand urban centers, through merchants and frontier settlers, to the large numbers of farmers and ranchers responsible for its economic might.
  </p>
  <p key="57337626-637f-44b4-8315-c5d48ba8d4cc">
   That economic power was one of the key factors in the transformation of society between 2241 and 2281. As survival ceased being a major concern for the vast majority of NCR citizens, the problem of collective welfare has been largely superseded by concerns about individual prosperity. People providing services free of charge are now the exception, rather than the rule, with skilled workers routinely charging for their services, from tailors to surgeons. Moreover, after over 80 years of scavenging, the wastelands of New California have been largely picked clean of salvageable goods. NCR citizens who can still make a living exclusively by scavenging and hunting are an uncommon sight. The combination of these cultural and economic factors led to the rebirth of wage labor: Most citizens have to seek an employer at a mill, factory or farm and work to earn their keep and earn money necessary to survive.
   But these jobs are easy to find in one of the many mills and farms in New California.
  </p>
  <p key="8d7bcf0a-6195-47c1-af3e-067941a2c295">
   The citizens themselves hold a variety of opinions on these developments. While many praise the economic strength hammered out in the furnaces of the wasteland, many others decry the loss of communal spirit. Some will even curse the selfishness of other citizens, usually while pursuing goals that are just as selfish. One thing is common: The belief that opportunity has largely dried up at home and real fortunes await further east.

   The Republic prohibits persecution and discrimination on the basis of gender, ethnicity,
   sexuality
   or
   religious
   belief (so long as said religion does not advocate violence). Since 2205, it also protects ghouls and mutants, though enforcement of these rights has been uneven (even as far as 2281, one can find
   super mutants tortured by NCR citizens with impunity
   or
   politicians who make a career out of anti-mutant bigotry
   ).
   In general, the Republic is successful in its enforcement of equality laws. However, since the death of President Tandi and the election of President Kimball, there has been some retrenchment. The reactionary undercurrent, especially among males, led to a disproportionately high number of promotions for male military officers, while discourse arguing the differences between males and females has reappeared.
   This extends even to active combat zones where female troopers are called out of high alert areas despite need of troops or skill.
   Regardless of the setbacks, slavery is outlawed in all NCR territories, with the exception of forced prison labor.
   Homosexuality is generally accepted in the core states of the Republic, though frontier territories away from the more civilized center tend to show prejudice.
  </p>
  <p key="15abaa08-039e-4b5b-8bf5-822c18ce4626">
   During her long presidency, Tandi enacted legislation that limited the number of cattle head and the acreage of fields that could be owned by a single person, limiting the power of the
   Stockmen's Association
   and the
   Republican Farmer's Committee
   . Following her death, the restrictions were slowly eroded by each new president and finally overturned during the presidency of Aaron Kimball. As a result, wealthy farmers and ranchers (commonly known as
   brahmin barons
   ) exert a disproportionate amount of influence, despite having just one vote on paper.

   The NCR's free market
   economy is based on two resources, ever since its inception: Great
   brahmin
   herds and vast swaths of land restored to arable condition. Providing meat, leather, milk and other foodstuffs, which are the backbone of the economy of the Republic. As a result, ranchers and farmers hold great sway. During Tandi's presidency, anti-cartel regulations were implemented to limit the acreage and brahmin head one man could control. However, with her death, pressure from the Stockmen's Association and the Republican Farmer's Committee certainly helped erode them, until President Kimball overturned them completely. As a result, since
   2241
   much of the Republic's farming and brahmin herding has been monopolized by brahmin and
   agricultural barons
   , incredibly wealthy individuals who exert a lot of influence thanks to their money. Their success also led to the emergence of cottage industries, such as the rebirth of luxury goods manufacture and pseudo-journalism reporting on the latest purchases, commissions and life lessons of the new rich and famous.
  </p>
  <p key="9ea116c8-25c3-4749-81dd-469e7189ab24">
   Other branches of industry have also developed. Light industry, including tools, clothes making, mills and other manufacturing, form a significant part of the Republic's industrial output.
   Another element of the Republic's economy is its ordnance workshops, producing standardized weapons and armor for the New California Republic Army and Rangers.
  </p>
  <p key="b6937166-b444-41c0-bbe4-a03f75f1f8c2">
   The ever-expanding trade routes led to the rise of powerful merchant houses, such as the
   Crimson Caravan
   , the
   Far Go Traders
   and the
   Gun Runners
   , which continue to all but completely dominate all trade within New California. Lucrative government contracts for weapons, ammunition, armor, and other necessities fueling the Republic's expansion solidify their position in the economy.

   Since 2241, New California has been radically growing in size.
   Their growth has allowed the NCR to become the largest known post-War country, with a total population number above ~700,000 (excluding transients and people without citizenship) by 2241 (40 years before the events of
   <i key="00c57aad-7fff-4ed6-aa23-54e373264254">
    Fallout: New Vegas
   </i>
   ).
   The Republic's massive population has meant a diverse range of commerce and the development of sprawling urban centers.
   The NCR's sheer number of citizens gives its armed forces a large pool of manpower the NCR Army can conscript at any time. When properly armed and led, the army is capable of defeating even the

    Brotherhood of Steel
   </a>
   without suffering total Pyrrhic victories.
   The principal reason is that the NCR can defeat any force through attrition: Withering enemy numbers through ranged fire while giving ground as necessary. This was the favored tactic of
   Chief Hanlon
   when fighting the Legion in the
   First Battle of Hoover Dam
   , allowing it to secure victory through tactical use of the surrounding terrain.
   However,
   General Lee Oliver
   - wanting a decisive victory over the Legion - planned to use the NCR's military might to amass troops at Hoover Dam to overwhelm and outfight
   Caesar's Legion
   during the
   Second Battle of Hoover Dam
   , and further hoping to rout, pursue and destroy any remaining Legion forces.
  </p>
  <p key="862282ee-6eff-40a0-8839-d1c511f6a767">
   The NCR's size has likely been a strong influencing factor in the expansionist politics of its political and military leaders. The manpower at the disposal of President Kimball has him sending Rangers into parts of
   Baja
   while also contesting Hoover Dam against Caesar's Legion. The NCR's massive population also acts as a deterrent: The Brotherhood of Steel and the
   Van Graffs
   are hesitant to retaliate against the NCR because of the sheer size of their armed forces.
  </p>
  <p key="20f16c70-e8bc-4904-9b7a-f310f8d73ee6">
   While the NCR's huge population is an immense advantage, it has its drawbacks. The population growth in New California has strained the Republic's agricultural capacity and without acquiring new territories and sources of food, the NCR would potentially suffer food shortages by
   2291
   , and eventually famine.
   The
   Office of Science and Industry
   has started research projects to address the matter and improve agricultural capacity, including computerized farm management and salvage operations to find any Old World research to address its food problems.
   The government has also enacted the
   Thaler Act
   to incentivize farmers to move east and work farms to increase agricultural output.
   Many migrate eastwards regardless, as the common perception is that opportunities for success in the NCR have dried up: Unless you're willing to perform wage labor in the Republic's numerous farms, ranches, factories or mills or become a brahmin baron overnight, the only way to strike gold is to make for the frontier.
  </p>
  <p key="e5bcceb9-3e5f-4a6b-bc35-088d7a734274">
   Though seen as necessary from a strategic perspective, expansionism has also led to problems. Key among these is supplying the Republic's armed forces. Units and armaments are shifted according to strategic needs. Areas of relative peace, such as areas around
   New Vegas
   and the
   Mojave Wasteland
   after 2277, are not considered a priority. As such, the occupation is maintained by conscripts and green recruits, armed with surplus weapons and whatever gear the quartermasters issue them. Some recruits may not even receive body armor.

   The executive branch is the Council, headed by the president of the New California Republic and their vice president, elected by the Congress.
   When elected, the president and their cabinet serve a term of 5 years before elections are to be held again. Effectively, a president can serve for life as there are no term limits to the presidency as there was with the United States.

  <p key="ad15465d-85e2-42dd-b541-09c14caf13f5">
   The Congress, also known as the Senate, forms the legislative branch and is staffed by representatives
   elected in popular elections by citizens of each state that the Republic is comprised of. Apart from legislation, Congress also acts as an advisory body to the government of the Republic.
   While the general term for representatives is "congressman," the states themselves use a variety of titles: "councilor," "counselor," "councilman," "representative" and "senator." The Hub refers to their representatives as "governors." The terms are used interchangeably and used widely outside the chambers of the Council and Congress, but within them, they can be used as insults and spark furious debates.

   As mentioned above, NCR citizens have the right to vote for their representatives to sit in Congress. Both citizens and non-citizens enjoy the protection of NCR's
   courts
   (although courts tend to favor citizens in disputes).
   Freedom of religion is considered a right within the NCR, as long as the religion is not violent or psychotic. At the same time, it enforces a strict separation of church and state thanks to Tandi's policies.
   Equality legislation is a prohibition of discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, sexuality or aforementioned religious beliefs. Mutants are also protected since 2205, but enforcing this part of the law has been spotty.

   Immigration into the NCR is open to both humans and mutants, provided they are law-abiding and peaceful. The process is simple. The person in question moves to an NCR territory, presents their claim for immigration, undergoes citizenship training and once their application is processed, is granted the status of a provisional citizen (PC). Full citizenship is granted shortly afterward.
   All registered citizens are required to pay any appropriate and associated taxes.

  <p key="5eaef8fe-937f-4fdf-a38b-9d77c5942611">
   Territories can petition the Republic for annexation. Once the petition is accepted, the NCR grants the town territorial status and establishes the police and army presence in the location to establish the rule of law and eliminate law-breakers. Once this process is completed, the territory can apply for full statehood.
   Between 2241 and 2281, no new territory has been granted full statehood. The frontier New Vegas is the closest to becoming the sixth state of the union.

   The Republic dedicates itself to bringing peace, security and justice to the people within and without their borders. When the NCR can excise rule of law on criminals, it is done so according to the severity of their crimes, with the death penalty being reserved for serious offenses. Murder does not automatically translate to a capital sentence.
   Punishment for criminals inside NCR proper means serving prison time at any number of correctional facilities
   and performing manual labor for the NCR's work-release program.
   However, outside the NCR's territory and entering into the
   Mojave Wasteland
   is a different story. The NCR Army isn't keen on peacekeeping activities and usually swiftly punishes crimes committed in and around
   New Vegas
   with death.

   Part of this includes the setting of bounties and delegating the responsibility of capture to able civilians that can bring in criminals that have eluded NCR lawmen or military.
   At least for the military, bounties require proof in the form of an intact head; anything less conclusive results in a fraction of the bounty being rewarded.

   This same rule of law also applies to prisoners of war. With laws enacted during President Tandi's administration, the NCR recognizes the rights of prisoners of war and approaches their care humanely and free from abuse. Most officers find these laws to be constricting,

   In theory, this is a sound and well-balanced system, but in practice, every state tries to assert its independence and work towards furthering its own agenda. There is much friction between the states of Hub and Shady Sands, usually related to trade rights and caravan routes. Significant pressure is exerted on the political and economic direction of the NCR by a variety of private interests; in particular, the brahmin barons whose wealth gives them great influence at the ballot box and whose needs are often placed first by officials seeking support in their political ambitions. With the armed forces, the
   Gun Runners
   gain special dispensation and influence as they are the primary contributor to NCR's weapon arsenal.
   Elsewhere, monopolies like the
   Crimson Caravan
   and similar trading families dominate the trade routes and use their wealth to gain influence with the NCR government and extort large amounts of money. Smaller competitors who are unable to compete with both the larger competition as well as the high taxes are inevitably muscled out.

   the NCR has grown substantially, focusing efforts on rebuilding the pre-War infrastructure and restarting technological development, while under Aaron Kimball, the NCR became more imperialistic and expansive, overextending itself in the process thanks in no small part to General Oliver's incompetence and bureaucratic red tape.

   Subordinated to the president and the Congress, the military of the Republic is one of its most distinguishing elements. The core component, the
   NCR Army
   , has thousands of
   servicemen
   , either volunteers or draftees, organized into divisions and battalions, equipped with standardized weapons and armor, and with varying degrees of training and competence.
   They are the proverbial sledgehammer, a tool used to crush enemies of the Republic and build order in the lands under its control, and a shield, protecting it from harm that may come from its numerous enemies, such as the

   . They have grown into one of the most professional and deadly military outfits in the wastes and were folded under the military command of the army. Commonly respected for their valor and skill in battle, the rangers are folk heroes and enjoy an unblemished, heroic reputation and access to top of the line weapons and armor, often coming from recovered and restored pre-War goods.

   The Republic practices what it preaches and the military, like society, makes no distinction between the genders when it comes to serving in the military.
   Super mutants

   In addition, military honors are awarded for valor, such as the

   Many people in the western wastelands have mixed feelings about the NCR. Some people strongly support the Republic's goals of spreading democracy and the rule of law, and others vehemently oppose their methods of "controlling" everything they come into contact with. With wastelanders who were used to having no more than a mayor or sheriff now suddenly being part of a complex political structure and having to pay taxes,
   some view it as a loss of the frontier lifestyles that once defined them. As the NCR's power and territory grew, it made progressively stronger enemies who would test the resolve of the Republic.
  </p>
  <p key="ad5a942a-c61d-4ee9-a138-6c038e179e8a">
   Under President Tandi, the NCR made slow but sustainable territorial expansion, allowing towns and other small communities, who were impressed by the principles of the NCR, to join of their own volition while defending their borders from hostile raiders like the once legendary
   Vipers
   and
   Jackals
   , who would be ravaged by the NCR's military until they became broken shadows of their former glory. Eventually taming southern California, these achievements would garner such respect for President Tandi that the people would come to adore her, and
   tribals
   outside the NCR's borders would refer to her as the "Great Mother."
  </p>
  <p key="7407e663-f0d3-48c1-90e7-6bd74e506056">
   Viewing the NCR's growth and success as a threat to their already stagnating power and influence, the Brotherhood of Steel would launch a
   military campaign
   with the goal of pacifying the NCR and asserting its dominance over the wasteland and its technology. The NCR would ultimately prevail and force the Brotherhood into retreat and hiding. The NCR had defeated their strongest opponent yet.
  </p>
  <p key="f1666387-7702-4992-b303-34acf2773d53">
   After the death of President Tandi, her successors would gradually change the direction of the NCR. Rapidly expanding the Republic's borders in every direction in a more imperialistic fashion, they sacrificed some of the NCR's principles and moral high ground in the process. Tribals that once revered the "Great Mother" began to become "domesticated" as the nation sweeps through tribal lands.
   Under President Aaron Kimball, the NCR's expansion has led it to the
   Mojave Wasteland
   , where it would encounter the impressive city of
   New Vegas
   , and the even more promising
   Hoover Dam
   . However, it would also encounter its greatest enemy to date,
   Caesar's Legion
   , across the
   Colorado River
   .
  </p>
  <p key="a1d351ae-06a5-4f54-8653-4ae823e3c5d2">
   The NCR initially had great success in the Mojave Wasteland, setting up bases and an embassy on
   The Strip
   . The front line of the new conflict between the NCR and Caesar's Legion moved towards the Colorado River. The Legion attacked the NCR with its full strength during the
   First Battle of Hoover Dam
   . The NCR successfully repulsed the Legion's assault on Hoover Dam, devastating the Legion's elite forces by luring them into a trap at
   Boulder City
   in the process. After their defeat, the Legion regularly conducted raids on the west side of the Colorado River, even creating permanent bases at
   Cottonwood Cove
   and sacking towns like
   Nipton
   and
   Nelson
   with little response from the NCR. Known wars and military conflicts in which the NCR was involved include those with the
   Enclave
   ,
   Brotherhood
   ,
   Great Khans
   ,
   Legion
   and the
   Raiders

   Overall, the Republic can be readily described as the most advanced entity in post-nuclear North America. While smaller organizations do possess more advanced weapons, armor or tools (like the
   <a href="Enclave.html" key="079b2d45-357f-498f-be4e-4a9cfb4956bf" title="Enclave">

   Free Economic Zone of New Vegas

   . The keystones of the Republic's economic might are its brahmin herds and arable land painstakingly recultivated with primitive tools they had at their disposal. Aided strongly by the
   <a href="Followers of the Apocalypse.html" key="4e2aa0c5-ab89-4cba-819f-bb7d364fe21a" title="Followers of the Apocalypse">
    Followers of the Apocalypse
   </a>
   , the Republic thrived. When the shift in foreign policy occurred with Kimball's election, the relations soured and the Republic eventually lost the Followers' support. However, disillusioned Followers flocked to the government and formed the
   Office of Science and Industry
   in
   2275
   , becoming a dedicated, NCR-aligned research and development house. By
   2281
   , their achievements include implementing computer simulations to aid with agricultural planning and cultivation,
   maximizing the output of
   Hoover Dam
   and restoring the power grid between the Mojave and

   However, the technology is not limited to just agriculture. The Hoover Dam powers every city and major settlement in

   ,
   while the
   OSI
   continues to (re)develop and implement new technologies in fields such as medicine, engineering and biology.
   Building on the strong infrastructure built during the 52 years of President Tandi's rule, which includes roads, railways, transportation, manufacturing, forts and more, the OSI increased the NCR's technological advantage over its competitors.
   That edge is nothing if not immense: By
   2281
   , the Republic's powerful merchant companies have access to facilities and materials allowing them to manufacture standardized armaments, weapons and ammunition to fully outfit the largest standing army in the wasteland, to the point of different companies actively competing with each other for supply contracts (such as the
   Crimson Caravan
   and
   Far Go Traders
   )
   or even considered an unofficial branch of the Army (the
   Gun Runners
   ).

   Advanced technologies are also harnessed by the Republic for the benefit of its citizens. The annexation of
   Vault City
   granted the Republic access to advanced medical and scientific technologies, including organ
   cloning
   ,
   performance-enhancing implants, armor grafts
   and other refined procedures.
   Other advanced technologies utilized by the Republic include satellite communications,
   power armor taken from

   and even global positioning system satellites.
   The NCR also has the ability to construct concrete bunkers on vital frontlines, such as the
   Colorado River
   .
  </p>
  <p key="05c86475-1d05-469c-b841-3ac2e47f9ec7">
   Infrastructure is also a prominent success of the NCR's technology, as the Republic is known to have used railroads
   and uses refurbished
   Vertibirds
   salvaged from its
   war with the Enclave
   . One example of this is
   Bear Force One
   , the vehicle that Aaron Kimball arrives in to make his speech at the Hoover Dam in 2281.
