   FEV is a megavirus, with a protein sheath reinforced by ionized hydrogen. It is capable of absorbing neutrons without becoming radioactive (i.e., it cannot be sterilized by
   <a href="Radiation.html" key="8c0e1972-3b1d-4a97-b385-b75f605d26a8" title="Radiation">
    radiation
   </a>
   ). In terms of functionality, FEV is a shifting-absorptive virus, copying DNA patterns and storing these patterns in exons much like a retrovirus. These exons, combined with the FEV, are re-injected into the host cells in typical viral infectious fashion. This causes the host cells to "regenerate" their DNA with FEV's corrections that eradicated recessive genes.
  </p>
  <p key="21bb3f9c-c395-4e15-91b7-f2a671cf10af">
   FEV comes pre-loaded with introns of corrected DNA that eradicate recessive genes responsible for ailments and alters RNA strands for greater transmission of signals.
   DNA altered by the virus renders the subject immune to biochemical weapons, radiation, and common diseases. Cellular division rate is increased, with mitosis occurring at 115% of the normal human rate. Normally non-regenerating tissue, such as neural tissue and non-somatic cells, also begin to replicate, allowing for real-time regeneration.
  </p>
  <p key="314b06fe-e2c0-4233-8add-d950460abdc4">
   FEV is also highly corrosive and volatile in its pure form, capable of degrading rubber containment seals like acid, though without any acidic residue.
   This also rendered attempts at creating an effective decontamination process difficult, as FEV could render most compounds inert before they could neutralize the virus. Eventually, combining a booster with an antiviral compound created a neutralizing agent capable of rendering FEV inert when applied in sufficient quantities.

  <p key="7638459b-1faa-4646-ad2d-71916e347dc3">
   One feature of FEV is that it partially relies upon the DNA of the individual coming in contact with it. Coupled with portions of its own recursive code, effects of exposure can be unpredictable,
   particularly when non-humans are exposed to the virus, or multiple organisms are placed into the same vat (
   <i key="bbd1af8e-a201-4927-930b-3e5f389dd13b">
    vide
   </i>
   centaurs
   ).
   This feature of FEV made it incredibly versatile, though tweaking the genome of the virus required extensive experimentation: Strains would typically produce unstable results, with few viable, stable strains.
  </p>
  <p key="72a0f0b2-1a54-4eb9-aae9-19aa82f93fee">
   Changes to DNA are expressed phenotypically by recursive growth patterns integrated into the FEV. However, apart from the genome in the virus strain, effects also vary greatly depending on the method of exposure. Prolonged immersion in the virus creates the most stunning transformations, such as super mutants and centaurs. In

   this has been achieved by a 24 hour exposure to FEV-II in the vats, achieving a severe overdose of the virus.

    Vault 87
   </a>
   , infection took place in sealed chambers, where an aerosolized virus was introduced. The exposure was relatively brief, compared to the Mariposa procedure.
   In Appalachia and the
   Institute
   , exposure to their own version of the virus took place in sealed tubes, where the subject was immersed for a prolonged period of time, allowing for observation of the transformation results.
  </p>
  <p key="e062c704-14bf-4c02-8a5a-74db903990d9">
   On the other hand, injections of small doses of the virus will not bring about transformation but can be used to induce a variety of changes. The Master used localized FEV injections to modify himself in the early days of the Unity, and later experimented with brain injections,
   awakening the latent
   psyker
   potential in the subjects (though also causing permanent, terminal insanity). The Enclave used a modified FEV virus to greatly increase the intelligence of deathclaws through cranial injections (overshooting the project's goals by a wide margin).

  </h3>
  <p key="8e3b8467-c247-4ca8-be92-dd49ca5401bf">
   Since FEV does not store an unaltered copy of the subject's DNA, the changes are generally impossible to revert. Theoretically, the mutation process could be reversed by infecting the subject with a secondary virus that contained a copy of the subject's original DNA and replaced the FEV's modified strands, then forced recursive growth again. However, it would also be necessary to neutralize FEV itself to prevent mutation from reoccurring. It was not possible with pre-War technology.
  </p>
  <p key="be2c65f6-1b39-4fde-a07c-8966dd3a87ba">
   However, the Institute's FEV research made this possible.
   Dr. Brian Virgil
   created a serum to revert the mutation. Like the FEV itself, the serum was a retrovirus,
   using recombinant counter-intron sequences and transcriptive exon strands
   together with a genetic resequencer to counteract the specific strain of FEV that Virgil was infected with. Technically, the serum did not actually revert his mutation: It restored him to a human state by
   <i key="5b1ee464-aa5e-4142-9f8b-9cc78771217b">
    recreating
   </i>
   it using the mutated DNA as a basis. The experimental state of the serum and a buggy resequencer prevent a perfect restoration, leaving portions of the mutated code untouched. If exposed, Virgil will retain some muscle mass after the transformation and will not suffer from baldness. As the cure was also tailored to the specific strain Virgil infected himself with, generalizing the formula would take years, if not decades of additional, intense research.

   Initial experiments into FEV were for the purpose of a biological weapon. The virulent toxin that would eventually become FEV-II saw extensive research until its much more potent quality of completely altering and mutating the human body was discovered. Research quickly swerved into heading up possibilities of a cure for New Plague and creating "super-soldiers," as well as its other applications with mutating life with the toxin.
   The research that was done into the biological weapon applications were filed away deep within the record vaults of

   A super mutant autopsied by

   was 3.2 meters tall (10'7") and weighed 363.21 kg (~801 lbs). The subject's muscle mass accounted for 77.41% , bone mass measured 10.23%, tissue was 9.34%, and fat mass was 3.02%.
   The increased muscle and body mass lead to a change in posture: FEV super mutants have a characteristic, hunched posture. The skin tone changes substantially and becomes gray with tints of light green, though as the mutant ages, it may become more green or even olive. The skin becomes much thicker and resistant to trauma, including cuts, bruises and damage from fire, acid or even gunfire.
   Despite this resistance to trauma, completely destroyed tissues cannot regenerate and will result in permanent scarring or organ loss.

   Increased size of neural transmitters and synaptic receivers in the body give super mutants acute reflexes and heightened senses.
   These changes are usually not accompanied by a similar rise in intellect. The FEV strain in Mariposa has a chance of modifying intelligence: while most people retain their pre-dipping intellect,
   a majority of the remaining group experiences a loss (typically by 30%),
   while the remaining minority of exceptional individuals may even experience an increase.
   The loss is the result of damage caused by recursive growth and increase in brain mass, which may be accompanied by disfigurement and damage to existing neural patterns, causing loss of memory.

   Vree would also theorize that super mutants are immune to common diseases and radiation and that the mutation approximate increased life expectancy by 10%.
   Vree was correct about common diseases and radiation,

   retains the recursive growth patterns characteristic to FEV, but has a different effect, which may also be linked to how infection was performed in the labs. Testing began in
   2078
   ,
   where test subjects were exposed a single time to FEV in isolated chambers where the virus was deployed with an airborne aerosol. Phenotypical changes occur within three days and include increased muscle mass, changes in skeletal structure, and atrophy of sexual characteristics, both primary and secondary (including body hair). At ten days, skin pigmentation becomes a mixture of yellow and green, while its thickness and resistance to radiation and other environmental hazards rapidly increases.
  </p>
  <p key="320cdbcf-f29e-45c3-b037-deb107a29e41">
   However, a key problem was that the mutation did not stop. Within fourteen days of initial exposure, test subjects regress to an almost feral state, exhibiting extreme aggression at every non-mutant. While some semblance of cognition is retained, exhibited by the ability to speak, operate machines and use basic tactics in combat, super mutants of this type are typically characterized by significant mental degradation.
   This result is most likely brought upon by the same factor as with FEV-II: Damage to existing neural patterns caused by rapid changes in the phenotype. The effects typically cause significant damage to long term memory, again, a shared characteristic.
   The traumatic nature of the transformation is also a factor. The excruciating pain that accompanies it can and will cause the subjects to become insane.
  </p>
  <p key="fb184fc7-a6e0-48b9-96f1-01c82502d2fd">
   Another unforeseen side effect is that the unfinished virus strain codes the body for continued growth. If a super mutant of this type eludes death for prolonged periods of time, they may become a considerable threat, reaching the size of a small building.

An error in the synthesis process created a virus that left the ants' size unaltered but altered their venom sacks to produce a flammable liquid that they can aerosolize, project, and ignite with a spark generated by clicking mandibles. The resulting pyrosis, as he calls it, turns them effectively into walking flamethrowers.

   The history of the FEV starts with Pan-Immunity Virion batch 10-011, renamed as the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV) and used in further research. The key difference was that instead of Pan-Immunity Virion's quad-helix DNA structure, the batch became a shifting-absorptive virus. This was a deliberate choice by
   Major Barnett
   , who considered the unwanted side effects of the quad-helix structure to outweigh the benefits of replicative stability afforded by the design.

   The first experiments took place in
   March 21, 2075
   on single-celled organisms. While their base metabolism appeared unchanged, their immunity to infection and radiation exceeded all earlier expectations. Research on FEV effects on plants proved unsuccessful. The next stage included flatworms. Infected on May 9, 2075, they exhibited a 28% increase in size and resistance to 9 separate viral contagions within hours. The new DNA structure was successfully passed to progeny, though only asexual reproduction was possible.

Within hours they exhibited increased growth, stabilizing at a 31% size increase after nine days. The most increase in size occurred in striated muscle tissue and certain internal organs, including the liver, heart, and kidneys. An increase in intelligence was also noted, allowing mice to run mazes in less than half the time required by normal mice.

  <p key="fe9a12be-fcc7-470d-bba9-c0ad79d309d3">
   The final experimentation with FEV batch 10-011 occurred with rabbits. On November 9, 2075, 218 rabbits were infected, half of which were implanted with electrodes to monitor changes in EEG activity. Increased electrical activity was noted 3.2 seconds after infection, accompanied by the typical increase in size. A new effect was noted, namely an increase in aggression and posturing, particularly among males. Dissection of the brains showed an increased dendritic connection, particularly in the limbic system and frontal cortex (areas responsible for behavior, senses and higher mental functions).

As part of the test, 53 raccoons were infected with the new strain on January 26, 2076.

   The Appalachian branch continued its experimentation by pushing FEV to its practical limits and experimenting with recombinant strains. The experimental strains resulted in the creation of many unsustainable forms: FEVS-005938 tested on January 13, 2077, rendered the subject unable to breathe,
   FEVS-006186 from April 30 converted the subject into a mass of retinal tissue,
   FEVS-006309 from July 12 produced canines that pierced the brain stem through unrestrained growth,

Harold woke up in the wastes outside the base, mutating due to exposure to FEV fumes, but becoming a special type of a ghoul-like mutant, rather than a super mutant. Grey, on the other hand, underwent extreme mutation due to prolonged exposure to the virus in the vat. His intellect grew exponentially, allowing him to comprehend even the most complex issues easily (or so he thought).
   Grey methodically researched FEV, experimenting with animals and eventually, captured scavengers that strayed into the facility. It was not until a few failed mutations that he discovered radiation count to be a deciding factor in the success of the change, leading him to pick subjects more carefully.

   Such exposure was not enough to cause phenotypical changes, but enough to cause conflicts when the pure FEV in Mariposa attempted to change the DNA, resulting in the death of the subject.

   The impact of the Great Winter of

   's research into FEV,
   which has continued since the early 2220s in a dedicated facility. The original goal was the creation of a successor to second generation
   synths
   by creating a new breed of super mutant that would serve the Institute as laborer and soldier. Due to a lack of success with mutants, efforts were refocused with the goal of creating third-generation synths. The organic synth project was spun off from the FEV research initiative around 2227 (the acquisition of

   ), while the FEV research effort continued for several more decades.
   Both women and men were abducted from the Commonwealth and submerged in the Institute's modified FEV, their mutations carefully tracked. Successful mutations would be monitored to ensured survivability, then tagged and discarded.
   In layman's terms, the Institute was simply releasing super mutants into the wild, creating a scourge on the Commonwealth that lasted for years.
   When
   Brian Virgil
   succeeded Dr.
   Syverson
   as head of the project in April 2286, it became evident that FEV experimentation ran its course and served no useful purpose, not with the availability of third generation
   synths
   .
   Eventually, as Virgil's conscience took its toll, the scientist lodged a formal complaint with the Directorate.
   When no reaction came, Virgil rebelled and escaped the Institute after transforming himself into a super mutant, destroying as much of the project as he could.
