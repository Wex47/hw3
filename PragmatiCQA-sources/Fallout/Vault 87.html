   Construction on Vault 87 began in May 2066 and finished in December 2071. The primary computer system was Cyberbrain v2.3, while energy was provided by a
   General Atomics
   nuclear reactor, with a backup
   Versicorps
   fusion power generator. Non-standard equipment included four stasis chambers, a plasma containment field, six food processing stations and a
   Garden of Eden Creation Kit
   .
  </p>
  <p key="f195d8fd-892c-41cc-8f10-8e03a47fa48e">
   Around 2076, the original Vault experiment was scrapped and the Vault was converted into a secondary research center that would study the effects of the
   <a href="Forced Evolutionary Virus.html" key="f21d2617-0ceb-47e5-8d9c-a339bc8df992" title="Forced Evolutionary Virus">
    Forced Evolutionary Virus
   </a>
   on humans, exclusively for
   Dr. Wayne Merrick
   and his staff. Using batch 11-111 as a basis
   , the team attempted to create a virus batch that would result in reliable creation of humans adapted to the post-nuclear environment, the
   Evolutionary Experimentation Program
   . However, despite the efforts of the science team, only
   inferior mutants
   were created. Despite a substantial increase in size, strength and practical immunity to environmental hazards, the subjects suffered from considerable mental damage and extreme aggression towards their surroundings.
  </p>
  <p key="a1376f44-cdd7-4a28-a4f9-6af5ce17bae0">
   The
   overseer
   and his security guards were well aware of the nature of the experimentation,
   as they were following their orders from Vault-Tec.
   However, the standard security measures were not enough. A year after the Vault was sealed (following a disastrous nuclear detonation right on top of the entry cave), some test subjects broke free, overwhelming the security forces and beginning a haphazard dipping process.
  </p>
  <p key="6498cfab-529d-4da3-95e8-a402f1ed5e53">
   Since then, the mutants are effectively a staple of the Capital Wasteland. They are obsessed with the preservation of their species as they are all irrevocably sterile. Super mutants kidnap humans from all over the Capital Wasteland and bring them to the Vault to be mutated. They have been doing so for nearly 200 years until their source of FEV started to run out. Because of the shortage of the "green stuff," there are now super mutant bands searching all over the Capital Wasteland for a new source of the virus.
  </p>
  <p key="8b09681e-3edb-4396-8a65-95b105b60578">
   By 2277, the Vault is in a state of disrepair. Lack of maintenance led to advanced deterioration of subsystems and even the very structure of the Vault. Parts of it have collapsed entirely. The mutants, owing to their low intelligence, have adapted various sections of the bunker in an ad hoc fashion. For example, medical recovery rooms were turned into makeshift prison cells meant to store experiments deemed a failure (like
   Fawkes
   ).

   It is possible to reach the entrance through the extensive use of
   RadAway
   in combination with clothing providing
   radiation
   resistance and Rad-X. However, as the overseer's message states, the door is inaccessible, making the Vault impossible to enter from aboveground. The map marker will activate near the entrance. There is a
   dead scientist
   in a
   radiation suit
   that can be found near the Vault door, as well as RadAway and
   Rad-X
   , presumably carried by the scientist, but apparently not enough to prevent her death by massive radiation exposure.

  <p key="17c9080f-133e-4222-895c-76959fef1cca">
   The entrance can also be found from within. The test labs section of the Vault has a key-locked door near where the Lone Wanderer is captured and taken to Raven Rock at the end of the quest. Going in there will reveal the Vault door, though nothing is behind it.

   Super mutants
   have built a barricade of broken girders and wrecked cars around the entrance. If one decides to venture into this one-way deathtrap, they have to defeat them before going in, remembering that super mutants can be exposed to intense radiation without ill effects, like the possible companion
   Fawkes
   . One can fast travel from the Vault's entrance despite the heavy radiation which normally prevents fast-travel; though, almost always, one will arrive dead. An
   Enclave eyebot
   usually patrols south of the entrance.

   Vault 87 is very similar to all the other Vaults a player may visit during the game, with narrow corridors and small rooms connected by the main lobby. Once inside the dimly lit Vault, the Lone Wanderer will encounter various super mutants and centaurs. The Lone Wanderer can also find the remains of failed FEV subjects in addition to the mutilated bodies of victims and
   gore bags
   .
  </p>
  <p key="b7358c65-2827-47a9-bfab-220abba99afe">
   Eventually, the Lone Wanderer will encounter a friendly super mutant named Fawkes, who was sealed in a test chamber and left there decades before. Fawkes, via the intercom, will offer his services in acquiring the G.E.C.K. in return for being freed from his cell. Though Fawkes does not have to be freed, the super mutant will indeed honor this bargain and help the Lone Wanderer acquire the G.E.C.K. by serving as a guide, as well as attacking any future enemies encountered, and finally, retrieving the device itself from its highly irradiated resting place. However, the same goes for the door and there are three options for interaction. One of these choices has the player activate the G.E.C.K., killing the player. Later, if the player character has good
   Karma
   , Fawkes can be recruited as a follower, after
   The American Dream
   .
  </p>
  <p key="a79c8b6c-b94d-4f1b-8d1c-b1b93361ece4">
   There are two methods to free Fawkes. First, in the room at the end of the right hallway, a fire can set off the fire alarm in a room inhabited by two super mutant variants, which will open all five isolation rooms. However, in the process, two centaurs and a hostile non-player character will also be freed. Hacking the Average-locked terminal located next to the fire alarm will make it so the player can unlock an individual chamber, of which Fawkes' cell is the fifth.

    On the way from Fawkes' isolation room to the G.E.C.K. storage room, there is a door that says "Requires Key." If one returns to the Vault after escaping the Enclave, it is left open (does not apply for Game of the Year version). Walking through this door leads to an empty room containing the closed main Vault door for Vault 87, complete with an "87" logo on the outside. The door can be "used," and it will be opened/closed via a mechanical arm (just like in other Vaults with working doors); however, there is nothing on the other side except for a small platform that opens into empty space. Walking off the edge of the platform into the empty space will redeposit the player character in front of Fawkes' isolation room.

    Sometimes after the player character retrieves the G.E.C.K., a super mutant will follow them into the room where the Enclave ambushes the player character. Once the player character falls to the floor, the Enclave and super mutants will not attack one another, and since the player character is hidden from the super mutants, they cannot be attacked nor escorted to Raven Rock, but will be stuck on the floor.
