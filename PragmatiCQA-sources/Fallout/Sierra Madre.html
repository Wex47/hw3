   The

   </i>
   " During its construction until the end, it remained a reclusive area. All conveniences were supplied to the inhabitants by
   unique vending machines
   , which provided a number of commercial and non-commercial services, and allowed the residents to live in self-sufficiency, even when cut off from the outside world. The goal of the entire enterprise was not only to create a great casino - it was to create the perfect shelter from the nuclear holocaust. Every element of Sierra Madre's functions is designed to protect its inhabitants.
  </p>
  <p key="6b0f34b5-73d0-4d0b-b78f-7839d5b0e2a3">
   In design, Sinclair was drawn to the nostalgic Art Deco era. This is reflected in the architecture of the villa and of the casino. To make it a perfect
   opening gala
   , Sinclair strengthened its
   frequency emissions
   , normally reserved for emergency broadcast signals before the war. The kitchens of the Sierra Madre aimed for a 5-star rating, and sought to bring in the best chefs from around the world. In order to meet deadlines and budgets, the construction of the Sierra Madre was handled by two different companies: a well-performing company for the casino, and a cheaper, slacking, corrupt company for the Villa, resulting in numerous incidents during the construction of the Villa.
  </p>
  <p key="08e0a7ff-4d79-492e-8b37-18425f162bd0">
   As guardian of his paradise, Sinclair forbade any other food or vending machines beyond the ones he'd installed there, and banned any personal contraband like chems, alcohol, and "foreign substances", which created a black market from the workers within. Part of Sierra Madre's security's role was to prevent such contraband from entering the Villa area. They were known to have conducted inspections of the
   Puesta del Sol
   construction offices, confiscating prohibited items.
  </p>
  <p key="00b6af40-3e03-479e-9438-9f9605bdf60b">
   Obsessed with security, likely due to his own financial losses in the 2070s, Sinclair installed
   holograms
   , a futuristic technology purchased on an exclusive contract by Sinclair. The doors of the Sierra Madre were designed to hermetically seal in case of emergency, and the speakers were shielded to prevent vandalism. The Sierra Madre Casino &amp; Resort was equipped with an automated front desk that would escort guests to their rooms upon arrival, and security systems that would stun those entering with foreign substances or contaminated by radiation.
  </p>
  <p key="b0ba575d-7a45-43ac-84c2-91d4ed95c202">
   There is also a darker side to the Madre. In return for the technologies supplied by
   Big MT
   , Sinclair agreed to have the casino and the villa act as proving grounds for various experimental technologies such as the
   saturnite
   alloy,
   hazmat suits
   , and
   prototype matter recombinators
   . Sinclair was oblivious to the fact that previous similar deals did not end well (as was the case with
   Hopeville
   and its disastrous meteorological research project). In the Sierra Madre, the catch came in the form of the
   Cloud
   , a strange toxin created in the
   laboratories
   of
   Big MT
   .

   The Sierra Madre Villa was the private city of the guests, employees, and workers of
   Frederick Sinclair
   , situated just before the casino. The streets were built so that cars can not circulate, preventing pollution and noise nuisance.
  </p>
  <p key="a8c95d7c-7708-44f5-a5c9-22d89b467f08">
   In addition to the main area, the Villa was composed of four districts:
  </p>

   </li>
   <li key="91a52dfe-9cde-4586-9cb6-bba4227013c2">
    Residential District

  </ul>
  <p key="ea8fc1fe-8287-4d9c-ae09-d91af1510418">
   To avoid having to spend too much money for the construction of the villa at the expense of the casino, it was poorly constructed. The material used for the Villa's construction was described as "sand barely held together with spit and glue." Buildings and structures in the Villa were completely unstable and could collapse overnight. All of this caused construction crews to suffer numerous setbacks and accidents. To prevent the employees of the Sierra Madre from discovering these facts, senior persons destroyed all medical reports, and were also protected legally. In addition, shipping problems plagued the Villa. Construction explosives, countless crates of steak knives, and more were shipped to the Villa, paid for, and left.

   nearing,
   Frederick Sinclair
   , the chief architect and financier of this grand fortress, wished to save
   Vera Keyes
   , his love, from the looming destruction. To this end, the
   Sierra Madre Villa
   and its capstone casino were built. But that was not enough for Sinclair: deep within the basement of the casino, a nearly impenetrable
   vault
   was constructed as well, to make sure he and his love could ride out the apocalypse, together.
  </p>
  <p key="0ac49b28-0a21-4193-8928-4023c8f31d83">
   Security was of the utmost importance and N.E. was contracted to provide it. Anything foreign or unauthorized that entered the casino was detected by security measures and instantly rendered comatose and moved to another location within the hotel.
   Further into the casino, an emergency broadcast emitter could be triggered and the myriad of
   holograms
   designed specifically for Sinclair would activate, patrol the
   casino
   and
   executive suites
   , and exercise lethal force on unauthorized visitors to protect the hotel guests under their charge.
   The entire casino was also lined with a metal that interferes with radio reception and broadcasts out of the casino;
   this was put in place to ensure that the radio frequencies from within the casino would not interfere with the hologram beacon in the Villa, which would send out an emergency signal so others would be alerted to Ms. Keyes' presence within the casino.
  </p>
  <p key="7cb2a242-c29f-4e4a-acb4-67f0bc5b44d7">
   After all this preparation, Sinclair failed to anticipate one thing: Vera's complicity with lounge singer
   Dean Domino
   's plot to break Sinclair's heart and steal the treasure of the Sierra Madre for themselves. Domino had enlisted her aid in his planned heist, later blackmailing her with evidence of her
   Med-X
   addiction, completely unaware that she was terminally ill.
   This news broke Sinclair's heart and he became embittered and vengeful, transforming his shelter into a trap, ensuring the elevator down to the vault only went in one direction, and upgrading his security
   holograms
   to make sure that rescue would never come for Vera and Domino.
   After Vera broke down and confessed everything, Sinclair, fearing he had overstepped himself, did what he could to reverse his changes, but he could only do so much and the casino remained a deathtrap. He died in the vault, unable to return to the casino and his love.
  </p>
  <p key="b0abf672-a428-4efa-a86a-e5c1f6c80180">
   The guests would meet a similar fate, while the

   occurred outside, they were slaughtered by the automated security, their last calls for help recorded by the systems. Vera Keyes instead met her fate in her hotel room. Her last words to Sinclair were recorded by the system, her
   holographic form
   and last words living on as ghosts in the
   executive suites
   . She chose to take her own life using the drugs that kept her alive, after writing her final words "Let Go."
  </p>
  <p key="443880a5-e269-4b78-a594-492fbe06ea0c">
   When the second crew arrived in 2281, the casino awoke yet again, its automated security shutting down as its other automatons started back up. Its pre-recorded music and audio files began to play, albeit on now deteriorated equipment. This proved inconvenient, as these unwilling heist members were still wearing
   their explosive collars
   , which interfered with their signal to Elijah.
   Meanwhile, the ghost people gathered at the casino, attempting to get in. After the Courier was able to establish a connection to one of the other floors and access a piece of the music archives (due to their importance, being a workaround to the sound files that were used in the security systems) they find a way in, with more gathering as subsequent floors were reconnected.

   Created as an experiment by the
   Big MT
   execs, the Cloud is a product of the
   Z-43 innovative toxins plant
   located in the crater. When
   Frederick Sinclair
   came to Big MT for technology to purchase for the

   , he unwittingly signed a Faustian pact: Apart from
   holograms
   and
   matter recombinators
   , the Think Tank would also place the Cloud at the Sierra Madre, using the casino, villa and its inhabitants as guinea pigs in its experiments.
   Sinclair likely saw no other way to get the technology he needed, as he was already teetering on the brink of bankruptcy when he started negotiating with the executives. Of course, he was not informed that he would be receiving more than just harmless prototypes.
   The Sierra Madre was the only testing ground that was protected by the Cloud, which was hardly a prize.
  </p>
  <p key="a2680f52-ee7b-43ff-9b98-546d4710bc18">
   The Cloud manifested itself for the first time when the cheap villa ventilation system ground to a halt, a victim of cutting corners and
   Mr. Yesterday's
   dubious practices. The pipes backed up, spewing out the red cloud. Workers in the area started choking and vomiting. Hospitalized in the
   villa clinic
   , the damage to their health was extensive enough to put them out of commission for good.
  </p>
  <p key="1d38d33a-8d12-41ec-bf62-50c5fe95f1f9">
   To deal with the problem, Sinclair negotiated with the Big MT executives for yet another technology: The Darklight
   hazmat suits
   .
   Although considered creepy by the maintenance crews, they allowed the crews to explore the ventilation system and try, in vain, to identify the source of the Cloud.
  </p>
  <p key="977ba924-46a9-4631-a360-c65578d6db06">
   The teams managed to find the source of the problem in the main ventilation pipe. However, traces of the dust cloud were present and eroded the metal of the suit's locks, exposing them to the Cloud and sealing them within.
   The crewmen retreated and headed to the villa clinic to get medical attention. Much to the displeasure of the attending physicians, they cut themselves out of the suits with steak knives.
  </p>
  <p key="4dc1d652-30fa-4154-a6b9-e6f2f1252380">
   However, despite the problems, the ventilation system was eventually restored to barely functional order. When the Great War hit shortly afterward, it continued to work for a few more years, before finally giving up the ghost. The Cloud gradually seeped into the area, climbing out of the damaged vents, eventually blanketing the area, blotting out the sun.
   It became a grim, uncompromising guardian of its secrets. The maintenance crews who donned their hazmat suits and tried to fight it, succumbed to its effects, mutating and becoming the violent, savage guardians of the Sierra Madre.
  </p>
  <p key="2186c42b-6ad9-47ba-b63c-d73f950540c4">
   For centuries, the Cloud protected the casino and the villa, killing scavengers or weakening them so that they would become another victim of the tribe inhabiting it, the hazmat suited
   ghost people
   . It wasn't until the 23rd century that it became important once more.

   elder
   , learned of its existence from
   Ulysses
   . It inspired him.
   When preliminary samples taken from air on the edges of the Sierra Madre yielded promising results, he set up a chemistry set to allow it to replenish itself and traveled to the Madre in person, to perform research onsite.
  </p>
  <p key="a6f479ae-da4a-4ba4-ab07-939f44d7ab55">
   Upon further research, Elijah decided to weaponize the Cloud as a weapon of mass destruction, to wipe the slate clean. It was intended to be used to reclaim the Mojave and destroy the
   New California Republic
   He also plans to use it as an offensive technology, unleashing it upon the Mojave, cutting it off from the rest of the world. He could then use modified
   REPCONN
   rockets to push out both the New California Republic and
   Caesar's Legion
   at
   Hoover Dam
   , and finally, let traces of it drift west to NCR territory.

    The level has many connections to Abbot Kinney, the designer of Venice, California. Kinney suffered from tuberculosis (attributed to a miasma through much of human history) and constructed a sanitarium, the Sierra Madre Villa Hotel in the San Gabriel Timberland Reserve. It was common for sufferers of tuberculosis to seek treatment in dry climates at the time. Additionally, Kinney's ghost is said to haunt Venice.
