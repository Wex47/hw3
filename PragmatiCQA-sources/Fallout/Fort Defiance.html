   Fort Defiance was built in the 1800s to provide treatment for the region's mentally ill.
   Despite careful planning, the building, originally designed for 300 patients, had occupant numbers upwards of 3,000 by
   2061
   . The resulting horrible conditions in the hospital were amplified by neglect on part of the personnel and caused undue suffering for the patients.
  </p>
  <p key="10c348e9-b215-4bef-8281-716a81560c0a">
   Conditions within the asylum were abysmal for patients, though staff also suffered. Relations between staff and patients were poor, with staff referring to the patients by number rather than name. In one notable incident, a junior nurse suffered a nervous breakdown from exhaustion and was removed from his position to recuperate. In another incident, a patient bit a nurse, tearing her hand open, and attempted to flee.
  </p>
  <p key="596da0e3-7a51-4faf-bd82-ea698f06fb73">
   The truth of the conditions at the asylum was revealed in a 2061 expose by
   Eleanor Tarquin
   of the
   <i key="922e576f-d0f8-4390-a49d-56e70add709a">
    Charleston Herald
   </i>
   , who volunteered to go undercover and learn the truth, following the trail blazed by
   Nellie Bly
   with her landmark investigation of the
   Women's Lunatic Asylum
   of
   Blackwell's Island
   . A month spent in Allegheny Asylum revealed horrific mistreatment. Many of the asylum patients were seemingly misdiagnosed and institutionalized without a significant presence of mental health issues (in most cases for financial gain).
  </p>
  <p key="eb3e38f8-3180-404f-93c1-6c08ae63f2e2">
   Tarquin reported that patients were kept restrained for long periods of time in tight confines with other patients. They had breaks from this imprisonment only for treatment, meals, and sleep. Treatment was largely forcing patients to be immersed in ice-cold water. Basic needs were fulfilled at the lowest possible criteria, with no process for patients to request humane accommodations for things like vegetarian meal plans or additional blankets.
  </p>
  <p key="d5113ff7-91b6-4771-9409-eaca90a25f8e">
   Before she could commit her experiences to paper, she still had to be released from the asylum. Tarquin's editor had to file multiple times for her release from the institution into his care. Apart from putting the daring journalist through unnecessary misery, it also indicated that family members who were willing or able to care for relatives in the facility were left in the cold because they were unable to pay for fees associated with the release procedure. The intent of Tarquin's assignment was to remain in the facility for up to 10 days, but even with aggressively documented and funded attempts to release her, she remained in the facility for a month - all the while any interested individual could pay the hospital for a guided tour of the facility. Ostensibly intended for doctors and health professionals but not always the case, family members were not allowed to visit patients unless they could pay for this expensive and secretive "lunatic tourism" offering, and there was no guarantee that they would be able to see their family member without paying additional fees.
  </p>
  <p key="7fe6da28-c9c7-4e7f-a962-3d1c28545533">
   Once the article was released, the revelation of the asylum being used by its management as a money-making scheme and the abuses perpetrated in the name of "healing" forced its closure. However, although the asylum closed down on March 17, 2061, the effect on the patients' welfare was marginal. Patients who did not qualify for a move to
   Watoga
   's facilities were discharged en masse with only a perfunctory attempt to contact their living relatives. Hospitals and doctors throughout the region were suddenly overwhelmed with all of the cases that they had quietly swept away over the years, and unsurprisingly some just swept them away again.
   This caused a massive swell in the region's homeless population, resulting in a public health crisis - swept under the rug by Watoga and the rich as a problem that did not affect them.
  </p>
  <p key="cb646248-75cf-4b89-be37-117871d8c805">
   No charges were pressed against
   Doctor Kessle
   and the rest of the hospital administration, even as the already high population of homeless, itinerant workers in the region swelled.
   The stigmatized mental patients were further victimized by the endless
   media
   coverage about the threat that they posed to the region.

   The hospital would become a park and its guards would help maintain the property by keeping trespassers away from the main building, calling animal control to remove aggressive animals, and to call the authorities to remove former patients seeking either help or a place to squat.

   saw the closed-down asylum gain a new lease at life for a few months, as a field trip organized by
   Clara Duran
   , the history teacher from
   Watoga High School
   , became the new tenants. The asylum was still fully furnished, with numerous facilities to ensure its self-sufficiency, including a water treatment plant, dairy, and of course, strong walls with intact windows providing shelter from the deadly Appalachian winter.
   By January, having survived the winter, the former Watogans were looking at a brighter future thanks to intense training, a
   dairy cow
   (
   Bertha
   ) captured the previous year, and even some
   chickens
   . They were even starting to make forays into other survivor communities to trade the chem stock found at the asylum for essential supplies. Barring domestic issues things were looking good, despite the building's structure not being as stable as once believed.
  </p>
  <p key="9300492b-2bf4-4b4e-b2ac-50f7800fcf58">
   Their luck ran out in March
   2078
   . The fledgling collective was attacked by a group of raiders who killed the dairy cow and all the chickens for meat before taking off. The Allegheny survivors split into two groups in the aftermath. One half left for
   Monongah
   , unwilling to continue working with Watogans. The other half, uniting behind Duran, decided to make a break for
   Harpers Ferry
   and beyond to look for survivors there.
   With the passage of time and lack of maintenance, the property deteriorated, eventually becoming home to many
   feral ghouls
   .

   Within the first week, the personnel managed to secure the first floor and clean up several rooms for their personal use. Among them was

   arrived to survey the property. He immediately checked the entire property and then began asking the personnel questions, such as how many breaches were in the walls, how many doors there were, as well as if there were any unsecured doors or windows. Eventually, he decided that they would have to abandon one wing of the building and the entire first floor, essentially throwing away all the plans the personnel had. His new plans included getting the elevator running and installing military-grade security that Squire
   Gary Weber
   found on a salvage run.
   All this was eventually completed; the last piece to be brought online was the elevator, which needed extra work on its hydraulics. However, this only happened after Squire
   Enrique Belmonte
   was stuck in there for three hours.

   By 2093, after the abandonment of
   Camp Venture
   and consolidation of all forces (barring Thunder Mountain),
   Fort Defiance served as headquarters for the established Appalachian branch of the Brotherhood of Steel.
   By January 2094, it continued to serve as the front line to contain the scorchbeasts unleashed by the Enclave, as well as the subsequent
   Scorched Plague
   . The pressure of this, however, would lead to the collapse of the chapter. Having to resort to even harsher supply requisitions
   and seeing a continued loss of ground to a plague, the Brotherhood tried one last desperate measure to at least curtail the source of the plague,
   Operation Touchdown
   . After the operation, no scorchbeasts were seen for a few weeks, leading the rest of the Brotherhood to assume the operation was a success, albeit one with a heavy cost.
  </p>
  <p key="62e64aff-1b04-414b-b13e-00d015bc8da5">
   This was not the case, and the scorchbeasts returned in greater numbers.
   Fort Defiance fell on August 18, 2095, and Thunder Mountain fell the following day,
   with all members manning their posts until the end.
  </p>
  <p key="d44f7c76-088a-499b-9323-040678c01eea">
   For the next few years, the facility lay abandoned, barring ferals and other creatures which moved in. Though other factions attempted to investigate the Brotherhood's fall, all were unsuccessful in reaching the asylum,
   and it remained undisturbed until the emergence of
   Vault 76
   dwellers
   in
   2102
   . With the return of people to the region in
   2103
   , the building became occupied by
   Jonah Ito
   , who is revisiting in remembrance of his sister
   Kaede
   , who died with the Brotherhood while defending the asylum.

   The outer courtyard contains a large fortification surrounding an

   and a sonic generator which must be defended during
   Line in the Sand

  <p key="74f46dcd-8e22-48ad-88c6-6531b551ad6b">
   Fort Defiance's interior consists of four floors, with the fourth one only accessible through an elevator protected by a laser grid which is unlocked by completing
   Recruitment Blues
   and obtaining a
   military ID card
   .
   The southern wing is infested with feral ghouls and is mostly in disarray because the Brotherhood never decided to repair and clear out that section. A
   wendigo
   may spawn in the room with the breaker panel.
  </p>
  <p key="2a5654bd-1f17-435c-8780-58061efd0c7f">
   The main entrance leads to a hallway flanked by two offices for the staff (and the Brotherhood after their takeover). Jonah Ito is camped out in one of the offices, and has set up a
   turret
   in the entrance to the derelict southern wing to defend himself. Until the player character gains access to the Brotherhood areas, they can only explore the southern wing.
  </p>
  <p key="1e7ae694-59f8-42a9-9a6b-22067a55567a">
   The southern wing encompasses three floors filled with the remnants of the asylum's dark past and the survivors who tried to make it their home. Among the derelict cells is a power switch that activates the doors leading into the northern wing of the facility, which was used by the Brotherhood of Steel as headquarters. The three floors include numerous storage rooms, personal rooms, and workbenches.
  </p>
  <p key="643f2d53-18f6-4d26-bcb1-e8e1b054c96f">
   However, the top floor, where Paladin Taggerdy's office is located, is inaccessible until the player character becomes a member of the Brotherhood of Steel during
   Recruitment Blues
   . The final room, containing the Paladin's chambers, does not become available until the player character locates Taggerdy's ID in
   glassed cavern
   during
   Belly of the Beast
   . The only known people who could access the top floor were the original members of
   Taggerdy's Thunder
   ,
   Scribe Grant McNamara
   ,
   Knight "Tex" Rogers
   , and
   Squire Belmonte
   .
  </p>
  <p key="66d1dc23-5294-4f07-8f46-2cbf7addbdf7">
   Scorched occupy the outside of the building while feral ghouls occupy most of the first and second floors. The third floor is infested by multiple radroaches and a few ants, as well as multiple bloodbugs and possibly bloatflies and mole rats. The real danger of this area is the upper floors, which are patrolled by a wendigo that can sometimes stray to the bottom floors.

    Fort Defiance is based on the
    Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum
    , also known as Weston State Hospital, in the town of
    Weston, West Virginia
    . In 2007, the building was sold for $1.5 million and was made into a museum about the history of the mental institution. Lead artist
    Nathan Purkeypile
    visited the asylum-turned-museum while scouting out West Virginia for the game, and speculated that he took the most pictures there out of any location.

    The sonic generator at Fort Defiance was created by art intern
    Cole Larson
    , who was in charge of designing, modeling and texturing all variants of it in 3ds Max and Substance Painter.
