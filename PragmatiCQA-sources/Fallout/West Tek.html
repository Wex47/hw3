  <p key="cc5b9c34-4f1d-460a-9a29-d737e5f9d349">
   West Tek was founded in
   2002
   , consisting of two divisions: Advanced Weapons and Biomedical Sciences Research.
   Its early projects included the
   X277 magnetic rail cannon
   . Although powerful, the cost of fielding such a weapon on a mass scale were considered too extreme and the project was shelved in
   2044
   .
   In
   2055
   , following the emergence of the
   <a href="New Plague.html" key="56678aa1-0d75-45fe-b7d7-1d6e879c6d95" title="New Plague">
    New Plague
   </a>
   , the company focused its biomedical research efforts on developing a cure for the contagion.
   Although unsuccessful, it would lead to West Tek being chosen to develop a general immunity virion nearly twenty years later.
  </p>
  <p key="fbc8dbfb-f9c4-45d9-bf22-dee6748562e5">
   In
   2065
   ,
   West Tek joined the
   power armor
   research initiative. Although the early prototypes proved to be unworkable in the field, they paved the way for breakthroughs in other fields, military and civilian.
   The key achievement of the project was the creation of the first portable
   fusion
   cell in
   2066
   .
   The invasion of Alaska by
   Chinese forces
   a few months later forced the military and participating companies to improvise and speed up their schedule.
   West Tek was the first to beat its competitors to the punch by developing the
   power armor frame
   and the first practical series of power armor, the
   T-45 model D
   .
   The first mechanized infantry units equipped with T-45d power armor were deployed to the Alaskan front less than a year later.
   Although lacking in mobility, they were effective in stemming the Chinese onslaught, thanks to their ability to carry heavy ordinance into battle with ease.
   West Tek also developed portable, military-grade laser weapons, paving the way for industrial giants like
   Wattz Electronics
   .
   By
   2069
   , it was the single largest defense contractor for the
   <a href="Federal government.html" key="4685ad15-fa0d-41e3-a773-9f4eb3c3e769" title="Federal government">
    United States government
   </a>
   . Its largest contract was the
   T-51 power armor
   ,
   which would not be completed for another seven years.
  </p>
  <p key="d347c011-eb9d-41ab-928a-8a2b64bacf82">
   In
   2073
   , West Tek was contracted to develop a general immunization agent against the
   <a href="New Plague.html" key="9790b0a0-b0a8-4493-8c6f-45045702c627" title="New Plague">
    New Plague
   </a>
   and biochemical weapons used by
   China
   . Their viral research efforts from 2055 onwards played a major role in the selection process.
   This generalized immunity virion was designated the
   <a href="Forced Evolutionary Virus.html" key="3c1767de-8089-4bfb-9d0a-08cdf52a2314" title="Forced Evolutionary Virus">
    Pan-Immunity Virion Project
   </a>
   and formed on September 15.
   Early experiments with the virion resulted in an increase in muscle mass and induction of cell replication.
   This attracted the attention of West Tek's military liaison,
   Major Barnett
   , who immediately ordered further experiments in that direction in
   March, 2075
   . Subsequent successful experimentation on flatworms and small mammals confirmed the viability of PVP as an evolutionary mutagen, now designated the
   <a href="Forced Evolutionary Virus.html" key="8294b4ff-b993-4150-9986-b982b127cd35" title="Forced Evolutionary Virus">

   .
  </p>
  <p key="5ce14083-454d-42e5-91c3-2a4c10b2fdde">
   The last attempt to continue the PVP line of experimentation was the Greenhouse Initiative, which attempted to use the mutagenic potential of PVP to create edible plants and vegetation that could greatly increase food production and combat the shortages that led to the food riots rocking the country.
   The town of

   was selected as the test site, resulting in an economic boom.
   Although the company would purchase test rights from local farmers as late as December 2075, the project was at an end.
  </p>
  <p key="b6dcc637-9a4b-42ba-853e-44166b8674c9">
   On
   January 6, 2076
   , the military secured West Tek research sites in the name of national security.
   Among others, a military detachment under the command of Colonel
   Robert Spindel
   was deployed to the
   <a class="mw-redirect" href="West Tek Research Facility.html" key="92f04213-71bc-4911-946f-306eeabb34b9" title="West Tek Research Facility">
    West Tek Research Facility
   </a>
   , bringing it under military control.
   West Tek was effectively nationalized,
   and the development of FEV continued apace, with support from the military's own advisory teams. New genetic sequences were spliced into FEV, gradually turning it into a shifting-absorptive virus that had little in common with the original Pan-Immunity Virion. It did, however, result in increased intelligence, dexterity, muscle mass, and resiliency to pathogens and cancer.
  </p>
  <p key="6ee43b72-e113-4b62-b707-88ec3e50385e">
   The Greenhouse Initiative was scrapped and the researchers reassigned to other projects
   as West Tek decided to use its Appalachian branch to focus on experimenting with FEV to determine its practical limits, with

   as proving grounds for low-level FEV exposure experiments and source of test subjects.
   The Advanced Weapons and Laser Development divisions completed their own projects by the end of the year, resulting in the
   T-51 power armor
   being put into production after testing and further iteration by the Army Corps of Engineers at
   Fort Strong
   .

   , including a significant portion of West Tek's research staff, ignoring recommendations against human testing from the personnel.
   In Appalachia, where human testing was already ongoing, advanced mutation experiments continued around the clock for the duration of 2077.
   The experiments created stable mutations that would become known as the
   snallygaster
   and the
   Grafton Monster
   ,
   By the time of the Great War, most of West Tek's personnel in California were already dead, killed by Roger Maxson's forces in response to the research they discovered taking place there.

   Under the leadership of
   Charles Ringhold
   , the primary research goal of this division was the creation of the
   power armor
   .
   The first suits were created and deployed on the
   Anchorage frontline
   to reclaim it from the Chinese.
   Although lacking the mobility of future versions, the
   T-45d suits
   performed at the height of specifications.
   The pinnacle of research was the T-51b powered combat infantry armor, though it was later re-engineered into the

   Excavator power armor
   was another venture in collaboration with the
