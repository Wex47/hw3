   Since subjugating the desolate region of the
   Grand Canyon
   beginning in 2247, he has since forged his legion conquering 87 tribes, assimilated from the former Southwestern
   United States
   .
   The militaristic might Caesar's Legion achieved completely pacified the lands that the Legion occupied, but safe roads were only the first step to fully realizing a permanent Legion that could continue after his rule. The next great step was to expand westward and acquire a real "Rome" in the form of
   New Vegas
   that could be the base of his new empire. But, before they can continue westward, Caesar and his followers must deal with the
   New California Republic

   as Edward Sallow, Caesar was once a citizen of the
   New California Republic
   . Following the death of his father at the hands of raiders in
   2228
   , his mother sought the protection of the

   . While she worked for the Followers, cooking and cleaning in their library, the young Edward learned how to read and started taking courses, provided by the organization free of charge.
   Taught to "bring the torch of knowledge to the wastes", Sallow was a student of uneven quality.
   Though he was highly intelligent, his success in scientific pursuits was only proportional to his interest in the given subject nor was he particularly popular among his peers, due to his bad temper. For Sallow, the Followers were never an inspiring example, their devotion to scholarship too stifling, and their mission of enlightenment too naive.

   sent a group to the
   Grand Canyon
   to study the region’s tribal languages.
   The group included Followers Edward Sallow,

   , a specialist in tribal dialects. On the way to the canyon, Sallow and his companions happened upon a cache of historical books, including
   <i key="304bb120-745e-409d-badd-372d32851619">
    The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire
   </i>

   <i key="fd897c8b-73e3-4657-b003-15d934c129bc">

   </i>
   by Gaius Julius Caesar. Sallow studied the books rigorously for two weeks, not yet aware of their coming significance.
   Subsequently, the group was captured by the
   Blackfoot tribe
   and held for ransom.
  </p>
  <p key="db3a31a8-f8e0-43f5-a093-6fa59fe3d70c">
   Sallow saw the weakness of the tribe , who were currently at war with seven others in the region, outnumbered and bound to lose. Unwilling to sink with them, Sallow decided to take certain steps. Objections from Calhoun went unheard.
   Sallow taught the tribe how to properly maintain their firearms, properly shoot targets, and reload ammunition, after which he began teaching them how to make explosives and drilling in small unit tactics, all of which was based on old books he had recently read.
   Once they were ready, Sallow led them against the
   Ridgers
   , their weakest enemy.
  </p>
  <p key="a36fe5a0-1bf5-4e2d-b1ec-50f8225d4173">
   When the tribe refused to surrender, he ordered every man, woman, and child killed. No exceptions were made. The Blackfoot moved on under Sallow's lead, surrounding the
   Kaibabs
   tribe. Upon their refusal to surrender, Sallow took their envoy to the ruins of the Ridgers' village. The piles of corpses were a shocking sight to a tribesman who had only experienced small examples of war, but what Sallow had led was total warfare.

  <p key="d3e763e7-fbf4-4839-92c8-648be039ea12">
   The Kaibabs promptly surrendered rather than suffer the same fate, then the
   Fredonians
   , then all the remaining tribes.
   Sallow was acutely aware that the root cause of all the problems was tribal identities, leading to internecine conflict and preventing any substantial recovery. He knew what had to be done.
   He had to erase all traces of tribal identities and substitute a single, monolithic culture in their place.
  </p>
  <p key="91059c7c-79af-4117-8533-f27dbd2cc196">
   In 2247,
   when his confederation was large enough, Sallow crowned himself as Caesar, leader of the Great Tribe: the Legion.
   He deliberately patterned his new society after imperial
   Rome
   .
   He soon began putting his words into practice. Calhoun was sent back west to warn that Caesar should not be interfered with, while Graham stayed with Caesar, becoming the Legion's first
   legate
   .
   In the decades that followed, the Legion conquered minor holdings in
   Utah
   and
   Colorado
   , while the entirety of Arizona and a sizeable portion of
   New Mexico
   were brought under its control.
  </p>
  <p key="d85de7e5-3a58-4add-9448-f5dea88dfca5">
   Tribes were forcibly assimilated into the Legion, while cities and their inhabitants lived on as subjects of the Legion. Each tribe Caesar fought against and assimilated were primitive even by the standards of the post-nuclear world, with nothing even remotely comparable to what existed out west. No towns, no roads, no meaningful industry. One by one, they fell to the superior forces marshaled by Sallow.
  </p>
  <p key="e7e79957-2768-4965-bb26-1e235f75fd51">
   Betweeen 2248 and 2274, Caesar conquered and assimilated more tribes, forging a well-organized, culturally insular fighting force that expanded steadily across the region. His Legion conquered tribes of southeastern Utah, southwestern Colorado, the western edge of New Mexico and the northern half of Arizona.
   By 2250 he had declared himself the Son of Mars. By 2255, he had established a capital amid the ruins of Flagstaff.
   Caesar's ultimate goal is to conquer the
   New California Republic
   and merge its civilian culture and infrastructure with the military strength of the Legion, creating a new totalitarian empire.
   Foreign to anyone outside its ranks, the highly militarized autocracy adept at integrating conquered cultures formed the perfect template for a society that could adapt to the challenges of the post-apocalyptic world and thrive, establishing prosperity and peace: a new

   The Legion would be a nationalist, imperialist, totalitarian, completely homogenous culture that would focus on long-term stability at all costs.

   The Republic has the distinction of being recognized by Caesar as a worthy adversary and conflict with the NCR was inevitable. He sees himself as Caesar returning from his conquest of Gaul and the NCR as the corrupt Roman Senate.
   A textbook example of
   Hegelian
   dialectics, where the thesis and antithesis conflict, creating a synthesis when the conflict is resolved.
   When the Legion conquers the NCR, it will be transformed from a republic crippled by bureaucracy, corruption, and gridlock into a highly efficient military dictatorship. The Legion will become a standing army protecting all the citizens of the new empire and the absolute power of its dictator.

   The New California Republic was not willing to roll over and surrender. In
   2271
   , the Legion's presence served as a catalyst for the
   Ranger Unification Treaty
   .

   Subsequently, a series of skirmishes and smaller battles (such as the destruction of
   Fort Aradesh
   out east) occured, and the Legion forced a confrontation. In 2277, the Legion faced the NCR at
   Hoover Dam
   , in what became known as the
   First Battle of Hoover Dam
   . Discovered by
   Ulysses
   , a frumentarius, the dam was a symbolic
   Rubicon
   . At the time, Caesar's forces under the command of the Joshua Graham marched against the NCR garrison at Hoover Dam, in an attempt to take the strategic asset and river crossing. However, Graham's elite troops were drawn into a trap laid by
   Chief Hanlon
   of the
   New California Republic Rangers
   . As General
   Lee Oliver
   's soldiers held the line, Rangers and Army sharpshooters targeted the Legion's commanders (primarily
   centurions
   and
   decanii
   ), sowing chaos among the common legionaries. When the Legate, unable to adapt to new strategies in combat, ordered his elite forces to punch through and pursue Rangers decimating his officers, the Rangers and
   First Recon
   sharpshooters executed a tactical retreat into
   Boulder City
   . Elements of the Army and Rangers kept the Legion engaged long enough to allow the most experienced legionaries to enter the city. When they did, the Republic's forces pulled out of the city. Once most of them were safe (soldiers and rangers trapped behind Legion lines had to be abandoned), they triggered explosives packed into the buildings in advance.
  </p>
  <p key="cfb68012-37f7-4ec6-af68-5df5d91d51d0">
   Chief Hanlon's plan went off without a hitch. The exploding buildings acted as giant fragmentation bombs, killing and maiming most of the legionaries and leaving the rest in a state of shock; effectively crippling their offensive. The Army and Rangers followed the detonation with a counter-attack, pushing back and eventually routing the Legion forces and forcing the Malpais Legate to retreat from the cam back to the east of the Colorado River. Flanking attacks at
   Camp Golf
   and other camps in the Mojave were similarly repulsed.
   The Malpais Legate returned to Caesar in shame. To demonstrate that failure is not tolerated, even at the highest of ranks, Caesar ordered Graham to be burned alive. The former Legate was covered in pitch, lit on fire, and thrown into the
   Grand Canyon
   . This was the worst defeat in Legion's history.
  </p>
  <p key="f26e5086-f232-492d-91dd-02f7fc49abd3">
   Graham was replaced by Legate
   Lanius
   , who embarked on a campaign of expansion eastward to subjugate further tribes for the Legion and gather forces for another confrontation with the Republic.
   Over the next four years, Caesar rebuilt his army with 14 newly assimilated tribes,
   creating the finest possible blade with which to cleave through the Republic. The Legion's increasing power was accompanied by a noticeable decline in Caesar's health. Once healthy, his face became sunken and sickly, his nature more reclusive. But the worst were the headaches, increasing in strength and frequency, affecting his ability to lead. Although they remained silent, the decline was visible to his officers, but Caesar denied these problems, lashing out at any queries.
   The first hints of what might have been the problem appeared only a couple months prior with infrequent headaches. The headaches recurred increasingly along with blanking out mid-conversation. The most recent symptom to occur is Caesar's left leg stiffening and him being only able to drag it.
   While Caesar is untrained to diagnose himself, he's figured that he's likely suffering from a brain tumor, but defers to a professional's opinion on the diagnosis.

   The bedrock of Caesar's philosophy is that service to the state is not just the highest virtue, it is the
   <i key="c6dedeb4-e6b1-4bc7-bde0-ad897b68b06f">
    only
   </i>
   virtue. Caesar is critical of NCR society as its leaders care not for the "greater good". This is contrary to Caesar's belief that "an individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war, or production." He views the
   <a href="Great War.html" key="2d93abe0-db5b-4626-9399-5f3696f51713" title="Great War">
    Great War
   </a>
   of 2077 as a chance for humanity to start over and aims to unify humanity under one banner or eliminate them should they refuse. Reading through old world books, Caesar has gained knowledge of the old glory of Imperial Rome and has used the ignorance of his followers to claim that he is Caesar, the son of Mars, the God of War, and not Edward Sallow, former Follower of the Apocalypse.
  </p>
  <p key="32454ae6-5a67-4cef-910e-9678e60b2c67">
   Aside from total military defeat, Caesar's greatest fear is being exposed as a fraud. Most members of the Legion, excluding some of the most trusted ones, are oblivious to the fact that the Legion's culture is based on books about ancient Rome – they believe that all of the customs enforced by Caesar were dictated to him by Mars himself. Those who claim otherwise are viewed as ultimate blasphemes and are likely to be executed. While some of the newly captured slaves are skeptical, they don't tend to be vocal about it, and their children are taken away from their parents to be raised by Caesar's priestesses.
   Secretly, Caesar still doesn't feel like a real Emperor of Rome – with his loose nation of savages, he still thinks of himself as merely a barbaric king of the Gauls.
   Caesar desires two things: a Carthage, and a Rome; by seizing
   New Vegas
   , Caesar felt that he would finally be able to elevate his Legion into a legitimate nation by giving it its own "Rome" by destroying the NCR, Caesar's "Carthage" – transforming them from a nomadic army into a true empire; a militaristic, imperialist, autocratic, culturally homogeneous empire whose ruler holds undisputed power - a "Pax Romana" which would prevent humanity from ever fracturing itself again.
  </p>
  <p key="05cad106-8636-445d-83d1-8262dd30310b">
   Caesar regards the NCR as only an extension of the corruption that existed during the Old World and that it is ultimately doomed to repeat the same mistakes. He sees in it similar attributes associated with the Roman Republic before Julius Caesar seized power; extensive bureaucracy, corruption, senatorial infighting and filled with a people driven solely by greed and personal gain. It exists as the antithesis to the Legion and as a catalyst for change that only a confrontation with it can bring; a clash he sees as an inevitable product of Hegelian dialectics.
   The conflict is a vital one, not only for the future of his Legion strategically but also philosophically; the NCR is the first of his enemies to which he is truly ideologically opposed and the first that can truly test the strength of his Legion, as well as his philosophy.
  </p>
  <p key="15c445e8-f6cb-46d1-841d-45b91b4f1b17">
   In his view, the NCR does not have a long-term solution to the problems of the Wasteland - the bombs had reset humanity's progress and he believed the time had come to rebuild it into something new.
   He argues that NCR is weakened by its democracy, and that it was at its strongest when under the dominating rule of its second president –
   <a href="Tandi.html" key="43162e9e-a3af-4302-b533-8bc484eb8bd2" title="Tandi">
    Tandi
   </a>
   – whose popularity was such she remained leader of the NCR for most of her life until her death as the senate would never dare oppose her. He was taught to venerate her as a child and observes that she was ultimately more of a queen than an elected official and that it is similar centralized power that a new civilization needs.
   In the eyes of Caesar, the NCR that came after Tandi's presidency has been blighted with greed and widespread corruption because of the oligarchical control of politicians and
   brahmin barons
   looking out for only their interests instead of the greater good and its citizens. Caesar is simply quickening what is the inevitable, logical conclusion of the once virtuous NCR.
  </p>
  <p key="5ec680cf-82ee-4c35-9d3a-d1358d01fc4b">
   Caesar also regards self-sacrifice as a necessary part of rebuilding civilization, as evidenced by the fact that he refuses the very notion of using the
   Securitrons
   hidden inside the bunker underneath his camp. Caesar rejects allowing his Legion to advance technologically, believing that life must be kept hard and filled with sacrifice in order to strengthen humanity.
   He has similarly kept his people ignorant of mankind's former knowledge of medical science, allowing his Legion to get by on primitive healing powders while he himself keeps an Auto-Doc in his tent for both his personal use as well as a "gift" to anyone Caesar favors.
   Similarly, drugs and alcohol are completely forbidden from being used by legionaries,
   so most legionaries must make do with previously mentioned healing powder,
   bitter drink
   or concocting new remedies like
   Hydra
   , all with the caveat that the pain remains.

    Caesar is based on the real world historical entity of the
    Julius Caesar
    , and possesses a number of parallels to his historical counterpart. For example, the historical Caesar actually suffered from a

    similar to the one depicted in-game. He had headaches, blackouts, and sometimes even seizures. In terms of appearance, Caesar is balding and has an
    Aquiline nose
    , a sign of nobility in ancient Rome. One thing of note is that Caesar is 55 years old in 2281, and the historical Julius Caesar was assassinated at the age of 56 on March 15, 44 B.C.

      Can you explain the similarities between Mr. Kurtz, and Caesar?
      Both are men of intelligence and education who traveled from a life of relative comfort, technological wizardry, and "civilization" into a wilderness full of warring people with relatively low education and a relatively "primitive" lifestyle. Both rose to power and were essentially deified for their intelligence, knowledge and leadership capabilities. Both cut off communication with the outside world and lived in their (until now) remote, savage kingdoms, using the most brutal means possible to deal with rare instances of dissent. Both have an "unusual" way of looking at the world due to their cultural isolation.
      Unlike Mr. Kurtz, Caesar's reign continues for a long, long time.

      On a related note, at least one source of real-world inspiration for Caesar was Charles Taylor of Liberia. Charles Taylor is a real dude. For real. Go read some of the trial transcripts where his war crimes are detailed. The shit that went down in Liberia (and Sierra Leone) on his command makes F:NV's Caesar's Legion look moderately cruel.

      I've never thought of Caesar's or the Legion's activities as "edgy". For their own purposes, they engage in a variety of horrible practices that others have engaged in throughout history. I'm sure individual players might want to engage in ranking atrocities -- something I've never really found was productive in discussions about history -- but Caesar and his crew in the same league as other brutal warlords. He was inspired (on our end) by people like Charles Taylor, Timur, and Simon de Montfort (the crusader). "Caesar" is a persona he adopted, but he effectively operates as a warlord with no regard for individual human lives outside of how he can use them.

      RE: Caesar’s Karma being neutral: I believe at the time my rationale for that Karma setting is that Caesar is in a Mr. Kurtz-like state of unmoored morality. Whatever moral framework he had as Edward Sallow among the Followers has disintegrated after years of being Caesar.  I.e., it’s not so much that his Karma is neutral as much as it is alien.
That said, I don’t feel strongly about that designation and largely feel that the Karma system was vestigial in New Vegas. If we’re trying to encourage players to form their own opinions about factions and individuals, having a design layer that assigns (essentially) alignment is weird.
