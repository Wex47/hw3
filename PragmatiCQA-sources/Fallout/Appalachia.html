   By the late 21st century, Appalachia's political and economic landscape shifted away from its frontier roots and mining but remained plagued by many of the same problems. Although mining remained a major part of its economy, West Virginia experienced a boom in other sectors, including ever-lucrative tourism, cutting-edge robots, defense, and many more. However, the pressures of the resource crisis and the rise of powerful megacorporations like

   Hornwright Industrial Mining Company

   As early as 2061, the region was rife with impoverished workers in the region struggling to make ends meet or provide for their families.
   Workers lost their jobs to rapid automation, many of whom had been working in the mines. RobCo Industries was a key player in the region's automation efforts.
   Its wide range of robots was ostensibly meant to replace human workers in jobs deemed too dangerous,
   but many people in Appalachia rightly saw them as a threat to their jobs.
   They replaced miners with the aptly-named
   Auto-Miners
   ,
   and even public servants such as the police and security were phased out in favor of Protectron equivalents.
   These automation efforts also extended to the military presence in Appalachia, with
   Camp McClintock
   being led by a
   Master Sergeant Gutsy
   ,
   as well as town mayorships with the
   MAIA
   Project.

   The
   Free States
   was one of the few well-organized groups in Appalachia that fought against this trend. Deeply suspicious of the motives of the government, military, and big money, they were vilified as political agitators and traitors.
   Persecution by the United States military and accusations of treason culminated in the Free States openly seceding from the nation and retreating to fortified bunkers erected across

  <p key="118eef20-c711-4646-b30f-ee175a2a30d3">
   The frenzied campaign of automation culminated with Ballot Measure 6. Set for a vote in November, the measure would issue a $2.6 billion bond to begin the process of replacing all human workers in the Appalachian government with automated systems, with the goal of complete automation by 2087.
   Although it was touted as a way to eliminate unwanted bureaucracy,
   this boasting was pushed by a source with lots of money, while the
   <i key="fe40f783-7e48-4a0e-b511-4b9125f8b3a3">
    Charleston Herald
   </i>
   sought proof that it was none other than Hornwright Industrial.
   Among the many opponents of the measure, Senator
   Sam Blackwell
   was the most notable, advocating against what he described as a "slow-moving disaster" that would leave the people with nothing but pink slips and empty bellies.
   Blackwell's reputation was later tarnished and he resigned after it was revealed he had close ties to the Free States movement and its leader, Raleigh Clay.
   Behind the scenes, Hornwright Industries CEO
   Daniel Hornwright
   had a hand in intimidating Blackwell and his family.

   The unrest boiled over in early October
   2077
   . When families were forced out of the town of
   Welch
   by Atomic Mining Services,
   the locals of Appalachia began to fight back,
   resulting in full-scale riots beginning on October 3.
   The bloodshed was particularly severe around the area later known as the Ash Heap. On Mount Blair, miners seized the Rockhound owned by Hornwright Industrial, in an operation led by
   Mick Flanagan
   ,
   and caused damages that the company estimated to be in the tens of millions.
   However, by October 12, the
   National Guard
   cleared out the last of the rioters by force and returned control of the Rockhound to Hornwright.
   Another group of rioters, led by
   O'Conner
   , bombed the
   Mega Mansions
   in
   Bramwell
   that were owned by the mining companies.
   They used stolen blasting explosives to topple one of the Mega Mansions, killing two and wounding several.

   A more symbolic battle took place in 2077, as well; a highly publicized mining contest between the automation-focused Hornwright Industrial and the more worker-friendly
   Garrahan Mining Company
   .
   In a race that captured the media's attention, Hornwright deployed its
   Auto-Miner
   units, while Garrahan fielded their tenacious
   Excavator power armor
   to settle once and for all, whether it was man or machine who reigned supreme.
   Both effortlessly chewed through the rock at their designated sites, and at the end of the day, Hornwright had the edge winning by a mere margin of 1.85 tons.
   Although victorious and poised to implement its plans for Appalachia on a great scale, the victory was short-lived, thanks to the

   During the events of the Great War, Appalachia sustained multiple nuclear detonations, both in and around the region. A nuclear detonation was felt near
   mine site Kittery
   in the region later known as the Ash Heap.
   An undetermined amount also detonated in the general vicinity of
   Grafton
