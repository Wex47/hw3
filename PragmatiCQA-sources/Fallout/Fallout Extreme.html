   On November 22, 2000 the game's
   proposal
   was presented to Interplay, but was rejected and never materialized. Its existence was unknown until the design document was leaked online on January 27, 2010.
   The game was in development for several months in 2000 but never had a concrete development team. All that is known is
   Brian Christian
   , the head of 14° East, was the lead producer, and
   Todd J. Camasta
   was the art director. It never proceeded past the conceptual phase, but would have used the Unreal Engine.

   The game would have been able to be played in the first or third person perspective. The player would control a four person squad of specialized characters, and be able to switch the active member at any moment. The squad could consist of ordinary wastelanders, former Brotherhood of Steel members, super mutants, and Native American and Mongol warriors. Single and multiplayer modes were planned for the game, including squad campaign, deathmatch, capture the flag, assault, squad deathmatch, squad capture the flag, and squad assault.

  <p key="148e41ec-173e-4002-ac05-36e73d10dd1c">
   It was not going to be just a shooter, but rather "a game of action, tactics, and strategies where moving into position, planning and falling back is just as essential as having the biggest guns." The world map was divided into territories, each of which had different layouts, populated by various enemies and different geographical strategic significance. One's strategy would come into play based not only on the tactics employed for a given mission; as the dynamics of each mission would be different based on whether the player entered the territory from the west, south, north, etc. For example: to get to a particular territory one could choose either to charge through an enemy stronghold or to sneak around through adjacent territories in order to flank the enemy.
  </p>
  <p key="c64cf47f-bb81-44bb-8ca8-5a6faf065a1f">
   Missions would also be interconnected and your choices would have consequences. For example: if the player destroyed a bridge in the territory of one mission, the enemy forces might be weakened in the next one because of a lack of reinforcements. Conquering and holding territories with productive towns would be essential for establishing and maintaining supply lines. If there was a supply camp nearby, the player's access to various kinds of weapons, ammunition, etc. would be constant and reliable. The player could even close off a territory, forcing enemy troops to pass through another territory where an ambush could be set up.
  </p>
  <p key="319b35be-e224-4cdb-bee8-61b1194ae4fd">
   After completing a given mission, the player would move their squad to outlying camp areas, where new characters for the roster squad (max. 16) could be recruited and different members could be assigned to the active four person squad for the next missions. Members of the roster not on the active squad could be sent as scouts to adjacent territories or deployed into newly conquered territories to hold the fort. If a character died, they would clear space in the roster, allowing the player to recruit new members.
  </p>
  <p key="63e56c7b-bb9e-4c71-aa16-ea30404c3ac1">
   At any time during a mission, the player could switch and control any of their four squad members, each of whom had different perks and specialize in different weapons. In the meantime, the other characters could be issued various standing orders. However, characters also had personality traits that would determine how they would react under different stresses. Each character would gain experience points, which would allow them to increase combat skills or unlock perks.

       According to the design document the game would have taken place almost a century after the Great War.
      </p>
      <p key="b6ea2f77-1e84-4107-a1fa-3f3d84cf1465">
       The Brotherhood of Steel, the "once silent organization," has been expanding and seizing more and more territory under their control. Their area of influence stretches as far as Alaska, where their new headquarters is now located. Their agenda "leaves little room for the survival of radiation or Forced Evolutionary Virus outbreak victims." Local humans are either drafted into their ranks as cannon fodder or enslaved, and mutants are outright eradicated. They are whom the player would oppose during the first half of the game.
      </p>
      <p key="b33f4c61-539d-496e-b9b9-1917ab21bd17">
       The player controls a squad of revolutionaries known as the Cause. Throughout the game, they would gain momentum, starting in Oregon, then north through Washington, Canada, and eventually reaching Alaska. Each reclaimed town would vow loyalty to the Cause.
      </p>
      <p key="22fb7729-a533-42e8-b228-bdcc947fe9e5">
       However, after defeating them, the player would learn why the Brotherhood set out to Canada and Alaska in the first place. The Cause must now venture across the Bering Strait, through the Russia, Mongolia and finally into China, in order to disarm the Doom's Day Missile that would obliterate what is left of the United States of America. The endgame would then take place within the Forbidden City, where the Chinese Emperor resides.

       Overview:
       The game was supposed to have approximately forty map locations or territories stretching from the Pacific Northwest to China, grouped into four distinct regions, each with its own visual style and special gameplay features, as well as weapons, artifacts, and denizens unique to it.
      </p>
      <p key="6d0cb7c3-b45f-46f6-b015-a25fdf9d9be1">
       Each territory would feature an unique layout with its own tactical set-ups and challenges, different resources, unique features that can be leveraged to affect other territories (such as opening or closing a dam that blocks the river and can starve areas downriver of water), geographic features such as passes or fordable rivers, and of course, border access.
      </p>
      <p key="78a799cb-4f52-41ba-912a-40d2b7344bd5">
       The player would also be able to encounter potential recruits for their growing revolution by exploring territories.

      <p key="4a631f3b-f335-4f68-8419-9aff3c79bfc2">
       Management
       Each territory would have a different featured map, enemy strength, weapon supplies, local friendliness, major story targets, and border connections to other areas. The player would be able to choose their approach, attacking territories head on, flanking them from adjacent regions, and of course taking supply lines into account.
      </p>
      <p key="ccff9d58-d91d-4c14-af11-7ac7f9366903">
       A supply line was a linked chain of supported camps. If one of the camps in the link was lost, it would break, and the player would have to retake the territory to regain it. Retaking camps was intended to be left to the player's discretion and their particular strategy and approach to each territory.
      </p>
      <p key="c3f628b8-da9c-47c5-b304-26ce57f4b55d">
       Supply lines would be tied to towns established in each territory, and their ability to manufacture war materiel. Each town would produce one specific weapon type. As such, conquering and defending territories against enemy forces was to be an important part of strategic gameplay: As long as supply lines were intact, the player would be able to use the camps as a reliable source of weapons and ammunition.
      </p>
      <p key="860a2122-a05c-4328-afc4-765888bd8f36">
       If these were cut, they'd have to rely on replenishing their stores from defeated enemies and capturing weapon stores. However, even if maintained, weapons and ammo would take time to arrive at the target forward camp: The further, the longer it takes. The player would be able to set up networks of supply chains and make them quite robust, by connecting existing camps together.

       Camps
       Forward camps would be automatically set up on territory borders, allowing an endless supply of ammunition, first aid, better intelligence and safer entrance and exfiltration of target territories. They would be placed automatically, and the player's squad would receive support if they were fighting in range of the camp's area of effect.
      </p>
      <p key="55050ec4-8376-4099-b6bc-c41eb6c254ec">
       Furthermore, the camps would be an interface for the player to manage their squad, interact with new squad members, collect and review intelligence, deploy remote territory governors, plan strategy, and of course, deploy to their next mission. These would be fully realized maps where the player would be able to walk their chosen squad member through and enter various tents to interact with camp features. These would be the Armory, Munitions, First Aid Station, Personnel, Command, and Signals tent.

       Enemies
       The enemy composition in territories would vary depending on circumstances. The default rosters and strength would change as the player cuts off supply lines and gathers intel, allowing them to gain tactical opportunities that enhance the effectiveness of their guerrilla war against the Brotherhood.

        General environment: Densely forested Pacific Northwest, a century after nuclear bombardment and heavy conventional warfare. Additional biological warfare (viruses) and nuclear fallout have mutated both flora and fauna. By the time the game starts, nature starts to regenerate and reassert itself. The primeval, exotic vegetation punctuates blackened stretches of devastation and isolated pockets of ruined urban landscapes.

       <li key="cba87df2-90ce-4cac-be0c-9476d5156798">
        Population: Refugees from the major urban populations banded into smaller settlements and medieval like townships. Isolated survivalists that are encountered remind one of Grizzly Adams. The Issaquah Nation presently controls the inland landscape.

       <li key="8a8eebd0-7c95-49df-976d-9a83020168b7">
        Gameplay summary: Layouts favor urban and guerilla warfare for two reasons: The plot starts out in shelled-out urban environments and the resulting experience epitomizes the game's squad-based gameplay. The player is encouraged to divide their squad, utilize different viewpoints and attack from multiple directions. Physical feats such as climbing, branch hopping, and jumping feature prominently, as do elevated points and towers to provide vantage points for snipers. Intermittent flat, open areas allow for tension-reducing major shootouts.

        General environment: Icy, cold, and hostile-but it was like that before the bombs fell. The presence of pre-Apocalyptic military bases brought some heavy conventional warfare just before and just after the bombs. Occasional hidden military compounds break up the icy landscapes.

        Population: The Brotherhood of Steel's newest headquarters are established here, and is the heart of their revitalized military machine. Placid Inuit tribes have in the post-nuclear world, turned into fierce territorial warriors and are the true masters of the land, running a resistance right under the Brotherhood's noses.

        Gameplay summary: Snow and ice introduce a dramatic environmental change. The challenge here will be about moving around in open territory. There are choice nooks and crannies in which to set up sniper shots and unexpected ambushes. The open flat fields and the dramatic contrast of white against character colors will change warfare dramatically. The objective will be to hit first, hard, and fast... or to be clever and sneak around. Villages, settlements, and the few areas of tangled cramped spaces will be a relief from the starkness of the opened snowfields. By the end of this phase, however, the characters should be strong enough and well educated enough to be able to handle open-ground combat with effectiveness. Rocks and steppes provide run cover-run tactics. In this environment, open ground combat will prove more difficult to master than the hide-and-peek tactics of the previous phase.

The territories here are larger but there aren't as many of them. Tactical play is focused on environment manipulation and affecting the way your enemy moves about the map. Once you close a hidden canyon, it is easier to set up an effective ambush. Indeed, much easier, because you can anticipate the enemies' movements.

        Gameplay summary: This is the endgame and will include territory layouts that require all the skills the player has acquired. There are open ground territories, cramped tactical spaces, fast-paced action, and slow careful hunts. There will be plenty of hazards unique to this environment. There are great looking hiding places that provide little or no cover from the camouflaged enemy. The player will be fighting in leafy bushes, river valleys or rice paddies. The enemy will remain hidden while still targeting you. Once the player gets to the Forbidden City, these hazards will be reduced. In the Forbidden City endgame, the enemies of course will be much harder and the player will have to use every ounce of skill he has picked up throughout the entire game.

      The new emperor resided within the Forbidden City, a large fortified palace inside the city. The Chinese remnants began building a nuclear missile here to wipe out the United States, known as the Doom's Day Missile. The Brotherhood of Steel learned of this and tried to invade Asia, but they were overtaken and destroyed by a gang known as The Cause before they could get there. This gang would go on to take the same mission and invade the city. They successfully managed to kill the Chinese Emperor and destroy the missile. The area was often attacked by the Horde of Huns from Mongolia.

  <p key="5f5a7c8d-1ad0-493b-ae6b-791bee1e09f2">
   The "once silent organization" has been expanding and seizing more and more territory under their control. Their area of influence stretches from Fort Williamette in Oregon into Alaska, where the Brotherhood's new headquarters is now located. The Brotherhood's agenda "leaves little room for the survival of radiation or FEV outbreak victims." Local humans are either drafted into the Brotherhood's ranks as cannon fodder or enslaved, and mutants are outright eradicated. It is the Brotherhood that the player would oppose during the first half of the game.
  </p>
  <p key="d07e7df2-0af0-40a9-b016-0feb193cebde">
   Eventually, their iron-fisted rule would result in the revolutionary force known as The Cause to rise up and overthrow them about a century after the Great War. However, it would be revealed that the post-War Chinese Empire still threatened the former United States, that the Brotherhood had sought to stop. The Cause would manage to cross the Bering Strait and end the threat of the Chinese Empire.

  </h3>
  <p key="103958d7-8216-42a5-8938-39df0e3229fc">
   Player characters are all members of The Cause, a group of revolutionaries, fighting first against the oppressive regime of the Brotherhood of Steel, and then Imperial China. This gang arose from the settlements around Mount Hood. After initial success in Washington and Oregon, destroying a major Brotherhood fort and gaining recruits from surrounding communities, they proceeded north. They pushed through Canada and into Alaska, wiping out Brotherhood positions and locations all the while.
  </p>
  <p key="ff206d15-d3f8-4ea1-b007-e532ef9f7e3c">
   Only after almost completely wiping out the organization do they learn the reason for the push north: Imperial China is constructing a Doom's Day Missile to completely destroy the remnants of the United States of America once and for all. The Brotherhood of Steel had been attempting to reach Beijing and destroy the missile before it can be completed.
  </p>
  <p key="3c156497-afa7-409d-8af2-6b8a160ad404">
   The Cause adopts the Brotherhood's mission, and crosses the Bering Strait into the remains of the Russia. They pass through Mongolia, fighting a group of raiders known as the Horde of Huns, and finally reach China. They defeat the Army of the Golden Tiger and New Imperial Guard, kill the Chinese Emperor, and ultimately destroy the nuclear missile.

        Caleb - Human, precision arms specialist. He would have been a member of The Cause, specialized in handling precision weaponry. The group's smart ass, the "pragmatic" one who can't believe he's joined up with such a group of losers; they're lucky they have him, or all would be lost. He is all precision and accuracy, no wasted shots. Doesn't mind showing off, either.
