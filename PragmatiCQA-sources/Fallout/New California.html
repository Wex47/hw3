   Its central location soon attracted plenty of traders, including

   One of the landmark decisions that would shape the wastelands for decades was the Hub's adoption of bottle caps as currency.
   Within ten years of the city's founding in 2093,
   caps became the standard currency of the wasteland.

   The wasteland seemed to be (relatively) peaceful for a time, with the occasional mutant attack on caravans. However, by 2102 these attacks intensified, causing significant losses in shipping.
   To find the source of the mutant threat,
   Harold
   joined forces with Richard Grey (an exile from
   Vault City
   ) and formed one of the first adventuring parties in the wasteland in order to find the source of the mutants. The party, accompanied by several other adventurers, set out from the Hub on May 22.
   A month later, on June 23, they discovered the
   <a href="Mariposa Military Base.html" key="d9d2e564-5b3a-4445-931e-94ddd3e95656" title="Mariposa Military Base">
    Mariposa Military Base
   </a>
   . Although it was sealed by the renegade U.S. troops, it was compromised by time and salvagers. Exposed to the F.E.V. in the vats, they started to mutate and infest the wasteland. The expedition was routed by the mutants remaining at the base. Grey was knocked into the vats, while Harold was knocked unconscious, awakening outside the base hours later.
   He was found four days later by traders and returned to the Hub. The incomplete exposure to F.E.V. caused drastic mutations to take place. As Harold changes into a ghoul-like mutant, his caravan partners and employees abandon him. The once-great caravan boss was left a pauper.
  </p>
  <p key="6a3f695d-0c84-4b32-aeac-bbcdddf39a24">
   In the meantime, Grey suffered terrible mutations due to an overdose of the F.E.V., much longer than anyone was ever meant to. He crawled out of the vats, suffering from the effects of mutation, fading in and out of consciousness. He recorded his state in the brief windows of conscious thought.
   The mutation stabilized by the end of July and Grey slowly acclimatized to his condition. He began the first experiments on animals in Mariposa. By November, he had formulated the cornerstone of the philosophy of

   His experiments on humans that wandered into Mariposa allowed him to identify critical flaws in the mutation process and establish a procedure for creating super mutants. He began building an army from the subjects his mutants capture and Unity was born.

  <p key="a396fe4b-9052-497f-8b95-07b244e24042">
   While the Master developed his plans for improving the human race, life continued as normal. By 2120, the Hub was rapidly growing. Angus, its founder, established himself as governor.
   Angus' prosperous reign was interrupted by a failed raid by the Vipers, stopped by him almost singlehandedly.
   This victory did not stop his murder in winter of 2125, which threw the city into chaos.
   Less then a year later, a band of merchants seized the water tower pumping water out of the oasis for sale and demanded excessive payments for water, sparking the
   Great Merchant Wars
   .
   The conflict continued for two years, as while the
   Water Merchants
   sealed up the town, they were greatly outnumbered. In 2128,
   Roy Greene
   managed to negotiate a settlement. The reforms include the establishment of Hub's Central Council staffed by representatives from the trade companies. The resulting merchant quasi-republic was plagued by indecisiveness, preserving the delicate balance of power in the town.
  </p>
  <p key="86b295f9-e0cf-4bfd-b911-6b11fe615bbc">
   The peace guaranteed that the town would survive the Great Winter of 2130.
   The winter brought to the fore a critical problem in the Master's plan: test subject supply. After spring came, he ordered his super mutants to gather human stock from caravans. The situation peaked between 2131 and 2135 as wastelanders blamed the disappearances on deathclaws and monsters in the desert.
   By 2137, the dipping process was perfected and mass production of super mutants starts. The success rate was less than 20%.
  </p>
  <p key="94ea9cec-a3ff-461c-987f-84181a170df5">
   Problems weren't unique to just the mutants. The Brotherhood of Steel, while a formidable force due to their technological advantage, couldn't fight nature. Their founder, Roger Maxson, died of cancer in 2135; his son ascended to the position of high elder, while his grandson became a paladin.
   The Hub had its own cause for concern. In 2140,
   Decker
   formed the
   Underground
   , starting his rule as the criminal lord of the sprawling city.
  </p>
  <p key="090ae8b9-4fd0-4953-9956-677b3c6b0a1b">
   Trouble continued with the mutants. The Master slowly spread his influence through the wastes over the years while building up his army. A crucial piece of the puzzle fell into place in 2152. Upon discovering doomsday cultists led by a man called
   Morpheus
   , the Master decided to use them as spies in the wasteland and the foundations of the
   Children of the Cathedral
   were formed.
   Three years later, in 2155, the Master's forces captured a caravan of vault dwellers from the L.A. Vault. He learned the location of the vault and moved his base of operations there. Learning of other vaults in the area, he realized their occupants were perfect subjects for dipping. The super mutants began to scour the region for the vaults.
   In 2156, the Master established the Children of the Cathedral as a benevolent cult, using Morpheus and his followers to establish outposts and spies in the various wasteland settlements.
   A year later, the Unity finally located a vault. However, it's Vault 12 in the
   <a href="Necropolis.html" key="196f346f-ccb8-44a7-aa1a-1f42b96a6dc0" title="Necropolis">
    Necropolis
   </a>
   . Many ghouls were killed in the assault. Finally,
   Set
   negotiated peace with the super mutants, after explaining that they are indeed the vault dwellers. The recovery operation failed, but the super mutants establish a stronghold in the town to ensure Set's cooperation and watch for humans.
  </p>
  <p key="14b6ae80-c7c3-46b7-91a2-5c0f47194a83">
   The wasteland remained oblivious of the Unity and the Master. The Brotherhood of Steel became an uncontested power in the region after their extermination campaign of 2155 broke the back of the
   Vipers
   . The loss of their high elder to the raiders allowed
   John Maxson
   to assume leadership.
   While the extermination of the Vipers led to full trade relations between the Brotherhood and the Hub, tensions were present. In the 2150s, the Water Merchants of the Hub attempted to barter a large quantity of water for a weapons stockpile. Although the Brotherhood turned down the offer, the merchants attempted to take the weapons regardless. The thieves were caught, but the Brotherhood elders voted down a retaliatory expedition.

   Though shunned by their own people, the destruction of the Unity prevented the super mutants from destroying the fledgling human settlements, with the sole exception of the Necropolis, destroyed days after the Vault Dweller's departure.
   The mutant population dispersed, leading to a migration of the ghouls and the fleeing of super mutants to the east and the north.
   The Vault Dweller traveled with a small group of other dwellers to the north. In the inaccessible canyons in the northwest, they founded

   In the summer of 2185, a former Unity soldier,
   Marcus
   , and a paladin of the Brotherhood,
   Jacob
   , crossed paths. After a firefight and some hand to hand combat, they realize they cannot best one another. With the stalemate obvious, they gave up and befriended each other instead. They traveled together, soon attracting ghouls, humans and other super mutants as they figured that a Unity officer and a paladin are about the safest way to travel.
   In fall that same year, they established the town of
   Broken Hills
   around an abandoned uranium mine, creating a place where humans and human mutants can live side by side.

The ideals of the NCR would spread over the region steadfast, with Junktown becoming one of the first provisional states of the New California Republic, due to its status as one of Shady Sand's oldest and most trusted trade partners. Though the alliance causes some concern in the Hub, ultimately it had little effect on the relations. In 2189, the Republic was voted into existence as a federation of five states:

   She continued to serve ten terms, winning all consecutive elections until her death. As president, Tandi united the wasteland more than any other leader born after the Great War, including rebuilding the pre-War infrastructure to support the growing population, finding new forms of transportation and manufacturing, clearing roads and rail lines, building forts, fostering caravans and trade inside and outside of the republic, as well as dealing with threats swiftly and efficiently.
   By 2241, the republic was the largest economic and political power in the wasteland. Much of its power was provided by its vast brahmin herds, which provide meat, leather, beasts of burden and other goods for trade.
   With the situation south stabilized, President Tandi intended to expand north. However, former northern California became an arena where the NCR struggled to dominate its two rivals:
   Vault City

Whoever controls the supply of gold, controls the currency. Redding was lucky enough to remain far away enough to make a military takeover uneconomic. The three powers instead decided to make the city align with one of them through agents operating in the city, either planted ones (Painless Doc Johnson) or voluntary supporters (Marge LeBarge and Dan McGrew).

Her successors would dramatically change course, leading to a more aggressive foreign policy as the seeds laid by President Tandi yielded fruit, bringing the republic unprecedented prosperity and wealth. The drastic change in the foreign policy came as a result of the massacre of 38 NCR citizens in the
   Bullhead City
   area in
   2253
   , resulting in the removal of
   Joanna Tibbett
   and ascension of Wendell Peterson to the office of president. The deployment of three battalions to the area began an age of expansionism for the republic.
   The deployment at

   in
   2269
   led to the completion of the campaign in
   2270

   General Aaron Kimball
   to the status of a national hero. A year later, in

   Kimball solidified his power base in a number of ways. The most important one was ordering the occupation of the
   Hoover Dam
   as his first act of office in
   2274

   He also enjoyed great popularity among the wealthy, powerful men of the

   and
   Republican Farmer's Committee
   to grow even more powerful, the so-called
   Brahmin Barons
   and
   Agri-Barons
   . The reason for this was simple: Kimball overturned President Tandi's laws limiting the acreage of fields and the number of cattle heads a single man could own. As such, the prosperity and economic development were marred by an ever-increasing influence of the rich at the expense of the common man. However, it led to the development of new economic models. Most importantly, wage labor was reborn and a capitalist, free-market economy began to develop.

   As a result of the Brotherhood of Steel's disagreement with the NCR about how technology should be controlled, a series of violent confrontations took place.
   The NCR attacked and occupied the Brotherhood's fortifications at the
   HELIOS One
   power plant, part of "Operation: Sunburst."
   Despite the efforts to hold the plant, the Brotherhood forces were forced to retreat, suffered a loss of more than half of its paladins and knights, and the disappearance of their leader,

   The NCR consolidated their hold on the location and then set out to pursue any remaining Brotherhood forces, but found none, as the group had retreated to a nearby

   Afterward, the NCR left a small fighting force at the plant, sent the rest sent onward to Hoover Dam, and over the next few years, increased its military presence in the Mojave fivefold.

   With the defeat of the Brotherhood at HELIOS came the illusion of peace. By

   In this weakened state, the NCR Army faced the Legion in 2277. Attacking from the eastern bank of the Colorado River, the slave army challenged the NCR military, assaulting its holdings across the front, with most of the forces focusing on attacking the dam. The

As the government spends much of its budget on "safeguarding" the region, the Mojave failed to produce a single cap in tax revenue. What's worse, the mounting losses in material and manpower (400 up to the Hoover Dam battle, sharply spiking to as much as 1,000 troopers each year afterward)
   effectively made the campaign an enduring, low-intensity political embarrassment for President Kimball and his cabinet. The NCR citizens are increasingly impatient with the lack of progress, as the promises to annex Vegas fail to materialize. However, definite opposition to the Vegas campaign remains a vocal minority. Radical opinions naming the occupation of Vegas as imperialist subjugation of a foreign territory are unpopular and widely considered unpatriotic, except for those that share the view, like the

   The effect of the Great War on the climate also affected wildlife in the area. The
   radioactive fallout
   in the air led to widespread mutation. One mutated species to emerge from this melting pot of genotypes is the
   brahmin
   . This mutated cattle variant is extremely well suited for the harsh conditions of the wasteland, requiring little water and relatively small grazing areas, while providing plenty in return, including milk, meat, leather, bone, transportation et cetera. As such, it rapidly became the most widespread livestock animal in New California and the backbone of many a wasteland economy.

   Other mutated animals that emerged include

Their extremely high breeding rate, brought about by minute FEV influences, led to their widespread adoption by impoverished humans as a source of protein for sustenance. The same is true for mutated species, too, as geckos provide leather, meat and eggs,

   The landscape of the wasteland, as far as politics go, was complex 84 years after the war. The Hub was an oligarchy, ruled by a council comprising two representatives from the three largest caravan companies (the
   Crimson Caravans
   , the
   Far Go Traders
   and the
   Water Merchants

   Other communities throughout the wasteland tended towards meritocracy and a single leader. Such was the case with Shady Sands, Adytum, Necropolis, and other groups of people. Though customs varied, the law was usually enforced by a police force, rather than the entire community, though its size and level of refinement varied by settlement.

   Eighty years later, the political landscape of New California changed immensely. The collapse of the Unity and destruction of raider concentrations allowed the survivor communities to flourish and develop. The largest development was the foundation of the New California Republic in 2186 and the unification of the cities of southern California into a democratic federal republic and the establishment of the rule of law under a constitution and codified laws. This represented a major leap in quality from the isolated, simple communities of the 22nd century.

   The emerging NCR became the dominant political force in the region, but was firmly opposed by two other powers:
   New Reno

   Vault City

It had no laws beyond those enforced by the families for their own benefit and no organized state structures. The latter was a high technology settlement that employed a doctrine best characterized as aristocratic, where the power is concentrated in the hands of the citizens and the laws passed by them serve to protect and support the ruling caste.

  <p key="7ffbd7c5-b0a1-4a6a-a078-d2e1e3d26000">

Caravans carried everything, from water, food, guns, and ammunition, to brahmin, metal scrap and even dirt.
   In fact, these trade caravans would eventually help form the

    2241
   </b>
   By 2241, the economy of New California has blossomed, in no small part thanks to the rise of the New California Republic. Uniting the largest survivor communities of southern California, it was the most powerful and vibrant economy of the region, with much of its power provided by its vast brahmin herds, which provide meat, leather, beasts of burden, and other goods for trade. Although a large portion of the herds was controlled by the
   Stockmen's Association
   and the
   brahmin barons
   ,

   Salvaging was still fairly profitable, though it was mostly handled by large salvage companies in
   New Adytum
   and Hub. Partnerships with
   Dayglow
   ghouls provided the companies with very profitable contracts, especially when the excavation of the Glow began. However, under Tandi's reign, the manufacturing sector and the infrastructure grew tremendously.
   The NCR became a major exporter of mechanical equipment and manufactured goods, exchanging them for what they couldn't produce (such as medical technologies).
   The caravan houses, such as
   Crimson Caravan
   , were one of the biggest factors in the development of the republic.

   and

   These two settlements were the Republic's primary rivals for control over New California. The anarchic Reno, controlled by crime families, was a major exporter and trade hub for alcohol, through guns, to hard drugs, slaves, and prostitutes. Its economy was based primarily on exporting drugs and luxury services, with peace enforced at gunpoint.
  </p>
  <p key="1c50f72a-7c1c-4f90-9993-d19a09fa5e62">
   Vault City was a small, but powerful force. Vault City's advanced medical centers allowed it to produce large quantities of medical goods and technologies they traded with the outside, usually, for raw materials, gold, and other goods it could not produce within city limits,
   although many of their services and goods are prohibitively expensive for most wastelanders.
  </p>
  <p key="aaed915c-ecb5-4717-8f47-78d7706826c3">
   Beyond these three powers, there were scores of smaller settlements dotting the economic landscape of New California. Their economies are typically specialized.
   Klamath
   was a major exporter of leather and leather products thanks to its trappers,
   while
   Modoc
   focused on agricultural exports (and was particularly affected by the drought).
   Broken Hills
   was a mining settlement exporting rare
   uranium ore
   to high tech settlements, such as Vault City. Finally,
   San Francisco
   was an independent center of high technology and fishing.
  </p>
  <p key="a1740b72-3c06-4088-b1d3-a00fa3477910">
   However, the explosive growth of the economy in the region also fueled less savory branches thereof. Although slavery was eradicated in republic territories, in the largely wild, tribe-inhabited north it was a booming trade.
   The Den
   was a settlement whose economy relied on the
   Slaver's Guild
   's business. Slaves were a particularly welcome type of stock, used for menial labor, prostitution, combat and even scientific experiments.

   The economic power of the New California Republic ultimately prevailed and became one of the key factors in the transformation of society between 2241 and 2281. The NCR expanded to incorporate the entire New California territory. The New Californian economy became the

   republic economy. Survival ceased being a major concern for the vast majority of NCR citizens and the problem of collective welfare has been largely superseded by concerns about individual prosperity. People providing services free of charge are now the exception, rather than the rule, with skilled workers routinely charging for their services, from tailors to surgeons. Moreover, after over 80 years of scavenging, the wastelands of New California have been largely picked clean of salvageable goods. NCR citizens who can still make a living exclusively by scavenging and hunting are an uncommon sight. The combination of these cultural and economic factors led to the rebirth of wage labor; most citizens have to seek an employer at a mill, factory or farm and work to earn their keep and earn money necessary to survive,
   but these jobs are easy to find in one of the many mills and farms in New California.

   herds and swaths of land restored to arable condition firmly established it as the greatest economic force in what was the southwest United States. Already influential before, ranchers and farmers now hold even greater sway in the republic. During Tandi's presidency, anti-cartel regulations were enacted to discourage the formation of oligopolies. However, pressure from the
   Stockmen's Association
   and the
   Republican Farmer's Committee
   , ultimately convinced President Kimball to overturn them completely. As a result, since
   2241
   much of the republic's farming and brahmin herding has been monopolized by
   brahmin
   and
   agricultural barons
   , incredibly wealthy individuals who exert a lot of influence thanks to their capital. Their success also led to the emergence of cottage industries, such as the rebirth of luxury goods manufacture and pseudo-journalism reporting on the latest purchases, commissions and life lessons of the newly rich and famous.

   Other branches of industry have also developed. Light industry, including tools, textiles, and other manufacturing, form a significant part of the republic's industrial output. Another element of the republic's economy is its ordnance workshops, producing standardized weapons and armor for the New California Republic Army and Rangers.
   The ever-expanding trade routes led to the rise of powerful merchant houses, such as the
   Crimson Caravan Company
   , the
   Far Go Traders
   and the
   Gun Runners
   , which continue to all but completely dominate all trade within New California.
