   as the two superpowers clashed in a struggle to control the last remaining resources on Earth. The two key participants and their client states and annexed nations engaged in total war against each other, as both civilian and military resources were harnessed to achieve victory over the other side, in a struggle that was as much about resources as it was about ideology. The war was marked by atrocities on both sides, both against foreign and domestic populations, steady escalation of hostilities up to and including the use of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, and gradual transition of both states into totalitarian dictatorships no different from each other.

   Resource shortages made this a war of position, rather than the maneuver. Trench warfare was common, particularly in Alaska, and until new models of
   power armor
   were introduced into the fray by United States forces, stalemates were extremely common.

   The immediate cause of the war was resource shortages. In
   2060
   , available fuel reserves ran out worldwide.
   Traffic on the streets died as fuel became too valuable to waste on automobiles.
   The automotive industry desperately tried to come up with a solution to the problem, but electric and early
   fusion
   cars were too little, too late to help solve the growing needs of society.
   The fuel problem was further emphasized by the collapse of the
   European Commonwealth
   and the
   Middle Eastern
   oil powers, as the oil fields were allegedly exhausted.

   continuing to wreak havoc despite increased quarantine measures.
   The federal government attempted to use the increasing national paranoia to control the situation by discouraging assemblies, fueling the anti-communist sentiment, and encouraging the reporting of subversive elements.
   The
   Vigilant Citizen's Hotline
   was even established to allow hysterical citizens to report neighbors to the government for any behavior that could be construed as in support of communism.
   The Third Red Scare
   unfolded as a response to the increased hostility of the
   People's Republic of China
   and its operations on American soil.
   Research efforts were undertaken that could have alleviated the resource crisis entirely. The

   However, these efforts would lead to Chinese conflict with the United States. As the economy of the communist state was dependent to a much greater degree on fossil fuels than that of the U.S., China found itself on the brink of collapse by the spring of
   2066
   , with oil fields finally drying up globally.
   With the United States unwilling to export its own reserves of crude oil, China had become more aggressive in its negotiations.
   Adding further insult to the world crises, the first crude

   , it was a crude construction. However, its ability to wield heavy weapons with ease greatly increased the firepower and mobility of American troops, allowing them to counter Chinese
   tanks
   and infantry. After the first suits are deployed in January 2067, China rushes to create its own versions but is unable to come up with a counter. The crude nature of the armor only allows for stabilizing the front. The situation devolves into a stalemate rapidly.

   The war effort in Alaska continued to consume ever-increasing amounts of resources.
   With the Chinese occupying and exploiting the resources and infrastructure of Alaska, the United States drew on Canadian resources to support its war effort. Entire stretches of timberland were destroyed as the military consumes Canadian wealth to battle the Chinese across the western front. By 2069, the pressure became unbearable, but Canadian protests went unheard. The entire country slowly became Little America in the minds of U.S. citizens.
   The tensions culminated in a sabotage attempt on the newly-reclaimed Trans-Alaskan Pipeline by Canadian forces.
   Faced with open hostility and rioting in several Canadian cities, the United States responds by beginning the annexation of Canada on June 3, 2072.

   One of the turning points of the war came in
   2074
   , as, despite claims of fighting a defensive war, American infantry and mechanized divisions landed in
   Shantou
   through the Philippines,
   in a counter-invasion of
   China itself
   . The American economy strained as
   American soldiers
   , Marines, sailors, and airmen fought a war on three fronts: Canada, Alaska, and mainland China. Neither side was willing to yield, despite eight years of constant warfare.
   The situation rapidly deteriorated into a stalemate, just like in Alaska.
   Conflicts  also took place in the
   Gobi Desert
   and
   Nanjing
   , while other troops were present in
   Mambajao

   By
   2076
   , the war had raged for a decade. For both soldiers and American citizens alike, the long war caused intense psychological effects, several soldiers returning home with post-traumatic stress disorder.
   Both China and the United States teetered on the brink of collapse, increasing production in an effort to outdo the opponent and cutting experimental project turnarounds in half.
   The annexation of Canada in January bolstered the sagging economy. As American units occupied locations throughout its provinces, martial law was enacted and all protesters were shot on sight.
   The completion of the
   T-51 power armor
   model in June heralded change. After the first batch of T-51 model B units arrived in China, the new series performed exceedingly well against the remaining Chinese tanks, armored vehicles, and infantry. The Chinese rallied and resisted the invasion, even as supply lines began to break down across the board, with nations annexed by China beginning to break down and revolt.
   However, the United States was unable to fully exploit this advantage, as food and energy riots broke out in urban centers across the United States in August. A state of emergency and eventually martial law was declared, with U.S. military forces being deployed on the domestic

   Through a combination of attrition, loss of supply routes, and offensives conducted by the United States across the front, Chinese units in Alaska found themselves surrounded and cut off from reinforcements. The liberation of Anchorage spearheaded by winterized T-51 power armor units under the command of General

   The campaign in mainland China was reinvigorated by the victory in Alaska and the deployment of T-51 units. Army troops clad in T-51 regularly witnessed Chinese troops surrendering upon sighting them and their
   miniguns
   .
   However, the effect did not last. As American troops pushed deeper into the mainland, Chinese resistance increased. By October, the situation transitioned from a rout into a stalemate.
   After a decade of war, there was no end in sight. Billions of dollars and thousands of casualties were spent in vain, despite taxes and various wartime revenues ensuring the United States government has been able to fund a standing army the likes of which the United States has never before seen.
   To bolster the offensive, bases across the United States were sealed and troops redeployed to provide more men for the front lines.

   Potential Chinese subs were identified by the COMPACFLT at 00:03 EST off the coast of California.
