  <p key="3620d16d-edad-494c-9f8f-cec20ea88b0d">
   When asked about the Jackals, Stella points the player character to the junkyard to the east. Seems the Jackals invaded there a while ago, looking for parts to scavenge. Once inside, a Jackal can be found holed up in the shed with ten mole rats outside. After much threatening, the raider says that the Jackals are heading south. They were supposed to pick up some slaves down in Lubbock.
   The player character must also find a gearshift to repair the pink car.

   People have been going missing from both Ghoul Town and the Square with each settlement accusing the other. The ghouls have escalated tensions by staging an attack on the Square. The real cause is the Jackals, who have come from the north to gather slaves.

  <p key="0f6ea947-ab7c-49c3-87e5-a04dd2a461fb">
   The player character can intervene by helping either the ghouls, the humans, or both. Once the true cause of the kidnapping is revealed as the Jackals tensions will be calmed.
   The player character tracks the Jackals down to the airport where they will fight
   Bulldog
   while
   Banshee
   makes a getaway. They will also uncover Banshee's plan to take on Fort Worth, in which he hoped to use the slaves as fodder. The player character can free the slaves for good reputation, or skip town leaving them there resulting in bad reputation.

   . Lone Star is a hotspot with local factions and a place of commerce. Although the various groups remain civil for the most part, they are not beyond hiring those ready to carry out some dirty work. Recently, a strange man came to town bearing seeds, seeds that were planted on the east side and have become a farm. This man remains in the town, and is actually a member of the
   Cyphers
   , but he is incomprehensible to near everyone, so no-one is sure of his business in Lone Star.
   Lone Star consists of four medium maps that make up the town itself, and eight medium maps that make up various "basements." Lone Star is also the home of the old Abilene Vault.

   If the player character has a bad reputation they will be ignored by the
   Lawmen
   , except for the occasional warning, but will be relatively welcomed by the Caesar Raiders and the
   Hand Gang
   who can provide up to three side quests each, these will be related to taking out the local competition.
   With a good reputation the player character can associate with the Lawmen, who will gladly pay for the extermination of the Hand Gang. Also, the
   Ghoul Trading Company
   may ask the player character to deal with the Caesar Raiders, who have been causing some trouble for them.

The base is made up of five medium to large maps containing robot sentries and increasing amounts of plant life towards the boss area. It swiftly becomes a jungle like environment very similar to Vault 39.
   Miles Reese was conducting research into a G.E.C.K.s capabilities that he had stolen from the Nursery, in order to protect his base, located in the Corpse. However, over five years, the G.E.C.K. began to terraform on a dangerous scale, including within enclosed structures, and occasionally produced carnivorous plants.

   It could generate unnatural weather patterns and his experiments created jungles within deserts, and areas previously covered by water re-flooded on an even larger scale. As Miles continued to tinker with the G.E.C.K., its capabilities became sharpened. He worked to focus its power on the specific task of covering the Corpse with a protective, organic shell.

   is a jungle in southern Texas, which Miles Reese hoped to eventually expand across the globe. Miles Reese was a radical Cypher, who longed to rid the world of technology, and return the planet to nature. In his research, he learned of the Nursery, and the prototype Garden of Eden Creation Kit that was housed there. After traveling to the facility and retrieving the prototype, he journeyed to the Gulf of Mexico and set up a base in The Corpse. There he began to experiment with and modify the G.E.C.K., creating a large jungle. The Forced Evolutionary Virus in the environment affected the plant life, creating mutated, carnivorous plants.

  <p key="a7f95c03-5fac-450f-866c-85cfc89fbaee">
   It took Miles five years to finish his work. He intended to fully activate his "New Eden device" after destroying the Texas chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel, covering the world in greenery and killing all humans. The player character breaks into the base and overloads the G.E.C.K., killing him before he can carry out his plan.
