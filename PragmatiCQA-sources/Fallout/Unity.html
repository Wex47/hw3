   The Unity began with the ill-fated expedition to
   <a href="Mariposa Military Base.html" key="63b643e8-dbf6-47bf-a37d-d41a134183ec" title="Mariposa Military Base">
    Mariposa Military Base

   , undertaken by
   Harold
   ,
   Richard Grey
   , and a group of other adventurers in
   2102
   . On June 23, the party was routed by mutants inhabiting the base. Grey was knocked into one of the Vats. His wounded state combined with extreme long-term exposure to the FEV precipitated his evolution into the Master.
   After he regained consciousness and dragged himself from the Vats, he continued to mutate after the weeks-long immersion.
   The mutation eventually stabilized enough for him to notice his greatly increased mental capacity, capable of resolving the most complex of philosophical questions. He began experimenting on animals infesting the military base by exposing them to the Virus. When he dipped a rat and a dog into the Virus at the same time, the resulting fusion inspired him to begin formulating a philosophy of unification, laying the groundwork for the Unity.
   However, experiments were frustrated by a lack of subjects or understanding of the virus.
  </p>
  <p key="4363abb6-f5eb-4d54-a64b-2ba6424aa9f3">
   In December 2102, following a series of directed mutations by injecting doses of the virus into various areas of his mutated body, Grey gained the ability to neurolink with computers, allowing him to access the base's databanks. Aided by the data, he began experiments on humans who strayed into the facilities, without much luck.
   Finally, in
   January 2103
   , he finally isolated radiation exposure as the crucial factor affecting transformation success. The first successful super mutant was assimilated by Grey as a fellow mind, creating the
   <a href="Master.html" key="a4237688-2b59-49c9-a6de-800d227c7087" title="Master">

   hive mind. The Unity began in earnest.
   as the Master began to gather test subjects from local human communities. The process was slow, hampered by their scarcity, but over the next thirty years he built up a small force of super mutants until the Great Winter of 2130 convinced the Master that it is no longer feasible.
  </p>
  <p key="7109253d-70e1-4f28-8b3b-5abc4fac2ba7">
   In
   2131
   , the Master decided to focus on acquiring subjects from caravans that crossed the wasteland in ever increasing numbers. The human settlements were blissfully unaware of the raids, blaming them on monsters, allowing the army to grow tremendously.
   By
   2137
   , there were enough super mutants to sustain mass production. While the success rate was between 15-20%, with a half going on to join the Master's army, it grew rapidly into a potent military force. The resulting army was named Unity by the Master, becoming the foundation of his vision for humanity and the world.
   For the next fifteen years, the Unity would expand over
   New California
   , striking for the shadows. In
   2152
   , the Master enlisted the aid of
   Morpheus
   and his doomsday cultists, creating the
   Children of the Cathedral
   to act as the Unity's public face and maintain secrecy.

  <p key="9214a04c-2f02-43ca-a923-c67b1ab69547">
   Just three years later, in
   2155
   , the Unity experienced a breakthrough in its operations. After apprehending a caravan of

   dwellers from the
   Los Angeles Vault
   , the Master transferred his command there and ordered Morpheus' cultists to renovate the building above the Vault, establishing the
   Cathedral
   and its
   Children
   . The Vault provided a wealth of information to the Master and the Unity, most importantly the locations of other
   <a href="Vault.html" key="919429f6-6d9f-4e89-990c-96c7aab45659" title="Vault">
    Vaults

   . Super mutants began searching their suspected locations, gathering prime subjects for
   super mutant
   conversion.
   Not all operations were successful: The detachment sent to investigate Bakersfield and
   <a href="Vault 12.html" key="12661874-d795-4e5b-aeb9-b36a7bd1ad79" title="Vault 12">

   wound up engaging the
   ghouls
   living among the ruins, with fighting only ceasing when
   Set
   brokered a ceasefire, explaining that the ghouls

   The steady expansion of Unity operations and preparation for the attack on
   New California
   , spearheaded by the
   Children of the Cathedral
   seemed impossible to prevent. However, the Master did not account for the

   March 3, 2162

   Although the Vault Dweller disappeared into the wasteland, the

   picked up where they left off, driving the super mutants away with minimal loss of life, on both sides of the conflict, and establishing itself as a major power in the wasteland, but wisely remaining out of the power structure.
  </p>
  <p key="cdeb388b-1a67-46cf-a5b2-0795b393aa09">
   Surviving super mutants split into several different groups, each pursuing a different goal: Many groups migrated away from New California, north and east, looking for new places to settle.
   Some settled in the Mojave, first at Black Mountain and later in the settlement of Jacobstown. A large group journeyed into the Rockies,
   <span key="69b1b649-d325-4543-aff5-7a6a58bb3343" style="color:dimgray">
    eventually reaching as far as
    Illinois

    .
   </span>
  </p>
  <p key="14e0e3ba-a594-4e59-803f-cfe050b9f250">
   Some settled down to coexist with humans to attempt to integrate into society or find a new life for themselves, with one of the most notable attempts being
   Broken Hills
   , founded by
   Marcus
   and
   Jacob
   in 2185, as a place where regular and mutated humans could live side by side.
   Eventually, together with
   ghouls
   , the mutant population would become large enough to become a distinct population group in the
   New California Republic
   , which would pass laws prohibiting discrimination based on a mutation in
   2205
   .
  </p>
  <p key="b7f194ea-0006-4375-bfab-daf195a241e2">
   Not all super mutants would adapt to the new situation. Some took to the desert, refusing to lay down their weapons and surrender. The die-hard remnants of the Master's armies would continue to plague northern New California and the Mojave, contributing to lingering prejudice against mutants. Even as late as
   2281
   , some mutants would fall prey to the prejudices of man, such as
   Mean Sonofabitch
   , tortured and maimed by a group of bigots.
   Some politicians even seek to capitalize on the anti-mutant sentiment for the benefit of their political career.

  <p key="db1fa239-8405-482e-900f-9cba67374c72">
   The Unity was an egalitarian society. The Virus elevated all super mutants to a common level of physical aptitude, eliminating many of the differences that lay at the heart of the inter-human conflict. Many super mutants actually preferred the transformation, as the Unity was free of pettiness, hatred, and jealousy that plagued regular mankind. The only problems were one with intelligence, as some candidates for transformation did not have the mental fortitude necessary to withstand the strain.
   While they were a minority among the mutants (most retained their pre-dipping intellect), their impact was severe enough to interfere with the Unity's goals.
  </p>
  <p key="41d336d6-afba-4ee7-b87b-e311ea67e593">
   Most mutants didn't hate humans, instead believing theirs to be the better way. Humanity's reluctance to overcome its inherent problems meant that most had to be forced to change and adapt, as they would run when they heard the call, rather than embracing it.
   If humans embraced the call, the Master's plan would never be required in the first place, after all.
   There were differing beliefs, of course: Some super mutants viewed themselves as equals to normal humans, owing to their common ancestry. They viewed the mutation as merely a rebirth - and supported the Unity, believing it to be the best chance for peace, despite misgivings.
  </p>
  <p key="0c8d7612-c417-4d53-b214-036f964f9e30">
   However, human converts drawn from the
   Children of the Cathedral
   made for poor conversation partners, due to their religious fervor (genuine or staged). FEV was commonly referred to as the Blood of God, the restraints used to prepare humans for dipping were holy, while the Vats were the womb where the armies of god were created.
   Despite that, honesty and trust prevailed between the mutants and even their human charges, even when it came to critical matters.
   Joint meditation sessions between super mutants and normal human faithful from the Cathedral were common as well, even if they reinforced the religious side of the Unity.
  </p>
  <p key="2d433f10-8d68-4243-9df1-d537948363ba">
   There was one critical flaw in the Unity's perfect society: Even if the Master
   <i key="0ad9041d-893e-44a6-85d4-27f3f30109aa">
    did
   </i>
   succeed, the Unity would fail, as the FEV rendered the super mutants sterile and the Unity would bring about the final end of humanity. While it did not damage primary sexual characteristics, allowing super mutants to have intercourse, it did interfere with gametes, correcting the DNA within. As a result, conception was impossible.

   The Unity was originally coined by the Master in 2102, referring to his ability to assimilate living creatures into himself. In fact, he was apparently planning to assimilate the "wonderful variety of life" into a single, unified biomass in these stages.
   However, this idea was abandoned entirely by 2137, when the Unity came into existence as a military force focusing on advancing the Master's philosophy and vision for mankind.
  </p>
  <p key="33e7ca0f-ddb0-4f9e-a43a-e2ae43b8caba">
   Said vision eventually evolved to focus on figurative unification. The Unity would eliminate differences between humans and the resulting strife and war by uplifting: Exposure to the

   . The resulting super mutants would not only be unified but capable of thriving in the wasteland as one race and one people, united behind a single goal. Neither ghouls nor normal humans were seen as competitive, the former being victims of the nuclear death brought upon mankind by the latter.
   To become a super mutant was to reach the next step in human evolution - and save the world in the process.
  </p>
  <p key="61016c87-e2c8-408e-81de-3f0e72485dd6">
   All worthy humans would be converted by FEV, becoming the perfect human specimens in the process.
   Faster, stronger, more intelligent, and immune to disease or radiation, prepared for living in the ash-covered world. Sacrificing choice in the matter was deemed an acceptable trade-off for the ability to live without fear.
   All the worthy individuals would undergo the conversion - regardless of their opinion on the matter.
   Those who did not qualify would be permitted to live out their lives under Unity control and protection but deprived of the ability to perpetuate their species.

   The Unity was a highly militarized society and there was no clear distinction between soldiers or civilians, leading to it being commonly called the Master's army. The super mutants were uniformly strong, resilient, and immune to the hazards of the wasteland, and received training in the use of weapons and tactics. The
   Children of the Cathedral
   were the closest to a typical civilian, but even they were expected to participate in the conquest of New California as irregulars and support units for the Master's soldiers.
