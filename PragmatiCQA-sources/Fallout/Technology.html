   Researchers arrived at two solutions: utilizing fission and fusion as the primary power sources. The first crude fusion cell was unveiled in

   providing the United States with an edge and averting its imminent bankruptcy.

   By 2077, cold-fusion such as
   microfusion cells
   were commonplace and used widely as chargers for energy-consuming technology, ranging from
   laser rifles
   to
   cars
   , with further innovation presented in the form of the
   microfusion breeder
   utilized in the
   recharger rifle
   and
   pistol
   . Another representative element of the new energy source is the iconic
   T-51 power armor
   , powered by a back-mounted TX-28 microfusion pack, with enough fuel capacity to allow operation for nearly a century.
   Another source of energy was the
   fusion core
   , used in
   power armor frames
   , fusion generators and
   Gatling lasers
   . Before the bombs dropped, Mass Fusion developed the
   Beryllium agitator
   for large scale clean nuclear energy.

   In 2077, due to the oil crisis, petroleum was no longer a widely available fuel, even more so with the excellent power the automobiles had, though the wealthy still drove gasoline-powered cars,
   as well as companies providing gasoline and diesel fuel across America.
   Many car companies had desperately pursued research into alternative power sources, with
   Chryslus Motors
   finally patenting the successor to gasoline: electric engines, powered by energy cells.
   Charged with fusion cells, a Chryslus Corvega or Highwayman featured 800+ horsepower and acceleration from 0 to 60 mph in under a second, all done with a fully analog system and no computers.
   However, not many of these cars were produced and those that were had limited success due to their hefty price tag ($199,999.99 for a Corvega).

   The most closely-guarded secret of
   the Institute
   , the molecular relay allows for teleportation and operates via the
   classical radio
   station. It is known to cause strong interference across all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, and this interference can be identified and followed by listening to the radio it operates over.
   Institute
   coursers
   have a direct connection to the relay with
   special hardware
   that is embedded within their head.
