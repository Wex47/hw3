   Death does not result in loss of progression; instead, the player will merely drop all the junk on-hand. Players can retrieve their junk left behind in a bag, indicated by a map icon, and other players may steal it. On occasion, the player will be downed instead of being killed right away, in which case another player can use a stimpak to revive them. Like previous

   Initially, food and drinks were important to help survive as starving would result in continual HP damage while being dehydrated would limit the maximum AP.

   are found throughout Appalachia, and each one has their own distinctive piece of furniture, which can be placed at a C.A.M.P. Only one ally can be active at any given time. Although most allies may only assign daily quests,

   and
   Beckett
   are unique in that they offer their own narrative questlines. Additionally, allies may offer unique temporary bonuses; for example, speaking with Maul temporarily raises

  <p key="1dc445c1-327d-409c-831f-e23d2b8655f5">
   Players have to spend a varying number of points on cards, dependent on the initial value. Cards of the same type can be combined with an additional point cost to create a higher ranked version of that initial card, max rank depends on the card. The value of the card is shown in the upper left corner. Players gain a SPECIAL point on level up until level 50 which they can assign to a SPECIAL stat of their choosing. After level 50, players are still able to pick a perk card but no longer receive SPECIAL points. From level 25 onward,
   punch card machines
   can be utilized for different
   SPECIAL Loadouts
   . They allow for easy (re-)distribution of SPECIAL points for loadouts, and also for changing the currently active loadout.

   On top of players assigning cards to their character to enhance their own build, there are also cards available to enhance the current statistics of their team as a whole, most of which fall under Charisma. There are few solo-player Charisma cards, as the majority are designed for team play. Another way players can support their team is by sharing perk cards. Players can only share one perk card, the rank of the card they can share is based on the Charisma SPECIAL stat. For every three points of Charisma, one perk card point can be shared.

  <p key="6aaf3cb9-264f-42ea-86b3-aa0c5be4a69b">
   Initially, players receive a Perk Card Pack every two levels up to level ten. This is a random selection of four cards that the player can swap out with their current cards. After level ten, players receive the card packs every five levels. These packs can occasionally include a card that is higher in value than normal, increasing a stat or ability more than it would otherwise. There are hundreds of cards available.

Most challenges are tied to the account rather than a created character; for example, collecting 760 wood only grants Atoms once, collecting the same amount with another character does nothing. However, this also means that progression can be shared between characters; for example, a player could collect 500 wood with one character and 260 wood with another in order to obtain the Atoms for the challenge.
Completing a scoreboard will net the player 500 Atoms, and additional 100 Atoms for each 10th rank after rank 100.

   was tailored to only handle one player, the developers experienced difficulties modifying the engine to handle multiple players. Whether or not the game should have human non-player characters was a large debate in the developer team.
   The developers agreed on a consensus to try an experimental approach in which other players took the role of non-player characters.

   According to
   Marc Tardif
   in June 2019, content containing living human characters was initially "not even on [the] radar" for Bethesda, and community feedback was the driving force behind the development of the update.
   However, lead designer
   Ferret Baudoin
   stated in August 2020 that, from the beginning of development, some developers disagreed with the idea of excluding human NPCs in the base game. Despite this, there were a number of logistical issues that prevented human NPCs from appearing at launch, as it would have further complicated an already difficult technical process. Baudoin said that it was actually on the radar "from a very early point."

   <i key="769c6695-2ccb-4cd7-9ecd-ab855d2b6cf6">
    "There are many things to like. In addition to playing with friends, there's plentiful loot, the beautiful Appalachian countryside, and no shortage of points of interest. However, there are also just as many things to dislike, including the complete lack of storage both on your person and in your cache, the luck-of-the-draw perk system, and how the level scaling works in for pretty much everything."

   <i key="07895d73-6f86-4af1-b480-2d22aa20c8ba">
    "By now this shouldn’t be news to anyone, but: a new Fallout game has bugs. Yet even by the notorious standards of a Bethesda open-world game, Fallout 76 is technically shaky."

  </p>
  <p key="c949ce74-5af8-47ec-a028-0200a01ad2a5">
   The lack of living human NPCs and moral decision making was a common complaint. GameStop's review felt,
   <i key="6e2f8f21-98e2-4590-8335-cc737419b97d">
    "The lack of inhabitants is also Fallout 76's biggest problem. The game goes to great efforts to paint a picture that includes towns and cities with different populations and cultures, survivors who have banded together to form factions, and stories of people who managed to survive against all odds. But without having any of those people present to tell their stories personally, 76's world is limited to being little more than just an environmental exhibit with things to kill."
