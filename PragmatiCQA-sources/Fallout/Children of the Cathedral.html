   Members of the Children were united by a general belief in the Holy Flame and its endless quest to heal the land and the people.

   Initiates would be expected to spend several weeks of meditation and fasting, before approaching an elder for acceptance into the ranks of the faithful. Alternatively, a prospective Child could volunteer to an elder for service work, including healing the sick, feeding the hungry, and teaching the young.
   Accepted members were expected to keep their minds healthy and pure. To achieve this, the Cathedral proscribed alcohol and drug use.
   In return for their service and discipline, the Cathedral would provide for all of their needs.

   Morpheus

   and numerous thugs used by the Cathedral as soldiers.
   On the other were people like
   Thorndyke

   Acolytes who proved their loyalty to the Cathedral could become Servitors. Once their indoctrination was completed, they would be brought to the Inner Sanctum and subjected to drug injections and torture. The procedure was meant to push their minds to the breaking point. Those who survived it with their psyche intact would be granted the appropriate rank and purple robes as a badge of their station.
   Those who did not were retained as laborers and soldiers, after filling their broken minds with Cathedral dogma. These "zombies" were a particularly common sight around the Cathedral.

   The Cathedral granted a lot of freedom in the interpretation of its core tenets, with most High Priests developing their own doctrine based on the core tenets.
   Morpheus
   ' sermons focused on the Children's role as messengers of evolution and healers of the land and its people, emphasizing the search for Unity: A higher level of life without hardship and strife, unity with fellow humans and mutants.
   The ultimate goal of all Children is to bring this unity into existence and subsequently achieve peace on Earth, by implementing the

   Other High Priests represented a more practical approach in their doctrine. Elder
   Jain
   , head of the
   Hub hospital
   , echoed Morpheus' doctrine while offering a concrete road to this higher life. A life of contentment and fulfillment could be attained by working for future generations,  rebuilding the planet and making it a better place for those who come after.
   Perseverance in the face of adversity was key. Jain proposed that the Children could accomplish anything through persistence and effort - military if need be. While a peaceful solution was preferable, bringing others into the fold without violence, those who resist would be subjected to militant crusades aimed at destroying them as an obstacle to the Children's cause.

   On the other end of the spectrum, Father
   Lasher
   focused on personal development, rather than service. The mutation was a non-factor: Every birth is a mutation of parents' DNA, everyone is a mutant: What matters is that they are guided on a moral and productive path.
   Moral progress could be achieved through pain, the most instructive force in the universe. The faithful were to be broken and then remade into tools of the Master's will.
   Enduring pain purified the mind and prevented decadence and ease, fostering evolution necessary for survival in the harsh wasteland.
   Those who succumb to pain and expire were a necessary sacrifice.

  <p key="1776f960-9194-42d9-a07d-66e80ce75bd8">
   Lasher's philosophy did not focus on simple endurance of physical pain. Righteousness was also attained through struggle, trauma, and recovery until one accepted the Master's truth without hesitation.
   Achieving that state was rewarded with consecration. Beyond that lay

   , the ultimate honor, achieved by perfecting oneself through the endurance of pain, by the acquisition of wisdom, and the performance of service: Pain is knowledge, Wisdom is obedience, and Service is courage. In the end, one rejected the Light that destroyed humanity and pledged themselves to the Darkness in which all are equal.

   Beyond the extremes of pacifism, militancy, and enlightenment through suffering, there were also moderate positions within the Cathedral.
   Sister Viola
   is a philosopher, who formulated a utilitarian philosophy. She accepted the Apocalypse as a fait accompli, one that was the result of a dissolute, fragmented world that rejected peace and unity. She believed the Children represented the only viable option at creating a unified world in a
   <a href="New California.html" key="282a8fd4-1730-4346-a4fb-0ca5f1265c18" title="New California">

   </a>
   divided between isolated, conflicted factions. It was a conclusion drawn from the facts: The Followers and the Brotherhood were content to sit on the sidelines, the Hub was fraught with oligarchical strife, while the Boneyard was a stretch of ruins torn apart by tribal gangs.
   While she applauded efforts by adventurers and local militias to root out monsters and brigands, she believed that a concerted effort on a larger scale was necessary. Children would bring order to the chaotic wasteland, ensuring its survival and preventing monsters from hurting humanity again. They would purge selfishness from human hearts, the same madness that drove humanity to unleash Apocalypse on itself, allowing all to work for the common good.
  </p>
  <p key="340634fc-8ed2-45c0-a5cf-a09d54aec9b1">
   The able would be elevated to positions where they could help the community,
   working as part of an ordered society that would allow all to excel in the role best suited for them: Drone, soldier, or queen.
  </p>
  <p key="d10d097c-3b16-43e4-80cb-05c580c4f462">
   The physical conquest of the wasteland was a necessary sacrifice if the end result was a united world. As imperfect as it would inevitably be, she argued, it would have a better chance of holding itself together than the dissolute New California of the 22nd century,
   which would continue to develop into packs of powerful enclaves, eventually powerful enough to start Apocalypse all over again.
   Therefore, the Unity was a necessary defense of humanity from self-destruction, not dissimilar to the actions of self-proclaimed heroes
   <a href="Vault Dweller.html" key="625415ff-3e5f-49cb-9d59-7cc7499a4028" title="Vault Dweller">

  <p key="8a753f3c-7241-47b4-9c06-c53a8af8a7a8">
   At the same time, she did not believe that violence was ethical. Its only justification lay in the absence of superior methods to achieve the goals of the Cathedral.
   By extension, the Master's actions, could be accepted as, from her perspective, the only viable way to unify New California. Even the apparent genocide could actually be salvation in disguise, especially if its threat would ensure the people's cooperation and even eventual revelation of safer, less morally corrosive ways to achieve the Unity's goals.

  <p key="1b74ca48-caf1-4064-8d9a-b972140101bb">
   The capstone of her philosophy was something she regarded as the paradox of peace: No struggle comes without a price, and the greatest struggle inevitably enacts the greatest cost.
   This struggle was an obligation, to yourself and your children, an obligation to improve your life. Abdicating that responsibility, citing the sorry state of the world, was cowardice.

   The most noticeable effort of the Children was a network of hospitals set up in settlements across the wasteland, offering hope and some of the best medical care in the wasteland at a fraction of the usual cost.
   Their services were popular among the wastelanders, particularly when they matched the care quality of local practices at a significantly lower cost. For example,
