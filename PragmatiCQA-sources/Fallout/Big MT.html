   The Big MT Research and Development Center was originally built inside a cave system running underneath a large mountain peak that gave it its name.
   The goal of the facility was to build the future of mankind and create the technology of tomorrow without restraints, either moral or technical. It welcomed some of the most gifted pre-War scientists, who plumbed the depths of many experimental technological fields.
   The research conducted within was as groundbreaking as it was unethical, conducted in part on living humans (both American volunteers and Chinese-American detainees). Big MT even included a
   concentration camp
   of its very own, safeguarded by lucrative contracts with the
   <a href="United States Army.html" key="db827174-2806-467a-921b-8b9971a16a3a" title="United States Army">
    US Army
   </a>
   .
   However, due to budget cuts in the later years of its operation, Big MT had to improvise alternate means of funding and research. The executives began to strike deals with third parties, exchanging experimental technology for money and other privileges. Due to budget cuts, they even began assassinating non-military targets (
   Project Hare
   ) to procure research subjects, and exhuming buried US citizens (
   Project Burke
   ) to procure test subjects.
  </p>
  <p key="052fb615-e0ef-486f-82c3-f83ed2c154fa">
   Due to a failed experiment conducted by the future Doctor
   Klein
   in the
   Y-0 research center
   , the mountain above the center was vaporized, leaving behind a giant crater and exposing the facility.
   This catastrophe did not faze the researchers, and the efforts in pushing the boundaries of science continued unabated. The new land exposed by the explosion was adapted for scientific purposes: new facilities were established, both above- and below-ground, including
   an artillery test field
   and
   a test town
   .
  </p>
  <p key="6d476802-22f3-4de9-8ca6-3db0cb852d0a">
   The facility was under the guidance of its six gifted executives,
   0
   ,
   8
   ,
   Borous
   ,
   Dala
   ,
   Mobius
   , and the administrator,
   Klein
   (their original names unknown
   ) known together as the
   Think Tank
   . The facility gave birth to new technologies, such as the
   Saturnite
   alloy, next-generation
   hazmat suits
   , new models of
   cyberdogs
   ,
   advanced stealth suits
   ,
   holograms
   , and many more. At the same time, many new horrors were also born in the laboratories of the Big MT:
   cazadores
   ,
   night stalkers
   ,
   mutagenic plants
   ,
   ambulatory corpses
   ,
   previously unknown toxins
   , and other fearsome creations. Both types were sold to private parties in exchange for certain favors:
   Frederick Sinclair
   obtained various experimental technologies (including even the prototype
   matter conversion machines
   ) in return for allowing Big MT to use the
   <a href="Sierra Madre.html" key="9f08557d-36f2-4d5b-a131-ca8a6fee53b9" title="Sierra Madre">
    Sierra Madre
   </a>
   as a proving grounds,
   a decision that backfired catastrophically when the experimental technologies turned on the casino inhabitants, dooming them. Such an event was not unprecedented either, as the town of
   Hopeville
   was wiped off the map by a disastrous meteorological experiment in another such exchange, and later became
   the Divide
   .
  </p>
  <p key="e559213d-ef85-45d5-aa18-c8bbf4dd1079">
   The scientists' cooperation wasn't entirely frictionless. During one particularly heated dispute with Doctor Mobius, Doctor Klein threw
   the Sink
   's personality chips off the dome's balcony. The Big MT staff picked up the various holotape chips and stored them in existing facilities, and that of the Sink Central Intelligence Unit was personally recovered by the future Doctor Klein.

  <p key="c757489a-2ce8-4113-a8ed-7e44b3271889">
   When the Great War came, it did not stop the research efforts; it merely put them on a different rail. Mobius worked on predicting the post-holocaust economic systems. A new project was also started, with the purpose of preserving the Big MT "Think Tank" executives by transforming them into a special brain bot named
   after their group
   , allowing them to continue their work at Big MT indefinitely. With no one to stand in the way, their research continued, becoming more sinister and debauched as the years went by.
  </p>
  <p key="6389f1ec-9065-4d87-928e-51321f9fe9bd">
   Eventually, the remaining human staff dispersed into the wasteland or were killed off by increasingly out-of-control experiments; like the escape of the cazadores and night stalkers. Only the six
   think tanks
   remained in the Big MT.
   Mobius
   , tired of the think tank's endless and horrible experimentation, thinking that "the world isn't ready for that kind of too-far-thing-taking" or believing his fellow scientists had finally lost what remained of their humanity, erected a
   radar fence
   - a kind of radar-guided repulsive field - around the perimeter of Big MT to prevent the disembodied brains from escaping into the wasteland, and destroying what little remained of humanity with his colleagues' planned experimentation on a new "fertile testing ground."
  </p>
  <p key="a485a632-f05e-4bdd-bcfa-c9886460fda8">
   After a severe dispute with Klein, Mobius hacked his colleagues' shells, causing them to forget large portions of their personality and substituting their name with a new one, reinforcing the recursion loop already programmed before. Furthermore, he hacked the databanks of his colleagues, reprogramming their chronometers, geometers and cartography programs, essentially erasing their sense of time and history. He also forged several facts to focus the Think Tank's attention on himself: that his robo-scorpions consume intelligence from brains (creating the fear to go outside the central Big MT's dome), that he was exiled for crimes too heinous to remain in recorded memory, and a belief that Big MT is all that remains of the world, that nothing exists outside. In the end, his tampering created mangled, disjointed versions of his former colleagues. Disgusted by his actions against his friends, he erased some parts of his own memory to ease his conscience, such as this event (though not permanently, as certain phrases could reawaken the memories) and knowledge of his pre-War creation, the robo-scorpion.
  </p>
  <p key="129e82d4-4ec4-45cc-9ed2-2ba973b01f60">
   Soon after, Mobius removed himself to the X-42 robo-warfare facility (renamed the "Forbidden Zone"), where he began to "re-create" the robo-scorpion, inspired by radscorpions wandering into Big MT. His new creation retained all features of the pre-War model: a tail-mounted energy bolt blaster, eyes systems allowing him to see through them, remote control and public address systems allowing him to monitor the Big MT. Fearing that the radar fence would not be sufficient to hold the mad scientists inside the crater, he set up a repeating threat message to be broadcasted to the Think Tank. The aim was to instill fear and prompt them to focus on retrieving technologies that would allow them to depose Mobius. When Big MT finally fell silent, it became the arena of an increasingly demented, insane struggle between
   Mobius
   and the
   Think Tank
   . The latter remained inside the dome, ever fearful of their self-appointed warden and his scorpions.
  </p>
  <p key="d4fbf396-dd37-439d-a7b1-15f778294cd4">
   Big MT had few visitors, the sheer size of the crater serving as its best camouflage: most wastelanders assumed the ragged edges to be remnants of a massive nuclear explosion and avoided it altogether. The unfortunate few who wandered in disappeared forever, apprehended by robots and lobotomized by the think tanks to act as organic automata, maintaining the decaying facility or protecting it against scavengers.
  </p>
  <p key="93463216-8f33-4747-9352-f299bb2be5d6">
   Over the years, it became known in the wasteland as the "Big Empty," a place where nothing exists. Its size and aura of mystery blocked the establishment of trade routes and reliable supply caravans between the

   New Vegas

   Caesar's Legion

   First Battle of Hoover Dam

   was unable to reinforce its army quickly enough.

   Even though the facility's security was almost perfect, three people were able to elude the
   think tanks
   and survive the horrors intended for them, before the
   Courier
   arrived:
   Elijah
   ,
   Ulysses
   and
   Christine Royce
   .
  </p>
  <p key="62cd335a-908e-49a7-8537-6007ed0babcf">
   Elijah came to the Big Empty in search of weapons that would allow him to destroy the
   NCR
   and everyone who would oppose him in the creation of a new Brotherhood of Steel order. Elijah scoured the facility for technologies that would be of use to him in his endeavor. Namely, after learning of the
   <a href="Sierra Madre.html" key="8b207562-56d2-4046-ac5e-a82cadc490de" title="Sierra Madre">
    Sierra Madre

   from Ulysses, he started gathering equipment that would allow him to crack the casino. He took an unusable
   holorifle
   prototype,
   perfected afterward thanks to the holograms of the Sierra Madre.
  </p>
  <p key="8fdda025-80c3-48d0-a388-ba139c73d09f">
   Ulysses came to Big MT by accident, having been following weather patterns from the Divide, recognising that storms that violent were man made, not natural.
   Christine Royce pursued Elijah, tasked with killing him for the crimes committed against the
   <a href="Brotherhood of Steel.html" key="9d5ee131-f4eb-4559-ae54-03f95e8cf085" title="Brotherhood of Steel">

   .
  </p>
  <p key="78d96def-22a0-4e60-942a-c601c3410130">
   Of the three, Christine was the only one who did not escape unscathed. Captured by Big MT robots following a disastrous skirmish at
   Little Yangtze
   and pitted against Elijah who sent the survivors of Little Yangtze against her like walking bombs, she was subjected to horrific experiments in the
   Y-17 medical facility
   conducted by some
   Mister Orderly
   and
   Y-17 trauma override harnesses
   and with a Mark IX Auto-Doc. These experiments permanently damaged her brain, destroying her ability to read and write fluently. She was saved from certain death by
   Ulysses
   , who destroyed the entities and nursed her back to health in his
   camp
   in Big MT. Afterward, he talked to her about philosophy and his desire to go into the
   central dome
   and speak with the Think Tank.
  </p>
  <p key="594e7851-5378-4ae0-8c92-040340ac9dc4">
   At some point, Elijah spoke with the Think Tank, which caused the Think Tank doctors to begin questioning their ideas regarding the world. The Think Tank began to doubt that their world was as small as they had perceived, bringing new ideas to their minds. After Ulysses and Elijah made contact, at which point Ulysses directed him to the Sierra Madre, Ulysses too spoke with the Think Tank, particularly Dr. Klein, who asked a lot about history. Ulysses asked a dangerous question: "Who are you, that do not know your history?" After Ulysses showed them the Old World flag, the Think Tank eventually remembered many past events, especially that there is a world outside the Big Empty, a world with ideas and possibilities for experimentation. Dr. Klein regarded the question as too dangerous, and, as it reminded him of too many past events, he subsequently deleted it from his memory. After coaxing the answers he wanted out, Ulysses returned to his camp to say farewell and pass on information to Christine about Elijah, and he left Big MT to travel onward to the Divide.
  </p>
  <p key="f37f5fc3-0ab1-4575-a32a-5963aca51e6b">
   Elijah was the only one who left the Think Tank a parting gift. After being apprehended by
   Dr. 0
   and Dr.
   8
   , he hacked them both within minutes, permanently damaging 8's voice module and leaving destruction in his wake. He left Big MT on a cargo train, and then crashed the remaining trains in tunnels leading out of the facility. During these events, Mobius observed, even the conversation of Ulysses and Elijah with the Think Tank, rendered the inability to act on anything, and his fears grew surrounding the future actions of the Think Tank.
  </p>
  <p key="c7cb69b9-0bac-43e2-9765-15ceb4eb2bd0">
   Sometime after the three left permanently, the Think Tank installed a pacification field in the Think Tank central area, preventing anyone without a brain to have hostile impulses. Afterward, to see if there really was something outside of Big MT, they sent a satellite prototype with a unique charge of teleportation outside of Big MT which crashed in the
   Mojave Drive-in
   in the
   Mojave Wasteland
   . It emitted a signal in the form of a jazz theme named
   mysterious broadcast
   that led to it. The
   Courier
   arrived, just after having been guided by the signal, inspected the satellite during the night and triggered the unique teleporter onboard the satellite, transporting themself to the Big MT.
  </p>
  <p key="877d45e8-6065-4396-ac03-9873536acd7d">
   Afterward, the Courier was taken to the Sink in preparation to become a
   lobotomite
   ; but due to the gunshot wound from
   Benny
   causing a cranial injury in just the right place, it was enough for the
   Sink Auto-Doc
   to change its programming to fix the problem, improving the cranial extraction procedure. However, in the process, it was necessary to replace the spine and heart with synthetic organs. With the
   Courier's brain
   procedural data, the Think Tank would be granted the knowledge to modify their cranial selves into hosts to slip past the radar fence and leave Big MT. However, after the Think Tank extracted it, they degraded into bickering amongst themselves. Mobius saw an opportunity to steal the Courier's brain with its knowledge and led it into the "Forbidden Zone." Wanting to escape with the brain intact, the Courier was obliged to help the Think Tank against Mobius by retrieving three pieces of technology, changing the future of Big MT forever.

    Unlike in the Mojave Wasteland and
    Zion Valley
    , all enemy creatures and characters in Big MT are part of the same faction, and will not attack each other. The only exception to this is robo-scorpions, which upon losing sight of the player character (hidden) will fight with all other Big MT creatures and lobotomites until only the scorpions or the creatures/lobotomites remain.

    Venturing beyond the perimeter of Big MT will result in a warning. Staying beyond the perimeter will result in being automatically teleported back to the Sink balcony. This happens even when over-encumbered with no penalty incurred and no health damage. It comes with the added benefit of furthering the
    Outer Space
    challenge.

    The only three radio stations that can be listened to in Big MT are the
    mysterious broadcast
    , the
    Happy Trails Expedition Broadcast
    , and the
    Sierra Madre Broadcast
    ; all others are blacked out. These are the three add-on radio stations.

    Tibbets would occasionally still be referred to as the Big Empty by developers in design documents.
