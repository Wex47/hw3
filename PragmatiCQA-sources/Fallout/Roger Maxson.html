    West Tek
   </a>
   achieved breakthrough results in the
   Pan-Immunity Virion
   Project. The United States
   Department of Defense
   , in fear of international espionage, moved a military team under the command of
   Colonel Robert Spindel
   and Captain Roger Maxson onto the site to secure and oversee the project, now dubbed the FEV (

   ) project.
   On January 7,
   2077
   , all FEV research was moved to the newly constructed

   to commence testing of the virus on human subjects.
   The security team was transferred to the newly constructed base as well, to provide protection for the research going on within the facility. They were not informed of the nature of the research.

    The mutiny
   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="8ba5173a-037d-4588-9b4e-aa99360b6fe9">
   The secrecy backfired shortly before October 10, 2077, when soldiers stationed at the base discovered the human testing that was going on at the base, made worse by the fact that the scientists were using military prisoners as test subjects. Colonel Spindel suffered a nervous breakdown, locking himself in his office, leaving Captain Maxson to handle the deteriorating situation at the base. The soldiers were screaming for blood and became increasingly aggressive. When two days later, on October 12, the captain stopped a soldier from murdering a scientist, he ordered the scientists to be interrogated.
  </p>
  <p key="d47b170a-54b4-419a-bc71-e9471ffd1678">
   The first scientist to be interrogated by Captain Maxson was
   Robert Anderson
   , the chief of the research team at Mariposa. Anderson explained that the testing at the facility was sanctioned and, in fact, ordered by the government, as he outlined the experiments to the captain. When Maxson refused to believe him, the scientist lost his nerve and started screaming how he was just following orders and that he was also a military man. In response, Captain Maxson murdered him.
  </p>
  <p key="8943c8a6-ef41-4ee5-975d-f947696b401b">
   This established Maxson as the leader of the rebellion. His position was further reinforced on October 15, when Colonel Spindel committed suicide as his men broke into his office. Subsequent scientist interrogations invariably ended in executions. By October 18, the scientists on the project were all dead, murdered by Captain Maxson.
   Erin Shellman
   held out the longest, almost convincing the captain that the experiments were really ordered by the government.
   On October 20, 2077, Captain Maxson declared his unit in full secession from the United States, attempting to force the government to respond to the situation at Mariposa. No response came, but news of the mutiny spread through the wider United States Army.
   A day later, he ordered the families of soldiers under his command to take shelter within the facility.

   struck on October 23, 2077. As Maxson was halfway through prying details from
   Leon Von Felden
   at West Tek, he was cut off by the nuclear detonation at the West Tek research facility. Spared the nuclear devastation, Mariposa protected the inhabitants from nuclear fallout and the wild FEV flooding the wasteland. Fearing that

   On October 25,
   Sgt. Platner
   volunteered to take atmospheric readings outside the base. Reporting no significant amounts of radiation in the atmosphere, final preparations for the Exodus (an event later referred to by that single word) were undertaken. On October 26, Maxson ordered the remains of the scientists to be buried in the wastes outside the base. A day later, on October 27, former U.S. servicemen and their families left the base under the leadership of Captain Roger Maxson, heading for the

  <p key="307b3b74-4cff-4144-82f4-67c68bd25a79">
   In November, a few weeks later, the refugees arrived at the bunker. The people suffered casualties along the way, as while the soldiers enjoyed the protection afforded by their
   T-51b power armor
   , their families did not. Marauders that attacked the caravan on its route quickly learned to target the unprotected civilians. Although for every lost civilian two raiders fell, many lives were lost,
   <span class="va-color" key="99c1dc4a-fd36-4cb6-87e2-bd2786619877" style="color: gray;">
    including Roger Maxson's wife.

   Several soldiers broke off during the Exodus as well, under
   Sergeant Allen
   .
   He demanded the leadership to allow him and his group to explore the ruins of the

    West Tek Research Facility

   for advanced technologies left behind. Ignoring warnings from Captain Maxson, Allen's faction separated from the main caravan and ventured southeast to the Glow, taking their power armor with them. They were never heard from again.
  </p>
  <p key="002b3a2b-64fd-456e-b4fd-359214350624">
   The remaining Exodus survivors claimed the bunker as their own. The soldiers established it as a headquarters for their organization while the refugees expanded and adapted it to fit their own needs, transforming the bunker into a bastion of technology in a world that had lost centuries of technological development overnight.
   Shortly afterward, Maxson and his men used a communications satellite to contact other Army units across the country. One such unit, based in

   Elizabeth Taggerdy

  <p key="c232ae3f-a070-4105-a33f-a4be16641dcf">
   Sometime later, in
   a proclamation to his men
   , Maxson declared that the United States had failed to protect its citizens and serve their needs during the years leading up to the War, and stated that they must form a new order to preserve civilization: a "Brotherhood of Steel."
  </p>
  <p key="c617967e-7301-4f30-ab0d-7a7f32da1f5d">
   The beliefs of the Brotherhood were shaped by the experiences of Captain Maxson. At first, the Brotherhood focused on aiding survivors to the best of its ability, acting as an armed fighting force, rather than a military order it would become. The change came with the realization that the collective knowledge of humanity was in danger of being lost for generations to come. To keep the secrets of the past alive, Maxson decided to dedicate the Brotherhood to the preservation of technology and human knowledge, collecting it so that the Brotherhood might become the catalyst for humanity's rebirth. As the guardians of civilization, the Brotherhood would focus on the big picture, with direct aid considered a secondary concern.
   While scribes were originally considered second-rate members, merely tools to protect knights and maintain the Brotherhood's bases, this change in priorities placed them on equal footing with soldiers of the Brotherhood, tasked with preserving and developing technologies recovered from the field by the knights.
  </p>
  <p key="c3ffcbe7-41e7-489c-8cd3-618545357333">
   Maxson's intention was to maintain the Brotherhood as an organization that worked closely with people outside of its ranks, as protectors of civilization rather than its gatekeepers. His idea of an open Brotherhood put him at odds with isolationist members of the Brotherhood, including his own son and Paladin Taggerdy. Although nobody confronted him openly on the issue, out of respect for his role as founder, Roger Maxson was in the minority.
  </p>
  <p key="3fd0f9f8-33fb-440b-b080-723321117a66">
   Maxson remained in frequent contact with the Appalachian chapter, often broadcasting speeches about specific elements of his philosophy in creating the Brotherhood. Maxson was deeply troubled by the sudden appearance of the

   </a>
   , advising Taggerdy on setting up kill zones to lure the Scorched into. Elizabeth pleaded with Maxson to grant her team permission to use nuclear weapons against the scorchbeasts but was forbidden by him because he found the concept of using nuclear weapons, even to help fight the scorchbeasts, to be too morally abhorrent after their world was destroyed by nukes.
   He maintained communications until the satellite burned in the atmosphere, as no one was left to correct its orbit. In his
   last transmission
   , he assured Taggerdy of his complete trust in her leadership and promised to send help as soon as he could.

   Although the trip took many months, with the Council of Elders having doubts about Rahmani's faith in the Brotherhood, Maxson remained adamant in his belief of her, but also urged her to reestablish communications with the Lost Hills chapter as soon as possible.
   However, Rahmani has effectively delayed going through with this order, as she is more focused on establishing a positive presence in Appalachia, further deepening the rift between her and

     Words have power, Lizzy. They build identity. They take on a meaning if you keep using them, even if it didn't exist to begin with. It was the Knights and Scribes after the fall of Rome that protected what was left of Western civilization. So we are the new Knights and our role is similar. But we'll need more than names. We'll need new traditions,
     our own, well, mythology

There are several voice lines for Maxson that are not used anywhere, and can only be found by searching through all audio files.
