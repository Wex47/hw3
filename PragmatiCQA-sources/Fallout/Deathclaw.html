    Deathclaw
   </b>
   is a term referring to genetically-engineered creatures developed by the
   United States
   military
   to replace humans during close-combat search-and-destroy missions. The Jackson's Chameleon was used as the basis.
   They escaped into the wild in the aftermath of the Great War, and over the next few decades colonized much of the former United States, becoming apex predators in many of the new, post-War ecosystems.

   by the U.S. government as a cheap replacement for human troops during combat operations, deathclaws were derived from a mixed animal stock, primarily the popular Jackson's Chameleon. Although the project was successful in creating a ferocious predator capable of surviving on its own in the wild, no references exist of them ever being deployed on the battlefield. After the Great War, deathclaws escaped into the wild and quickly spread across the continent. The

   They began developing a unique culture, as the first known non-humanoid sentient beings in history.
   However, their intelligence was discovered by
   Dr. Schreber

   Deathclaws are a large, carnivorous,
   bipedal reptile species, designed for maximum lethality. The choice to make them bipedal was natural, as bipedalism raises the head, providing a greater field of vision and thus improving the ability to detect targets or resources. The upper limbs were also freed by this choice and could be fashioned into extremely dangerous weapons. The caveat is that the deathclaw is not as fast as a quadrupedal animal, though this is a largely academic concern. However, deathclaws have been observed running on all fours when charging prey. The rippling musculature of the deathclaw provides it with superior strength, excellent speed, and incredible resilience in most combat situations.
   Deathclaws communicate with each other in a pack using growls and body language, though they are also capable of mimicking human voices like a parrot if their intelligence is artificially increased.
  </p>
  <p key="962ac472-b42d-493e-bae6-35fb926204ca">
   Their strength is further magnified by their claws. Owing to their lineage, the deathclaw has opposable thumbs, though an additional two fingers were coded into the genome, for a total of five fingers on each hand. Each terminates in a sharp talon that allows the reptile to wound and kill with frightening efficiency; a single swipe is capable of bisecting an unarmored human
   in seconds.
   Deathclaw hide is extremely tough, providing an excellent defense against blunt and edged weapons. Firearms and energy weapons are reliable tools for killing a deathclaw, though lower powered variants are likely to have trouble piercing its skin. The defense is enhanced by horns and dorsal spikes, making melee combat a very dangerous proposition.
  </p>
  <p key="21f51607-ffbd-4ff5-adda-6a8622ca9e49">
   However, while they are difficult opponents, their keen senses can be used against them. Loud noises and bright light, such as that emitted by flares, can be used to deter a deathclaw's advance or even keep it at bay.

  <p key="6eaa4534-bd34-4039-be0a-61aca8206137">
   Deathclaws are pack animals, with the leadership role assumed by the alpha pair, the strongest male and female deathclaws in the group. The remainder of the pack follows the leaders and migrates along with them.
  </p>
  <p key="bd60f696-bc92-4b5a-9ec0-743644880c8b">
   Coupled with their pack behavior is a fierce territorial instinct. Deathclaws will usually opt for territories away from inhabited areas (most likely due to noise), but may settle into temporarily abandoned human buildings and areas, as was the case with the
   <a href="Boneyard.html" key="e1609a8d-56ea-4387-8fa4-434a7a2f26bf" title="Boneyard">

   warehouses circa

   or
   Quarry Junction
   in

   .
   Once it claims a territory, a pack is exceedingly difficult to dislodge, as the alpha male will not abandon a claimed territory even if the pack mother is killed,
   while the alpha female will simply choose another mate to procreate.
   As such, reclaiming a deathclaw territory usually requires either killing both pack leaders, causing the pack to scatter,
   or wiping out the entire pack. Neither is particularly easy.

   Deathclaws are made even more dangerous by their reproductive instincts. Unlike Jackson's Chameleons, deathclaws are an oviparous species, female deathclaws will lay eggs in clusters, sired by the strongest male deathclaws in the pack, typically the alpha male. Survival of the pack is coded into deathclaws and the pack leaders will instinctively select only the strongest partners for procreation.
   If killed, the pack mother will typically be replaced by another female in short order.

   While
   deathclaw eggs
   are durable and resilient, with a remarkably long shelf life,
   deathclaws will seek out dark, sheltered areas to set up their nests.
   Lone deathclaws will also claim territories and create nests, usually in sheltered, secluded areas. If they are female and have been impregnated by a male deathclaw, they will prepare a separate nest for their young, protecting their hardy eggs with whatever small objects are at hand, such as small rocks, fallen leaves, twigs, and bones leftover from their meals.

   A juvenile deathclaw is born without prominent horns or dorsal spikes, which grow as it matures, and both of which act as secondary sex characteristics. Horns grow forwards on males, with larger being the more desirable,
   and grow back and upwards on females.
   Dorsal spikes grow much the same way as horns on males and act much the same way with larger being more desirable,
   but on females, dorsal spikes do not grow as large as they do on males and tend to be short in comparison.
   Claws, on the other hand, are present from day one. Baby deathclaws are born with a light brown skin tone and live under the protection of their parents within the pack.
   The skin darkens as the deathclaw matures, reaching deep brown upon entering adulthood,
   and eventually dark brown, black or even black and blue for old, experienced claws.

   The Enclave sought to exploit their fierce instincts and ferocity and use them as cheap, expendable troops for use in hostile environments. Their initial experiments, starting in
   2235

   focused on using a modified

   Gruthar

After the first unit was fielded, Doctor Schreber's experimentation revealed that fact and the whole breed was summarily exterminated at the site they were first unleashed:

   Subsequent efforts, once the Enclave regrouped at

   . These devices are surgically implanted into a captive deathclaw's brain and skull, allowing Enclave troops to issue commands to the fierce reptiles as if they were pets.
   Of course, even without human interference, deathclaws are a continuing hazard in the wastelands. Despite the efforts of hunter teams, they continue to set up nests throughout the wastelands.

   The ferocity of deathclaws and their incredible resilience has earned them the respect and fear of wastelanders. Initially, the existence of deathclaws was treated with skepticism in the first century after the war,
   and many considered them a tall tale, on the order of ghosts and demons.
   However, the steady increase in deathclaw populations eventually secured them a place in the common consciousness. When used for comparisons, deathclaws are usually synonymous with ferocity and resilience.
   Occasionally, they're used to insult people; allegedly, they're as bad as marketing directors.

   The result of Enclave experiments, Gruthar's pack was subjected to FEV injections that conferred increased intelligence in order to create expendable troops for use in hostile environments. The project succeeded beyond the Enclave's intent, giving the pack intelligence ranging from that comparable to a human eight-year-old to matching or even surpassing adult humans. The increase in intelligence brought with itself sentience and self-awareness, which coupled with their instincts and pack behavior created fearsome predators. The emergence of intelligence also brought conscience along with it. Gruthar's rational thought led to the pack adopting an isolationist, pacifist philosophy to allow for the coexistence of humans and deathclaws. However, they did not avoid violence if it was necessary for the survival of the pack.

Unfortunately, the artists took one look at my concept sketch and said, 'Dude, that's way too much hair.' It was true. The Wolverine-bear was very furry, and there was just no way around it.
So here's what happened: the newly formed Black Isle started work on what would be Planescape: Torment. One of the first art pieces was a monstrous creature called a Tarrasque. It was sculpted in clay and was then point-by-painstaking-point digitized into a 3D model. As Planescape moved forward, it turned out that the Tarrasque wouldn't actually be featured in its design, leaving that tasty model in disuse. Thus, the furry wolverine-bear became a hairless reptilian biped. (Take a look at page 339 of the D&amp;D second edition Monster Manual. Holy cats! It's a Deathclaw!)

    , deathclaws were mammals covered with fur and were meant to be a mix of wolverine and brown bear, created by FEV.
    The reason it lost the hair from concept to production was a technical limitation of the rendering software, which couldn't get all the hair to move properly. The hairy deathclaw in

    (according to Scott Campbell), as a Tarrasque clay model was already made and this way the work would not go to waste. However, according to
    Chris Taylor
    , while they do look Tarrasque-like, it was not intentional and the clay model was supposed to be a deathclaw from the start.

      I met my first Deathclaw in middle school, playing Fallout on a friend's machine, and I fell instantly in love with these "Dragons of the Waste." It was an honor to tackle them for Fallout 3 - sourcing from both the originals and the concept art of Adam Adamowicz - but I'm proudest of my Fallout 4 redesign.
      <p key="8e955246-6a54-467a-a475-f5d838ca9c7d">
       To improve upon their F3 counterparts, I gave the newer ones thicker, more armored skin; shorter, strong-looking claws and hands; a bull-like redesign to the horns (to suggest the ability to ram); and a thicker tail - heavy enough to act as a counter-weight when it ran. It's important to note, too, that the Deathclaw is not a mutant, but a hybrid bioweapon created by the US military. To that end, I incorporated chameleons, alligators, bulls, panthers, serpents, &amp; lizards into their design.
      </p>
      I love him.
