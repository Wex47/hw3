   The United States Army was a direct descendant of the Continental Army created to defend the fledgling nation, although its 21st-century history would put it far from its roots. By mid-century, it was an incredibly powerful tool of an imperialist state, used when economic pressure could not achieve its political goals.

   The first known example of the Army acting in this capacity came in
   2051
   , when the United States began exerting pressure on
   Mexico
   to protect their economic interests there, primarily the
   crude oil
   supply. The U.S. deliberately destabilized the country through economic pressure, paving the way for a military invasion.
   American units seized oil refineries and infrastructure to ensure the flow of crude oil did not cease.
   Not long afterward, rising oil prices worldwide bankrupted smaller nations and led to the
   European Commonwealth
   declaring war on the
   Middle East
   ; the United States was severely affected by the skyrocketing prices of oil. In subsequent years, this would become known as the beginning of the so-called

   Against the backdrop of an increasingly worsening international situation, including nuclear exchanges in the Middle East and the
   Euro-Middle Eastern War
   , the United States stepped up its efforts to militarize. One of the first major projects emerged in
   2059
   , as the
   Anchorage Front Line
   was established in
   Alaska
   to protect the state's natural resources. A side effect of this decision was the escalation of tensions with

   A year later, in
   2060
   , available fuel reserves were on the brink of depletion worldwide.
   The problem was further emphasized by the collapse of the
   European Commonwealth
   and the
   Middle East
   oil powers, as the oil fields were exhausted.
   Together with a deteriorating economy and worsening social climate, the United States began to crack.
   The Third Red Scare was a response to the increased hostility of the
   People's Republic of China
   , primarily its intelligence operations on American soil, and pervasive propaganda that blamed the nation's problems on Communist foes.

  <p key="44c593d3-0861-4657-9782-d422caaba1b7">
   The Army was particularly affected by the fuel shortages, as its vehicle fleets became crippled by fuel shortages, although it did not stop them from deploying
   cargobots
   in
   Appalachia
   in late 2060 for providing reconnaissance and delivering supplies. In response to the shortages, the United States Army initiated a research program to develop
   power armor
   in
   2065
   .
   Although no prototype proves itself to be workable in the field, intense research, development, and prototyping paved the way for future advances in military, construction, and most importantly, cold
   fusion technology
   .
   The military continued research in other areas continues as well, including more powerful nuclear weapons.

  <p key="2f509a93-aac1-4f63-900b-60b80852c239">
   These advances would prove crucial for the Army in the near future. Spring of 2066 was the turning point in history, as oil resources dried up across the globe causing an energy crisis in
   China
   . Bordering on collapse, the Communist state aggressively pursued a trade agreement with the United States to export crude oil to the Asian superpower. The talks eventually broke down,
   culminating in the July 24 declaration by the U.S. president that the last known supply of petroleum would be used exclusively by the U.S. and they would not sell or trade any oil to outside parties.
   Adding further insult was the public announcement of the development of the first crude
   fusion cell
   , an offshoot of the
   power armor
   project, in the summer.

   In the winter of
   2066
   , China launched an invasion of
   Alaska
   to seize its natural resources and stave off collapse. This daring, trans-Pacific military operation began the
   Sino-American War
   , the last war the United States would ever fight.
   The initial invasion overwhelmed American defenders. Military units of the Army and other branches of the military found themselves reeling from the initial attack, retreating on all fronts well into 2067, despite the Canadian government backing down and acquiescing to American demands for transfer rights through Canadian territory at the end of 2066.
   It was not until the first suits of
   T-45 power armor
   were pressed into production that the Chinese thrust into the nether regions of America was slowed and halted. The first units proved to be incredibly effective in defense, but somewhat lacking in offensive capabilities. As the Chinese military lost the initiative, the situation rapidly deteriorated into trench warfare as neither side was capable of breaking the stalemate and forcing peace terms on the enemy.

  <p key="f95c3aa2-274c-4c69-a37d-31ff46fee9e3">
   The war continued, with the Army and other branches liberally drawing on Canadian natural resources to support its war effort. Protests from Ottawa were routinely ignored as Canada became Little America: A colony of the last superpower on the continent.

   On the domestic front, the Army deepened its ties with the corporate world, as its robotics program developed. The Army commissions
   RobCo Industries

   General Atomics International
   , long-time suppliers of combat robots to the military, to create the most powerful combat robot in the history of warfare. Its mission? To liberate
   Anchorage
   , Alaska from
   Chinese
   occupation. The project was meant to serve both military and propaganda needs. The former dictated the capacity, the latter the design: In the words of General
   Constantine Chase
   , initiator of the project, Liberty Prime was to embody the American military: A walking, talking, nuke-tossing hero reminding enemies of the U.S. that they picked a fight with a global superpower.
   Confident that the project would soon yield result, General Chase publicly confirmed in June 2072 that the U.S. Army was working with General Atomics and RobCo to create a superweapon meant to establish dominance of the United States on the Alaskan front.

   . The American economy strained as American soldiers, Marines, sailors, and airmen fought a war on three fronts: Canada, Alaska, and mainland China. Neither side was willing to yield, despite eight years of constant warfare. The situation rapidly deteriorated into a stalemate, just like in Alaska.
   Ambitious flanking maneuvers such as the
   Gobi Campaign
   ,
   and the
   Yangtze Campaign
   , where U.S. Marines rapidly overran
   Shanghai

   Later that year, the Army gained a decisive advantage. The
   T-51 power armor
   finally completed testing with the
   Corps of Engineers
   in June, giving the American soldier the tool they needed to confront the Chinese. Next-generation power armor was rapidly manufactured and provided to mechanized cavalry units. Sent to the Alaskan and Chinese fronts, they carved a swath through Communist forces. The Chinese economy crumbled under the onslaught and supply lines from nations annexed by the
   Beijing
   regime started falling apart.
   However, the Washington regime did not fare any better. In August, food and energy riots started in urban centers across the United States. A state of emergency and eventually martial law was declared, with Army deployed on the domestic front to fight their own countrymen.
   Demoralized troops behaved like thugs towards their own countrymen.

   However, the effect did not last. As American troops pushed deeper into the mainland, Chinese resistance increased. By October, the situation transitioned from a rout into a stalemate.

   United States Armed Forces

   technological
   superiority.
   T-60 power armor

   T-51

They were essentially mobile firing positions, filling a similar (but not identical) niche as
   tanks

   railguns
   in the form of the
   M72 Gauss rifle
   and the
   PPK-12 Gauss pistol
   (which the United States fielded as well

   production models like the
   Wattz 2000 laser rifle
   or the modular General Atomics
   AER-9
   were issued to frontline troops in China and Alaska.
   The weapons have not yet managed to eclipse conventional armaments, but provided a significant edge to United States forces, thanks to the versatility of power cells: A micro-fusion cell could power anything from a close-range scattergun to a high-precision long-range laser marksman's rifle.

   Robotics played an important role in Army operations. Apart from
   sentry bots
   , designed originally for guard duties – used to carry heavy weapons into combat on a semi-autonomous unit,
   the Army also employed a variety of other robotic materiel. Among the materiel were
   cargobots
   ,
   protectrons
   , the more advanced
   Mister Gutsy
   robots (militarized versions of the popular
   Mister Handy
   utility robot), which entered service in 2077,

   assaultron

   RobCo
   design was built as a frontline wartime combatant. Fast and deadly at close range, and employs a devastating laser at a distance. Some units can even employ
   stealth technology
   .
   With the progression of the War and subsequent straining of personnel, the military began a process to automate facilities wherever possible, effectively replacing the staff with machines.

   With the advancement of cyber-robotics came the development of the
   robobrain
   . Developed shortly before the war by
   GAI
   , the robobrain was uniquely designed to accept brains as its central processor. They were intended to be a multipurpose platform, with such duties as to command units of robots, interrogation, and to fill tactically proficient combat roles.

  <p key="9912bdd0-a3a5-4325-9804-1e071d29a647">
   Despite the resource crisis, the Army continued to field its extensive vehicle fleet.
   Trucks
   and
   armored personnel carriers
   were commonly used on the domestic front,
   while
   tanks
   provided the firepower necessary on the frontlines and occasionally the home front.
   The biggest asset of the Army was the
   Vertibird
   transport VTOL, enhancing the mobility of power armor units.
   A new and improved
   prototype XVB02 Vertibird
   tiltrotor gunship was in development by 2077, with full-scale adoption planned for
   2083
   .
   Lastly, though they can hardly be considered aircraft, hundreds of orbital micronuclear platforms were also placed in orbit around Earth, to provide tactical fire support for military forces or defend the home front if need be.
