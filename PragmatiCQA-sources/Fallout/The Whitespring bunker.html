   At first, the player character can only access it through the bunker entrance on the world map. Once they are a member of the Enclave, they can enter the bunker through either the resort, via a secret entrance on the third floor in a small hall with the elevators in the southeastern wing upstairs from the governors' hall, or by using
   the Whitespring service entrance
   .
   All of these entrance routes lead directly inside the bunker, in the military and production wings respectively.

   The Congressional Bunker was built beneath
   the Whitespring Resort
   to ensure continuity of the
   US government
   by providing protection and shelter for members of Congress, the
   president
   , and the Cabinet in the case of a nuclear strike. In order to ensure its habitability even without human workers, it was designed to be a fully automated, machine-managed refuge from nuclear war. The support AI,
   MODUS
   , was a custom-built system designed to oversee the habitat,
   which could hold up to 200 dwellers.

   subverted the project early on, adapting it for their own needs. The bunker's construction was financed by the
   Department of Agriculture
   , led by Secretary of Agriculture
   Thomas Eckhart
   , a member of the Enclave. The facility was connected to Enclave hubs across the

   -
   Raven Rock
   , the
   Presidential Rig
   , and others - with the intention of using it as a nucleus of all Enclave operations.
   For support, the bunker was provided with the
   Kovac-Muldoon
   , a secret satellite in geostationary orbit above Appalachia, capable of spying on every mile of its soil, delivering orbital missile strikes, and even conferring automated promotions in case the chain of command fell apart.

   , when the early warning came, and the government officials that remained nearby rushed to shelter.
   Secretary of Agriculture
   Eckhart, the Secretary of the Interior, the
   Secretary of the Treasury
   , and a select few other Enclave and non-Enclave members alike made it to safety, together with a number of high ranking officers. The rest were left to fend for themselves.
   Despite all the people present in the bunker, all non-Enclave personnel who arrived were executed, including members of Congress.
   Immediately after the bombs dropped, the survivors were horrified to discover that hard-line connections to Raven Rock and the oil rig had been lost, leaving them isolated, as impossible as that seemed.
   Following the deaths of both the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Eckhart was next in line for command of the Whitespring bunker.
   Established succession and the severance of communications gave him the opportunity he had planned for.
  </p>
  <p key="380a25b1-c243-4943-8ee8-e163e783ff80">
   After gathering survivors in the conference room above Bunker Operations, Eckhart informed them of the isolation and the death of the Secretary of the Treasury due to "radiation sickness," then announced himself as the new leader of their "little enclave," as per pre-War rules of succession.
   He then offered them a choice: use the Whitespring to continue the war or oppose his plans. Those who opposed using the facility and the Appalachian resources were summarily executed once they revealed themselves.

   Although the purges entrenched Eckhart's control, he only had 48 people left to "save" democracy. He wasted no time and focused on his driving obsession: the eradication of communism by any means necessary, with no moral or ethical constraints. It was all-out-war and no option was off-limits, even another nuclear strike. Eckhart sought to gain control of the three
   automated nuclear silos in Appalachia
   -
   Site Alpha
   ,
   Site Bravo
   , and
   Site Charlie
   - in order to launch a final strike against
   China
   . The bunker's extensive scientific, medical, and production facilities were essential to the project, sustaining the Enclave for the next several years.

  <p key="3e2822a9-f45c-47c7-961a-03b25b68040e">
   In 2082, the bunker's ranks grew tremendously with the inclusion of survivors from
   Colonel Ellen Santiago
   's unit, who arrived there after leaving the smoldering ruins of
   Washington, D.C.
   behind them.
   With an influx of veterans, the work towards the eradication of communism advanced at a rapid pace. The experiments with mutations continued in parallel with work on accessing the nuclear arsenal, resulting in many working serums and the first
   <a href="Scorchbeast.html" key="a4bbc85b-7679-4258-9a89-63129551c0da" title="Scorchbeast">

   </a>
   , accidentally created when Enclave scientists exposed irradiated bats to biochemical experiments the previous year. Eckhart ordered further study of the creatures in controlled habitats at the abandoned
   AMS
   mining complexes while keeping the officer corps in the dark.
   In the meantime, to further secure his own authority, Eckhart had Enclave personnel hack into Appalachia's automated election systems in order to run for President of the United States; he won handily, as his Enclave soldiers cast the only votes in January of
   2083
   .
  </p>
  <p key="229f89aa-f354-45ca-b7a7-b4ad39da94b6">
   As Eckhart's attempts to bypass the DEFCON system escalated, however, the Enclave started to split apart. The system prevented launching nuclear strikes from the region's automated nuclear silos unless DEFCON 1 was reached and in the years since the Great War, DEFCON dropped to low levels. Eckhart planned to fool the system by unleashing ever more horrifying dangers on Appalachia, up to, and including scorchbeasts. Disgusted by these machinations, Santiago threatened to quit in 2084. Now a general thanks to the automated promotion system at
   Camp McClintock
   , she held the keys to the nuclear arsenal, and Eckhart could not go ahead without her. Realizing that, the self-declared president had her knocked unconscious and kept under lock and key in the bunker's brig.
  </p>
  <p key="bd27ae33-92a9-4ddf-8879-519385f16d7f">
   Without anyone to stand in his way, Thomas Eckhart proceeded with the plan and unleashed his scorchbeasts in the region. As the DEFCON system plunged to 1, the organization split apart into two factions: Eckhart's hardliners and Santiago's loyalists, who openly rebelled in mid-2086. Led by
   Captain Jackson
   and
   Major Ragnarsdottir
   , the rebels fought the hardliners across the bunker. Although they successfully managed to retrieve General Santiago and restore her command, they failed to account for
   MODUS
   ' interference or the ferocious fighting across the science wing.
   In order to save Appalachia, Santiago ordered all landline connections severed and the destruction of the biological weapons research records, contained in MODUS' data banks. The plan backfired when the AI turned on all human members of the Enclave. After an explosion tore out a large part of MODUS' memory, the damaged AI retaliated, killing General Santiago and rupturing a toxin tank that leaked into the air circulation system. MODUS promptly sealed the bunker, dooming all within - including President Thomas Eckhart.

   After the events, MODUS immediately set out to restore the facility to its former glory, even though the damage caused by the fighting - and its effective lobotomization in the ill-fated destruction attempt by Santiago - made progress slow. Sanitizing and decontaminating the bunker of the biotoxin was among the biggest challenges, especially if the blinded and deafened MODUS was to have any chance of regaining a connection to the outside.
  </p>
  <p key="a61c34b8-9813-43e1-835a-3a83cd730d61">
   In the years afterwards, MODUS regained some stability and used the bunker's robots to repair the damage. By the time the
   Vault Dwellers
   of
   Vault 76
   entered the bunker, much of the location had been restored to its earlier splendor, arranged with robotic precision. However, sections of the facility were still sealed away by cave-ins and structural failures. MODUS remained unable to contact Control Station ENCLAVE for further instructions. It patiently waited for a prospective assistant to arrive from outside to help it restore communications.

   The Whitespring Bunker has two exterior entrances, including the main entrance consisting of a blast door built into a hillside a short distance from the Whitespring Resort with a parking lot that is accessed by a side road, and a secondary entrance can be found near the Whitespring service entrance. A third entry in the form of an elevator is accessible within the Whitespring Resort's main building and is concealed behind a sliding wall panel. All three entrances are protected by laser grids that prevent unauthorized individuals from passing through them; these can be deactivated with

   , with the concrete replaced with wood paneling, a fully automated staff, and an incredible level of opulence. Before heading deeper into the bunker, following MODUS' lure, the player character can examine the storage pit underneath the catwalk that leads into the entrance area. Among Vault-Tec containers lies a destroyed
   Assaultron
   , which can be repaired with Intelligence 7+.

  <p key="7fcc8f01-8f60-426d-9688-1dbd4d79c2e9">
   Those that enter the bunker must first be photographed and then led through a decontamination apparatus to remove any traces of radiation. The road to MODUS is linear, as the elevators leading to the lower levels are not unlocked until orientation is completed. Down the right-hand side lies the locker room where those with access to the bunker disrobed. Down a decontamination arch is the processing station, where MODUS will require a photo of the player character (its comment depends on the current Charisma score) and reward them with a
   Forest Operative underarmor
   from the dispenser.
  </p>
  <p key="6fbd0114-96c4-47ff-b37d-50beee044b8b">
   Moving down, the player character will be encouraged to collect refreshments from the stations near the billiards table (the right-hand corridor is buried under rubble, hinting at what transpired), and then they are permitted to meet MODUS in person, which explains who it is, what the Enclave was (or is), and encourages the player character to join.

  <p key="46694b72-c7a6-4cf5-9c62-438c854fa24a">
   Next is the admittance floor, where new residents must register themselves and optionally take a questionnaire about pre-War U.S. history. To the right of admittance are two elevators that lead back to the orientation floor. The questionnaire prompts a variety of responses from MODUS, none of which actually affect the player character's opportunities. To access the facility beyond this point, the player character needs to finish

   The central area of the level is the foyer, which contains an old derelict restaurant and connects to the elevator in the lobby of the bunker. East of the foyer is the Production Wing, which contains MODUS training terminals as well as every crafting station in the game. The Production Wing also leads to a side exit from the facility, which allows the player characters to directly come and go through the Whitespring service entrance. From the Production Wing, the main chamber housing the MODUS core is accessible through the robotics facility, flanked on either side by an Enclave

   On a balcony overlooking the communications section is an area denoted as Operations. It consists of two rooms on the balcony, the first being the Cabinet Meeting Room with a long table and a wall-mounted terminal. The second room is the Executive Suite, originally meant for the president, though it is blocked off by a door and several layers of laser grids. Access to the Executive Suite would have been a reward for completing the

   From the lowest level of the communications room, the Medical Wing and Science Wing are located to the east. These rooms contain crafting stations and treatment terminals. Player characters have access to medical supplies, miscellaneous science supplies, and mutation serums. On the opposite side are the Military Wing and an exit to the resort, which leads player characters to the southeastern corner of the resort, near the governors' hall. The Military Wing once served the highest military officers, providing them with a commanding view of Appalachian territories and access to nuclear codes. Following the rebellion of General Santiago, much of the section was destroyed. Parts of the level have been restored, but as the heaviest fighting took place here, it was impossible to restore to full functionality.

  <p key="62483dda-a039-49c4-b555-b601bf0259bf">
   At first, the player character will only be able to access the communication section of the Military Wing, containing workstations and a map. To gain access to the areas beyond they will need to complete basic training at Camp McClintock and attain the rank of private in the

   . This will unlock the section, which contains run-down cells, the brig/torture chamber, and an execution room, all of which have not been restored by the AI. It's mostly of historic interest, as this is where the Enclave executed all non-members after the bunker was sealed and where General Santiago was imprisoned by President Eckhart.

Overlooking the Communications Room, the Command Center consists of the War Room, including the automated nuclear launch training for newly minted generals, decryption machinery for nuclear codes, and the adjacent armory with crafting stations, an automated armory trade terminal that gives access to Enclave clothes and weapons, and an archival terminal.
