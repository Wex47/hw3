   the Glow

   . After exiting their Vaults, harsh life taught these vault dwellers the folly of war and conflict. The group developed a purpose in educating humanity about the horrors of the Great War, so not to repeat such atrocities again.
  </p>
  <p key="4642a5f8-004b-44bb-9cbd-1f782401d464">
   The first steps towards the formal establishment of the Followers happened in the 22nd century, when sickness was spreading among the settlement's inhabitants,
   leading the parents of
   Nicole
   to gather the survivors and move north.
   During the trip, however, her parents were killed by marauders. The death of her parents motivated Nicole to establish the Followers of the Apocalypse, to educate the wastelanders and spread knowledge so that another

   By 2161, the Followers moved into and salvaged a
   library in the Boneyard
   . Widely known, they were considered a little strange, but generally harmless. Some believed their peaceful ways were not cut out for this world: they were allegedly poor combatants and knew nothing of the "real world."
   Of course, their survival and expansion proves this notion to be simply untrue. Indeed, their focus on preserving knowledge, with emphasis on agriculture and medicine, had already manifested by this period and laid the foundation for their future presence. The emergence of the

   , another ostensibly peace-minded cult, raised more than a few eyebrows among the Followers. Spies sent out by
   Nicole
   brought back disturbing news, including reports of

   removed the only clear obstacle in the way of Follower expansion. The Followers gradually established control over the Boneyard, as a center of higher learning and research. When the

   formed, the fledgling nation-state joined forces with the Followers. The influx of knowledge and education helped solidify a strong relationship.
   The Followers focused on their goals and eventually, the Boneyard became the first known place in the wasteland to boast a University. Staffed and maintained by the Followers, the school would offer courses on a non-profit basis to anyone willing to learn.
   By 2246, the Followers had enough resources and influence to send out scholars on expeditions to gather knowledge, including information on tribal dialects. That year was when the fateful expedition of

   But for a time, everything seemed to be in order. Cooperation between the Followers and the NCR prospered. Trouble began with the beginning of the
   Mojave Campaign
   . In 2273, a contingent of the Followers under
   Julie Farkas
   moved into the Mojave, assisting the Republic's forces. The imperialist project of
   President
   Aaron Kimball
   rapidly chilled relations.
   The failing relations were also fueled by internal dissent. While the Followers held a near-monopoly on education, particularly higher education, in the Republic's lands, some members of the organization were dissatisfied with the knowledge-centric profile of the organization.
   This eventually resulted in a split in
   2275
   and the formation of the
   Office of Science and Industry
   by dissenting Followers. Focusing on practical applications of science, they became rivals of the Followers, aligned with the NCR and offering competitive higher education possibilities, though many of OSI's executives hold the Follower ideals close.
   The NCR soon broke most ties with the Followers, and turned their support to the fledgling Office. In response, some of the Followers instigated a campaign to erode what little support NCR has among the locals of the frontier.

   With the Great War, humanity lost many things, like methods of agriculture and techniques for basic survival and the Followers took it upon themselves to piece together this forgotten knowledge and bring it to the wasteland.

   In terms of philosophy, the Followers combine the principles of voluntary association, cooperation, and equality characteristic of anarchism and a disdain for conflict that bears a striking similarity to pacifism. Of course, the Followers are well aware of the flaws in human nature and ideology doesn't come before reality.
   Despite that, they want to bring peace back to a wasteland that tends toward destruction.
   Specific ideologies of the Followers vary significantly, ranging from anarcho-syndicalism to socialism, to communism.

   Angel's Boneyard Medical University
   .
   Outside their Boneyard operations, they operate a network of regional hubs, offering their services to local residents, although their ability to provide these services varies on the availability of supplies. Some frontier hubs, like the
   Old Mormon Fort
   in
   Freeside
   , tend to become overwhelmed without support from local merchants or powers like the NCR.

  <p key="cc8dec19-f4e3-4f93-a081-5f30e12f56f2">
   The Followers are a highly decentralized group with limited hierarchy. Any leaders are typically informal and selected naturally, based on their deeds, expertise, and organizational skills. Formal structures exist in a limited fashion. The aforementioned hubs and the administrators that maintain them coordinate the activities of Followers operating in the region
   and permanent operations, such as reconstruction and relief efforts.
   As the Followers are always looking for new members,
   they can be inducted at the discretion of local administrators, either as fully-fledged members (typically after they have aided the local hub in some way)
   or as probationary initiates. The administrator can assign duties to probationary members, including positions such as junior archivist,
   assistant to a full member,
   or cataloging the Pre-War Unexploded Munitions Collection in

   Followers offer free education for all who are willing to learn,

   They also offer medical support and other aid to those in need, both at hubs and by direct action. Every member is asked – not ordered – to help those in need when the opportunity arises.

   Westside

   The latter is a textbook example of the Follower philosophy: Leveraging local resources to allow for sustainable agriculture. By irrigating the desert,

   enabled Westsiders to cultivate crops, while restored refrigerators allowed for storing food for later use or trade. As a result, Westside became a self-sufficient, ordered community with prospects for growth.

   the Followers are one of the few organizations to devote time to both hard and soft science. Their research efforts include topics as diverse as studying the sociological, linguistic, and anthropological aspects of the people of the wasteland (including

  </h3>
  <p key="a4aab3e8-3cef-4604-9fcd-b8958d5ae23f">
   As a fundamentally non-profit organization, the Followers rely on a variety of sources to acquire supplies for their operations. For a good hundred years between 2181 and 2281, the Followers sustained their operations by salvaging old hospitals and medical warehouses,
   and various donations, in return for discounts on their services.
   Charitable donations continue to represent a major source of their funding and sources, particularly when it comes to providing low-cost medical services to the less fortunate.
   The preferred donation size is 500 caps from the rich who can afford it,
   although the Followers will accept any amount – and especially material donations like medical supplies.
  </p>
  <p key="8513d6b3-5aae-4325-abaf-af7ea97e90b4">
   The Followers also sell a portion of their stock of supplies to fund their operations, but salvage and donations alone are insufficient to make this a major source of funds.
   For this reason, the Followers greatly prefer to establish sustainable relations with local providers, such as providing medical services to farms in exchange for food. More specific resources, such as raw chemicals and
   alcohol
   that permit the Followers to manufacture medical supplies they need for their operations and trade, are difficult to source and they usually have to compromise for the greater good. For example, in the
   <a href="Mojave Wasteland.html" key="10497585-6003-422b-a15f-667e57d29bec" title="Mojave Wasteland">
    Mojave
   </a>
   , they can be convinced to work with local pushers – people they normally oppose – maintaining their distillation equipment and providing intake in the form of food waste. In exchange, they would receive the aforementioned supplies, allowing them to expand their services and influence, improving the lot of Freeside residents in the long term.
  </p>
  <p key="e46b4426-242a-4f07-ac96-41250437107b">
   Of course, this source of supplies and funding only works as long as the other party is willing to accept what the Followers offer. Most merchants, like the
   Crimson Caravan Company
   , refuse to deal with the Followers on anything less than market terms.
  </p>
  <p key="b2ef1653-fe29-4fdc-9d8d-aab017c5422b">
   Ultimately, the Followers prefer for themselves and the people they care for to be self-sustainable. This means trading only for the necessary raw materials and manufacturing the supplies they need, especially when it comes to medicine.
   Education and improving infrastructure contributes to this goal, as if local residents are able to source food and water on their own, it frees up Follower resources that can then be assigned to high priority goals.

   As the Followers have no desire to control territory, they rarely clash with other factions.
   Historically, they enjoyed close relations with the
   <a href="New California Republic.html" key="41379f15-038f-4607-8b65-34c039e0a989" title="New California Republic">
    New California Republic
   </a>
   for a time as the Republic's technical advisors, researchers, and educators, but the change in foreign policy and a push for subjugating the East soured them. Disagreements over how wealth and prosperity should serve the people of the wasteland led to the aforementioned breaking of ties in 2275 and the cessation of support for the Followers from the NCR authorities. Many among the Followers are therefore bitter about the NCR's actions and see themselves as janitors, cleaning up the NCR's mistakes and trying to introduce stability into the regions they claim.
   Some also take it upon themselves to deny ancient technologies to the Republic, on the basis of the fact that they can prove incredibly destructive.
   Although closely associated with the NCR government, the Followers retained their independence and pursued their own separate goals.
  </p>
  <p key="6fb19227-39b4-46b6-89a6-732386c68167">
   The NCR has no official policy against the Followers but has waged a propaganda campaign against the Followers which has stained their reputation in New California to a certain extent. While NCR citizens can be dismissive of members of the organization as bleeding-heart idealists at best or anarchic cultists at worst,
   the Followers continue to operate excellent facilities in the Republic,
   including the
   Angel's Boneyard Medical University
   .
   Even the
   Office of Science and Industry
   considers the Followers more as a competitor and worthy rival, rather than the enemy; the Follower's goals are simply humanitarian in origin, rather than economic.
  </p>
  <p key="02fdfb10-791a-413b-9acb-27dc0b522c6a">
   These facilities are the Followers' greatest asset. Their willingness to teach others for free and help the people of the wasteland makes them welcome among the less wealthy denizens of the wastes, particularly on the frontiers. Of course, sometimes their teaching has unpredictable effects. When a Follower taught the

    Great Khans
   </a>
   how to read and write, as well as basic science, the tribe harnessed the knowledge for the production of recreational drugs to sell to the
   Fiends
   , inadvertently causing major problems for the Republic.
   As a result, the Followers withdrew their support almost entirely.
  </p>
  <p key="ee1315a1-67aa-442e-8067-09af15a4acc6">
   Besides the NCR, there are only two factions the Followers are not particularly thrilled about. The first is the

    Brotherhood of Steel
   </a>
   , with its desire to hoard technology and prevent it from being used for the common good; completely antithetical to the Followers' beliefs.
   The second is, of course,
   Caesar's Legion
   and the Followers do not even entertain the thought of allying themselves with the Legion. After defaming
   <a href="Caesar.html" key="d10fc1fd-5f8d-4800-9d99-3b2387838399" title="Caesar">
    Caesar
   </a>
   , a former Follower himself, the Followers seldom talk about this dark aspect of their history.
   Needless to say, the Followers of the Apocalypse are uneasy about their connection to a man who has created an empire based on militarism and institutionalized slavery and has denounced the Legion's brutal methods of conquest. Though both sides follow completely different philosophies, Caesar himself holds some measure of respect and appreciation for raising him as a child and providing him with an education, in spite of his derision for their ideals.
  </p>
  <p key="5a3683e5-7ca2-49ff-b0ed-60f7292a6cf8">
   The Followers stationed in the Mojave also show no love for

   and the surrounding personnel running New Vegas, who locked Freeside out of the city and does nothing to support the people in the surrounding neighborhoods. The Followers are struggling to keep Freeside in enough medicine and all Vegas does is think about running their casinos.
  </p>
  <p key="94d47a66-ba7b-42f4-8f25-5fa368a8b9b4">
   The Followers of the Apocalypse are highly respected in Freeside, where their main base of operations in the Mojave Wasteland is located. Locals admire them for their charity, and maintain an amicable relationship with the
   Kings
   , whom the Followers praise for the security they provide, as well as their chivalrous attitude. In turn, the Kings appreciate the Followers for providing much-needed services to those that live in the area. Cooperation between the two is just about the only thing that keeps Freeside from collapsing into chaos and strife.

   Their medical aptitude is the most noticeable facet of their operations. The Followers offer formal medical training to all at the Angel's Boneyard Medical University, ensuring a uniform level of knowledge and skill among their doctors,
   which is then put into practice using the best available materials, up to and including
   Auto-Docs
   in some clinics.
   The latter represent the apex of Followers' medical capabilities, as they are capable of both restoring and improving the human condition. Using them, Follower physicians can perform surgeries and apply
   implants
   to improve performance anywhere, including the kidneys, eyes, and the brain. Some clinics also offer experimental military implants, like the
   NEMEAN sub-dermal armor
   modification or
   PHOENIX Monocyte Breeder
   implant.
   Their medical expertise is not limited to merely the physical. Follower ranks also include psychiatrists capable of treating a variety of mental disorders, including PTSD.
  </p>
  <p key="8fe872a5-e14e-48a5-a2c5-1d78600b7035">
   Due to the aforementioned supply issues in outlying hubs, Followers also focus their efforts on researching new methods of obtaining medical supplies and other materials, which would allow them to greatly expand their efforts outside

   Other avenues of technological research include solar power as a sustainable alternative.
   Aiding in their efforts is a substantial amount of data recovered from pre-War times, including extensive records on the various corporations that operated in the United States, like
