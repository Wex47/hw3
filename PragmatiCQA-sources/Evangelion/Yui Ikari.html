     Yui's beliefs may also be exemplified in her romantic relationship with Gendo, however, Gendo's desire to be associated with SEELE raised questions concerning whether he was truly in love with Yui or whether he was using her to get closer to SEELE. The fact that his every action for the next decade was made in pursuit of reuniting with Yui suggests he was not just using her; conversely, since she kept some of her agenda secret from Gendo, she may in a sense have been using him.

     As the SIRP Manga has a lighter tone than most other Evangelion Series, Yui Ikari is not only still alive, but often used as a comedic character. She is very much the driving force in her marriage, and often assumes authority over Gendo.

     As with the initial series, Yui is stated to have been killed in a tragic lab accident when Shinji was a boy. In the finale, it is revealed that Yui had survived and instead ended up being absorbed into the Tree of Y'ggdrasil, an artifact that maintains the stability reality. She kills Gendo after he attempts to force Shinji into the tree as a replacement, which leads to her own demise as well. After Yui's death,
