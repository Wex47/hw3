However, Shinji doubts it, as he notices that his old friend seems to be in a sort of trance. While Super Eva and Euro-II fight, a fleet of UN military planes fly over them, towards Tokyo-3. They blame Nerv for all the people that turned into salt due to the Lance of Longinus, and they want to seize control over the headquarters. Fortunately, a massive swarm of locusts ruins their engines, and the remaining planes are easily shot down by Nerv’s defenses. Euro-II and Hikari abandon the battlefield and fly away.

She realizes that the Lance of Longinus is teleporting Earth’s mass to the moon, and that’s why the planet is shrinking. After that, Asuka finds a mysterious crystalline structure, and when she enters in it, both she and her Eva are overwhelmed with data from millions of different lifeforms. She learns that Earth and the moon have been switching places for several thousand years and that it’s about to happen again.

They are attacked by the Euro-II Eva, so Kaji takes control of Quatre and uses her mutant Unit-0.0 to escape along with Misato and Kensuke, teleporting them to the Atlas Mountains in Africa. This is where they find the Ark, an ancient crystalline structure which contains the data of all life forms that have ever existed. It’s also the same one Asuka found on the moon, since the Ark is split into two existences so that it might survive unharmed thorough eternity. Unit Euro-II appears and attacks again.

Armaros vanishes and Quatre frees herself from Kaji’s control; but Trois disappears, and so does the mutant Unit-0.0. Hikari is freed from her trance and she recognizes the mutated Unit-02, calling for Asuka to no avail.

Toji takes a small plane and flies into the battle, where a stray attack shoots him down.

   Affected by pain, Shinji goes into an almost berserk state, making the Super Eva trash around; but Asuka manages to calm him down. She explains to him that, because of the unfinished

   , his dream is now merging with reality, manifesting in anomalies such as the classroom. Maya finds a message carved onto a piece of metal, from Gendo Ikari and Ritsuko. They are alive, but trapped outside of time and watching events unfold. Meanwhile, in Europe, Hikari and Heuterbise become the new Armaros, taking Kensuke with them and causing untold destruction.

   Asuka suggest they go to Yomotsu Hirasaka and destroy the lens, which are now siphoning seawater to the moon. She believes that such an action will attract Armaros’ attention. In the dream classroom, Shinji hops back into the entry plug, returning to his body, frozen in time inside the Super Eva. He reactivates it, managing to keep the last 0.82 seconds of Third Impact at bay. Super Eva –now christened as the Final Model–, takes off, with Asuka and Toji following in a VTOL. Meanwhile, using her mutant Eva, Rei Quatre takes Kaji/SEELE to Nerv, where he negotiates with Misato: information in exchange for the Longinus replica. Around the same time, Mari regains some of her animal instincts and features. She slips under Nerv’s vigilance and sneaks into a boat on route to Yomotsu Hirasaka.

   In the new island, Shinji is attacked by the Angel Carriers, which have regenerated thanks to the power of the Ark. During the fight, he falls into subterranean magma and finds Lilith’s Chronostatic Sphere. Influenced by its power, Shinji contacts two other possible versions of himself, and together they summon the Lance of Lucretius. Shinji uses it to destroy the spatial lenses, bringing Armaros to the island. In the meantime, Asuka sees Mari running through the jungle and follows her.
  </p>
  <p key="c44b8c80-bd5a-4610-8026-dc3647ea63c8">
   Upon arrival, Armaros is attacked by a reconstituted giant Wolfpack, who now has Unit-02 embedded into its forehead. Mari fuses with Wolfpack while Asuka climbs to the head and manages to reactivate Unit-02. They aid Shinji in the fight against Armaros, but the black giant summons a Torwätcher containing Kodama’s soul, and then it turns Toji into another Torwätcher. The original Lance of Longinus comes down from space and tries to stab the Final Model, but it’s absorbed by the roots of the World Tree, which manifest all across the world, bloating the skies. In Nerv, Kaji/SEELE explains that the roots are “the road that connects the Human Instrumentality Project.” They’re also what Armaros, the Towätchers, the Angel Carriers and Quatre’s mutant Eva have been using to teleport freely around the world.
  </p>
  <p key="a3e61003-7ec3-4d37-849c-a27f9ff1ccd6">
   Using the Ark, Asuka fuses with Unit-02 one more time, becoming Crimson A1. Shinji is forced to use some of the power of the stopped Third Impact, but in doing so he brings the cataclysm 0.5 seconds closer to completion. With the original Longinus lost inside the World Tree, Armaros flies through the roots to Tokyo-3, to steal Nerv’s replica. Rei Quatre takes the replica Lance and uses it to crack the Glass Egg, destroying both in the process and bringing back the old HQ into reality, along with Gendo, Ritsuko and many others. After this, Kaji is freed from SEELE’s control. At the same time, a massive volcanic eruption in Yomotsu Hirasaka launches Lilith’s Chronostatic Sphere into the moon.

  <p key="29b1a8f1-13d7-42a0-9b9b-7599cebf7e26">
   Armaros fuses with the roots of the World Tree, taking the form of an immense giant of darkness who threatens to destroy Tokyo-3. They urge Shinji to let as many people as possible inside dream classroom, since it’s indestructible as long as he’s alive. He also releases the final power of Third Impact, turning the Final Model into a giant of light. Shinji burns some of the roots of the World Tree and cuts one of Armaros’ arms, but in doing so he frees the original Lance of Longinus, and the spear plunges right though his heart, putting a stop to Third Impact. In the dream classroom, Toji reawakens Bardiel’s essence within his body, which allows him to take control of his Torwätcher form and extract Hikari and Kensuke from Armaros. Asuka realizes that Shinji’s consciousness must be intact somewhere, since his dream still exists, and so she calls out to him. Kaji tells her to “think of the one she loves” and that she “must give him a vessel.” On the real world, a dimensional rupture appears on Crimson A1’s lower body, and a brand new Eva, piloted by Shinji Ikari, comes out. This process returns both Asuka and Unit-02 to normal.

   Shinji gets ready to destroy Armaros, knowing full well that he will become next one; but Mari appears, still fused with Wolfpack, and kills the black giant. Using her powers as the new minister of the Human Instrumentality Project, she takes the Ark and the Lance of Longinus to Apple’s Core. The moon becomes the New Earth, since the original has lost its Ark and too much mass. Shinji, Asuka, the Reis and the other pilots will have to look for a new moon to stabilize the orbit of New Earth; but first, Shinji wants to speak with his father.
