   (also known as the "Giant Impact") is an
   Impact
   which occurred in prehistoric times when the

   , a giant spherical object, collided with the Earth in what is now the Hakone region of
   Japan
   . The collision caused an explosion that launched a massive amount of material from Earth into orbit. This orbiting debris eventually coalesced into Earth's only
   moon
   . The Black Moon is the vessel that carried

   in what is now
   Antarctica
   . Having two Seeds of Life on the same planet violated an ancient rule of the First Ancestral Race. Under that rule, only one Seed of Life was allowed to populate any one planet at a time.
   Lances of Longinus
   , which can disable a Seed of life, were sent to accompany each seed in order to enforce this rule. However, Lilith's lance was seemingly lost during First Impact. This meant that Adam had to be placed into suspended animation by its Lance of Longinus in order to comply with the rule. With Adam incapacitated, the progeny of Lilith, including

   Angels

   Billions of years later, when humans dominated the Earth, the public explanation for the cause of First Impact was a huge meteorite, rather than the Black Moon. Although originally referred to as "Giant Impact," this event was retroactively dubbed "First Impact" after the

    The real-life
    Giant Impact Theory
    states that during the early formation of the solar system, a Mars-sized planetoid named "Theia" collided with proto-Earth as it was still forming. The ejected material from the collision coalesced due to gravity and was caught in Earth's orbit, becoming the Moon.

    In the anime, the public was not aware of what actually caused the Second impact, so newspapers created cover stories that the Second impact was caused by a meteor strike. The general public (in the anime) then assumed that the First impact was the famous meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs. In reality, the First Impact
