   translates directly as "New Century Evangelion" or "New Era Evangelion". The term "Evangelion" is in relation to the ancient Greek term for "good messenger" or "good news". The name was chosen in part for its religious symbolism, as well as for the fact that Hideaki Anno said he liked the word "Evangelion" because it "sound[ed] complicated".

   . While the initial episodes focus largely on religious symbols and specific references to the Bible, the later episodes tend to go deeper into the psyches of the characters, where it is learned that many of them have deep-seated emotional and mental issues. Through the exploration of these issues, the show begins to question reality and the existences therein. Much of the series's content was based on Hideaki Anno's own clinical depression.

The Impact is believed by the public at large and even most of NERV to have been the impact of a meteorite landing in Antarctica, causing devastating tsunamis and a change in the Earth's axial tilt (leading to global climate change) and subsequent geopolitical unrest, nuclear war (such as the nuking of Tokyo), and general economic distress. Later, Second Impact is revealed to be the result of contact with and experimentation on the first of what are collectively dubbed the

   Along with the battles against the Angels, the central characters struggle to overcome their personal issues and personality conflicts, which factor heavily into the events of the series and its eventual conclusion. Throughout the series, many of the main characters constantly have to cope with several social and emotional problems: characters are unwillingly forced to confront socially complex and challenging situations; unresolved sexual tensions grow between numerous characters; injuries, deaths, and defeats cause blows to their psyches; and previously steady relationships begin to falter.

   In the last two episodes (the second set in 2016), Gendo and Rei initiate the Human Instrumentality Project, forcing several characters (especially Shinji
   ) to face their doubts and fears and examine their self-worth, with sequences that "suggest animated schizophrenia".
   This ending was made up of flashbacks, sketchy artwork, and flashing text "over a montage of bleak visuals, that include black and white photos of desolate urban motifs such as a riderless bicycle or vacant park benches interspersed with graphic stills of the devastated NERV headquarters in which Shinji's colleagues are seen as bloodstained bodies",
   and a brief interlude depicting an "alternate"

We weren't taking on any subcontracting work for anime production. We did continue to make PC games – Akai had seen to that – but there wasn't a lot of work tossed our way.

He would work out numerous plans and projects, both on his own initiative and in collaboration with others, but they all fell through, and in the end, Anno's idle days were dotted with projects that he imploded by design. In the midst of all this, one project, a feature film entitled

Hideaki Anno's use of Freudian psychoanalytical theory, as well as his allusions to religion and biology are often idiosyncratically used and redefined to carry his message.

   invokes many psychological themes. Oftentimes, titles of episodes, titles of music used in the series, and other repeated phrases are based on psychological concepts such as those of
   Sigmund Freud

   Jacques Lacan
   . Some such phrases include "

   as being related to a "dive into the unconscious". Additionally, the Evas' connection with their pilots could be deciphered as a psychological connection and conflict. As the series progresses, the
   hedgehog's dilemma
   is mentioned, referring to humans' inability to get close to each other without causing pain to one another; this term is used to related directly to Shinji Ikari, but applies to other characters in the series as well.

   Beyond Freud and Lacan, elements of
   Gestalt therapy
   are laden throughout the series. This theory is directly referenced in

   is titled "Introjection", a Gestalt term for a mechanism in the human brain designed to process experiences.

   The characters in the series seem to extend deep psychological traumas, oftentimes in relationship with their parents. Shinji, a classic case of introversion and social anxiety, seems to get his psychological traits from the loss of his mother at such an early age, coupled with the perception of his father abandoning him. Asuka, a victim of her mother's insanity, found her mother after she committed suicide, which led to her hardened exterior personality and satisfaction from piloting the Evas. Like Shinji, Misato experienced neglect from her father; in
   Episode 25
   , Misato mentions that Ryoji Kaji reminds her of her father, which has led to an ambivalent feeling toward him. A display of further conflict is seen from Ritsuko, who, after seeing her mother having an affair with Gendo, is simultaneously attracted and spiteful toward him.

   To further the psychological prevalence in the final two episodes, they are stripped of their colorful visuals and shot with muted tones as Shinji is heard asking himself deep, brooding psychological questions. In these two episodes, Shinji and Asuka both display the fact that they experienced similar pasts; Shinji, however, claims he has no life without the Evas, though this is later disproved in the final scene of
