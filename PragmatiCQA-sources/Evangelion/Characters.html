   's characters' ages were plotted before broadcasting the TV series, but their birthdays were not settled.
   After the TV series finished, GAINAX released birthdays which were similar to those of each character's seiyū, except Rei Ayanami, Toji Suzuhara, Kensuke Aida and Kaworu Nagisa.
   This time, the characters' birth years were still not revealed.
  </p>
  <p key="66ca2672-751f-43be-aa71-d615bcfaf53f">
   Adult characters' birth years were simply calculated from their age, but there was an additional aspect in determining the children's ones. According to the Japanese educational system, in 2015 second graders of junior high school (eighth graders) are basically made up of children who were born from April 2, 2001 to April 1, 2002.
   Children's birth years were set in proportion to this rule. However these birth years did not change the children's ages of 14 in year 2015. This is the reason why Asuka Langley Soryu and Toji Suzuhara were born in December 2001 and Hikari Horaki was born in February 2002, despite all children except Kaworu are 14 in 2015.

   in the English adaptation. He is the son of Gendo and the "late" Yui Ikari. Abandoned by his father when he was a toddler, Shinji has grown up to be reclusive and withdrawn, choosing to often run away from difficult situations.
   Over time and with encouragement from Misato, he learns to be less cowardly, more outspoken, and more confident, but his progress is undone near the end of the series.
   He becomes friends with Toji Suzuhara and Kensuke Aida, something akin to a sibling relationship with Rei, and enters into a confused love-hate relationship with Asuka.

   Little is known about her as of yet except that she is the pilot of the Provisional Evangelion Unit-05 which differs from previous incarnations drastically featuring four mechanical "legs" that end in wheels and a lack of hands which have been replaced with a jousting lance and "claw". Because of its unique design, Mari pilots her Eva wearing a helmet-like contraption and her plugsuit is equipped with several attachments that connect to tubing that apparently help her in moving the Evangelion. Mari's designation amongst the other Children has yet to be revealed. She self-destructs Unit-05 to defeat one of the Angels in the film's opening but manages to escape unharmed. During the film's climax she steals Unit-02 to battle the 10th Angel. Unable to defeat the Angel, she finds Shinji and tells him to escape. Shinji, seeing the destruction, makes up his mind about fighting. As Unit-02's power goes out, Shinji runs to NERV HQ. She has a fondness for LCL, making a comment to Shinji, "You smell good... Smell of LCL." She seems to have poor vision, wearing glasses at all times and having difficulty finding her glasses when she drops them from the collision with Shinji while parachuting. While piloting Unit-02, her plugsuit features a 5 on the back. This symbolises that she is the pilot of Unit-05. In the preview of the 3rd

Shortly thereafter, he was directed by his superiors to initiate a similar arrangement with Gendo Rokobungi.

   appears to be a triple agent, working as a special inspector for NERV (Internal Affairs) while secretly investigating NERV for the Japanese government, and at times seemingly acting as a cat's-paw both for and against Gendo Ikari and SEELE - in addition, he appears to have his own personal agenda independent of any organization, searching for the "truth" behind NERV, SEELE and the Human Instrumentality Project. During college, he and Misato were lovers, but broke up at Misato's insistence. Years later, they are reunited on the UN fleet ferrying Unit-02 and Asuka to Japan.
   After he returns to NERV headquarters, Kaji and Misato rekindle their romance following a period of teasing and insults, when Misato confesses that she broke up with him because she realized that he reminded her of her father. He is eventually shot and killed by an unnamed assailant after defying his employers one time too many,
   but not before giving Misato information regarding the truth of the Instrumentality Project. His Japanese voice actor is

He also seems oblivious to the intense physical and psychological distress endured by Eva pilots. Nevertheless, Kensuke enjoys the privileges of being the friend of an Eva pilot.

   is the class representative of the class that Shinji and the other Eva pilots attend. She has a by-the-book demeanor and takes her responsibilities as "class rep" seriously. Although she frequently bickers with Toji, she reveals to Asuka that she has an enormous crush on Toji but is unable to openly express her feelings to him. She also appears to be Asuka's only friend. Hikari is an accomplished cook who appears to take care of her two sisters. Like presumably every one of Shinji's classmates, Hikari's mother is dead. However, no references were ever made as to whether her father is, either. Her given name, and that of her unseen younger sister, Nozomi, and elder sister, Kodama, is also in reference to the names of the trains of the Tokaido Shinkansen line.
   In a Gainax artwork picture she is shown in an orange plugsuit as the pilot for EVA Unit-05.
   She is also featured in a live action deleted scene in

   is a "hot spring penguin" and Misato's pet. He lives in a custom refrigerator in Misato's apartment, enjoys taking warm baths, eating whatever food he can get his hands (or wings) on, and going to hot springs. He also appears to have a relatively high degree of intelligence, as he is also shown watching TV and reading newspapers. He is voiced by
   Megumi Hayashibara
   in the Japanese series. His English voice actors are Amanda Winn-Lee during the series and movies,
   Mandy Clark
   in the "Director's Cut" episodes, and
   Monica Rial
   in the Rebuild of Evangelion series. In the manga, he is the result of a genetics experiment at Misato's former workplace, and she adopted him after the experiment's conclusion rather than let him be euthanised. His wingtips have retractable claws, which normal birds do not have.

   A shy female character, Mana Kirishima, starts at Shinji Ikari's school and immediately admits to finding him cute. Gradually, a relationship unfolds and they end up going on a date where they kiss. It turns out, however, that she is one of three test pilots of TRIDENT, a new competitor to the Evangelions, similar to Jet Alone (thus the name "Girlfriend of Steel"). Eventually, the other robot goes berserk and the Evas have to destroy it. Throughout the game, Asuka is constantly jealous of Shinji and Mana's relationship, consistent with her widely-speculated romantic feelings for Shinji. Rei is present but plays a rather background role in the story. She is voiced by
   Megumi Hayashibara
