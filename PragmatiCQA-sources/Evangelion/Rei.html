The circular wall of this room is originally depicted as being covered with DNA sequences, but near the end of the series, it is revealed to be an LCL-filled tank in which dozens of soulless clones of Rei are held. The clones are said by Ritsuko to be the cores of the dummy plugs; she also refers to them as "spare parts" and later as "vessels" for Rei. The movie pamphlet and volume 11 of the manga state that she can be replaced entirely, with her soul being transferred to a new clone body every time she dies, although her memory becomes muddled with each transfer. Other supporting evidence in the anime includes her earlier line that "if I die, I can be replaced."

     At the start of the series, Rei is socially withdrawn, seemingly emotionless, and rarely interacts with anyone, except for Gendo, to whom she initially displays loyalty but with whom she has a generally distant relationship. She lives by herself in a dull sparsely-furnished apartment in

    As the series progresses, she begins to develop relationships with others and to show moments of genuine emotion,
    to even become sad and cry.
    Her English voice actor, Amanda Winn-Lee describes her saying, '"Rei is not totally devoid of personality, otherwise she would not be interesting." There is a small spark of humanity, but it is "clouded by this huge sense of negative self-worth and the realization that she is expendable." The joy of playing Rei is exploring that small spark.'
    And also said: "I got into a weird mode - I can't describe it. It's a good thing I'm in a little padded room when I'm doing it because that's where she belongs. She knows she's expendable, but the thing is, she's still human so you can't do her totally catatonic."

     , it is strongly hinted that Rei is in love with Shinji. Shinji reciprocates this affection to some degree, but is unsure of what he feels for Rei and where their relationship is going. In volume 9, he acknowledges that the gap between them has been considerably reduced since they first met; still, he hopes that this gap can be reduced further. Her desire to be recognized as a person, rather than as a "doll," puts her in some awkward, even dangerous situations. At one point, Ritsuko tries to strangle her when she talks back to the doctor.

     In the battle against Armisael, when the Angel communicates with Rei, it attempts to make Rei believe that her soul is evil; that she does want Shinji for herself and is angry at Asuka for drawing Shinji's attention away. As in the anime, she self-destructs Unit-00 to destroy the Angel. However, it's hinted that the "new" Rei still has some residual memories as she wonders to herself why she is alive again after returning to her quarters.

     Now that she is 17, she more and more resembles Yui Ikari. Because of that, she tries to stay distant with Shinji: she fears that she may become Yui herself.

     In the three years since SEELE’s failed invasion, Rei Trois has opened up to others, even becoming friends with Asuka. However, she still has many doubts regarding her nature and her feelings, not helped by the fact that Shinji is unconsciously seeing her as a replacement for his mother, something that Trois detests. These doubts only get worse after the psychic backlash caused by the other three Reis gaining independence. At the end of Volume 2, Rei Trois loses herself so much that she becomes mind-controlled by the SEELE-possessed Kaji. Fortunately, Shinji manages to free her, and Rei Trois cries for the first time in years, letting all of her emotions flow free.

     The other Reis are clones created to pilot the three new Evangelion Units 0.0, since Misato refuses to use real kids. Originally, the three clones are semi-mindless, with Trois having the power to control them from Earth’s surface. They spend most of their time floating in orbit, ready to strike any Angel-type threat that might be detected. However, after Rei Quatre is infected by Armaros’ scales, the connection with Trois is severed, and the clones develop their own individual personalities.

     Rei Quatre becomes a rogue agent, originally acting according to Armaros’ plan but eventually shifting her allegiance to SEELE. Trois identifies Quatre as the fears of Rei Ayanami made flesh, and she is the one most bothered by the fact that Shinji sees her as a mother. She seems to have a sort of romantic attraction towards Shinji, since she kisses him a couple of times; but he doesn’t reciprocate the feelings.

     Here, she's portrayed as an intelligent girl (on par with Asuka in the series) and expresses emotions, as opposed to her original counterpart, smiling a few times and even becoming confused when Shinji becomes flustered after she asks him whether she looked good in a swimsuit. She even laughs in one instance at Shinji and Asuka's constant bickering and defended herself with "It just seemed amusing". However, due to her unhappy childhood, she's also somewhat cold to others. In another homage to the series, Shinji again sees her stepping out of the shower naked. This time, however, she smiled coldly at Shinji before slapping him which sent him to the floor.

She leads a secret life, working as a "Shamash Guardian" for a group hidden in the school and dedicated to fighting against Angels. Rei wields the Lance of Longinus in combat. She has shown more emotion than most other versions of the character, such as shock at the discovery of Shinji's powers and boredom while reading a textbook.

After befriending Shinji, she chooses not to go along with Gendo's plans, resulting in him angrily shooting her.

     Like many of Evangelion's characters,
     a Japanese World War II naval vessel, the Fubuki-class destroyer Ayanami. Her first name comes from the character Rei Hino of the anime and manga series Sailor Moon. This was done to get one of Sailor Moon's directors, Kunihiko Ikuhara, to work on Evangelion. Written in kanji, Rei (零) can also mean "zero", "null" and is a pun on her Evangelion 00. The band Kinniku Shōjo Tai's theme song
     <i key="108975ed-b6a5-4858-af47-7b330d96f78c">
      Doko e demo ikeru kitte

     and its line "hotai de masshiro na shojo" (lit. "the white girl with bandages") inspired Sadamoto to draw Rei.
     The same band produced a song named
     <i key="1f758b60-9ddf-4f47-88a6-cb742d6bfc55">
      Fumimi no kodomo (福耳の子供)
     </i>
     , in which a female monologue is audible, and Sadamoto tried to portray a girl with a similar voice.
     Ukina, a character from Sadamoto's previous work Koto, served as Rei's model, giving her "shaggy, bobbed, wolf-like hair".
     Another source of inspiration was
     , a novella written by Paul Gallico; the story describes a painting portraying the protagonist, a thin and pale girl in an empty room.
    </p>
    <p key="66807698-27f0-4ccf-bca4-b3bbf5ad48cb">
     Anno requested a ""cool character with short hair" and designed Rei originally as a brunette with dark eyes; however, it was necessary to distinguish her from the other female protagonist Asuka Langley Soryu, so Sadamoto designed her with eye and hair colors opposite to Asuka's.
     Initially, Anno requested her as "gloomy".
     While Asuka was conceived as "an idol-like figure" in Neon Genesis Evangelion and a symbol of "heterosexual desire", Sadamoto designed Rei as a "mother figure",
     thinking of her as "the Yin opposed to Asuka".
     As such, he decided to give Rei more room in the manga, emphasizing Rei's maternal role.
     One of Sadamoto's early designs include a black-haired girl called "Yui Ichigo", though this might be an early version of
     <a href="Yui Ikari.html" key="0dfb6945-246b-4716-82ef-a215e0ea62f6" title="Yui Ikari">

     , also alternating between green and teal hair.
     Anno also suggested that Rei's eye color be red, a feature he believed would give her more personality and distinguish her design from those of the other characters. Her hair color changed to blue, similarly to the main character from

     Black allowed him to differentiate her from the characters of the series released in the same period and go against their trend.

     As with many other Evangelion characters, Anno transposed some aspects of his life into her character, including the choice to not eat meat and maintain a vegetarian diet.
     He also took inspiration from Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic concepts and the Oedipus complex in particular, since "there was this replacement by a robot, so the original mother is the robot, but then there is a mother of the same age, Rei Ayanami, by [Shinji's] side, who's also by the side of the real father".
     In a discarded draft of Rei's character background, Rei was a more sensual character than her final version. Sadamoto, unlike the more frank and explicit Hideaki Anno, decided to give her a much more "enigmatic" and bland eros.
     According to Sadamoto and assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki, she was conceived as an alien entity, but Gainax later went on to make her at least genetically human; Rei should have had both the human genes of Yui Ikari and the First Angel,

     During Evangelion's production and first broadcast, Anno encountered difficulties writing the character, not feeling "particularly interested" or relating to her, but he thought of her as a representation of his unconscious mind likening her to Kaworu in that regard, in contrast to Shinji, Asuka and Misato as his conscious parts.
     She is also likened to Kaworu by staff in many other instances.
     He also conceived her as "the unconscious Shinji".
     For a long time he forgot to "explore Rei's personality".

     Anno acted instinctively, without following a well-defined plan for the development of the characters, but from the beginning he had the idea of Rei's death, then presented in the twenty-third episode.
     Compared to most other characters, Rei received relatively few changes compared to her earlier ideas, with the notable exception that in
     Episode:01
     she would have still defeated the Angel on her own, piloting Unit-00, though not kill it.
     During production, Ikuhara, annoyed by the idealized image and the fetishism that some fans built around the character, proposed to Anno that they "betray" fans and show her as a real girl who gets married and "gets pregnant in the last episode", but Anno rejected the suggestion.
     In the original finale wanted by Anno, the giant Rei added in the film EoE was not foreseen, since it was conceived at a later time.
     Anno himself declared he considered her character "already finished" in the episode six smile scene: "In short, if she and Shinji completely 'communicated' there, then isn't she over with? At that moment, Rei, for me, was finished.

     Frenchy Lunning has described Rei as being Shinji's anima.
     Rei Ayanami's success as a character, according to Hiroki Azuma, became a catalyst in the anime industry to shift away from storytelling and towards depicting characters with moe-inspiring traits.
     As Rei became a more prominent character among fans, she "changed the rules" governing what people regarded as moe-inspiring.  The industry then created many characters which share her traits of pale skin, shortish bluish hair, and a "quiet personality". Azuma regards Ruri Hoshino of

     as being directly influenced by Rei.
     IGN ranked Rei 10th in "Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time" with writer Chris Mackenzie noting Rei to be one of the most influential characters in anime series, but he still commented that she was different from similar characters since "She's a mystery we never really solve, when you think about it."
     She had the same place in Mania Entertainment's 10 Iconic Anime Heroines written by Thomas Zoth who commented on the large number of merchandising based on her and that she started "the moe boom in anime."
     In the survey "friendship" developed by rankingjapan.com in which people had to choose what anime character they would like to have as a friend, Rei ranked 9th.

     Sadamoto's design of the three female leads created extremely high sales of merchandise.  Figurines of a bandaged Rei "were the most popular, outselling all else".
     Due to her popularity driving sales of merchandise, Rei was called the "Premium Girl" by media.
