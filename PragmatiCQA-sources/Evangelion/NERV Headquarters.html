   The entire city of Tokyo-3 was essentially built as a fortress to protect NERV from the Angel threat and to provide housing for all those who worked there. The city was designed with the Evangelions in mind as elevators, power sockets, and weaponry litter the city. According to Gendo Ikari in
   Episode 21
   "all the resources mankind has to offer are being poured into that facility," it is truly the last hope mankind has against the Angel threat.

  <p key="67cdbe7d-06f5-4494-a99f-6ac0256ea531">
   The GeoFront has a number of train and car-train services that run into it, taking those onboard directly to NERV HQ; the car train Misato and Shinji use
   Episode 1

   The central shaft leading down into Terminal Dogma has a spiraling-elevator that opens up onto hexagonal-shaped doors, while the other shafts located about the central shaft have automated pathways that run across their expanses at increments of 10 floors.

   The levels of NERV HQ are all designated in the elevators as "B-(level)"; i.e. we see Misato and Shinji pass by a sign on a wall that says "Level 20", and the elevator they are in designates this as "B-20" etc (the "B" is drawn in a fuzzy digital font causing some viewers to confuse it for an "8"). When Misato and Shinji are passing along a shaft (going through Level 20) that extends several levels down, Level 30 and Level 40 can be seen progressively further down the shaft. Thus, levels with higher numbers in NERV HQ are deeper underground. Other maps show that different subsections of NERV HQ have different letter prefixes ("A-15", "K-05", etc.), but the main subsection that the command center is located in appears to be a large hexagon-shaped vertical shaft with each level designated with the prefix "B-".
  </p>
  <p key="3660e84b-0762-401f-bf79-c3d4a7713ddf">
   Misato's map indicates that NERV's command center is located on level B-20, saying: "NERV Headquarters:
   <a href="Central Dogma.html" key="1c4765ea-e892-4b46-bb2d-7eb95e14fb49" title="Central Dogma">

   B20". Of course, NERV's Commander Center is a massive room many levels in height, so level B-20 is presumably the level which Misato normally accesses it on. Misato has left a handwritten note in red ink on the map with an arrow pointing to the commander center, saying "this area!". Looking closely it can be seen that Misato has also left another note with arrows pointing to two other areas on the same level: "WC", which presumably stands for "water closet", that is, the lavatory (bathroom). When Misato encounters Ritsuko, she tries to hide the map behind her back out of embarrassment that she needs to use it.
  </p>
  <p key="2515f4a5-6f93-407e-a0a0-fd463b930dd5">
   Central Dogma appears to be arranged as a large hexagon, judging from Misato's map as seen in Episode 01.

   The Evangelions are stored in the "Eva pens", of which there appear to be at least seven. A movable platform raises Evas up from the pens into the nearby launching catapults, which take Evas to the surface. The relation between these chambers and the Command Center was seen in
   Episode 19
   : Unit-01 emerged from an Eva pen on the right side of the Command Center, crashed through a wall, then pushed Zeruel through the left wall and into another Eva pen. As their brawl continued, Unit-01 pushed Zeruel from the Eva pen into a catapult on the wall. However, the arrangement of the shafts and the pens remains disputed.

   The right wall of Test Facility 2, where the Unit-00 activation tests are carried out, backs on to Unit-01's cage as we learn from Episode 01 and
   Episode 02
   . Unit-01's cage is just behind the right side of the Command Center, fairly close behind the Command Center's main screen is the central shaft which leads down into Terminal Dogma, as we learn in
   Episode 20
