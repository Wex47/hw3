    In 1846, Frederic Petit, a French astronomer, claimed to have found a second moon in an elliptical orbit around the Earth. This was called the "Dark Moon" or "Black Moon" because it was nearly invisible. In 1918, Walter Gornold, an

    , dubbed the second moon "Lilith". No real scientific claims of the existence of this moon have ever been proven, but it is sometimes used in astrology, where it is closely tied to the myth of Lilith.

Also, despite having the roof excavated and covered with an armored roof as the surface of the city of Tokyo-3 (later completely destroyed), the black moon appears to be an intact sphere when it rises out of Earth's surface (Although the destroyed portion is only a small fraction of its total surface area, the damage should still be visible).
