   In Episode 14 it is revealed they were formed in reaction to mounting tensions over the Nansha Islands in 2003 between China and Vietnam.
   In 2015 they have been shown operating against the
   Angels
   many times to no avail, despite valiant efforts, with the most notable examples being the battles with
   Sachiel
   , and the later battle against the
   Seventh Angel

   When Sachiel emerged from the ruins of
   Tokyo-1
   , the angel was attacked by a squadron of Jet-VTOL gunships. Despite heavy missile barrages, little effect was made. Soon afterwards, hundreds of JSDF tanks, assault guns, MRLS rocket platform trucks, five Jet-VTOL missile carriers, and other Jet-VTOL gunships commenced an epic bombardment against the angel; remarkably, no real damage was done. Shortly afterward, an
   N2
   mine detonated under Sachiel's feet, destroying 18% of the Angel's mass. Despite elation from JSSDF staff,

In the semicircle of mountains around the city are dozens of missile emplacements, each with about twenty missiles inside, in addition there are massive bunker networks built into the mountain-sides, with high caliber artillery mounted on turrets.

   The JSSDF's mechanized ground forces operate conventional vehicles like Main Battle Tanks (which appear to be based on the M60 series), Humvees, mobile rocket and artillery MLRS platforms and other mainstays of modern land warfare.

Its arsenal also includes smaller VTOL aircraft (which are more mobile), fixed-wing bombers for deploying ballistic weapons, and large "flying wing" craft used to transport Evangelion Units(be it shipping an Eva between North America and Japan, or deploying Eva(s) directly into combat against Angels).

   Frontline infantry forces wear black bodysuits and helmets, while officers and rear-guard staff wear berets or baseball cap-like hats. Despite being frontline, general infantry appear to wear light combat armor as their suits cannot stop .45ACP rounds (as seen in End of Evangelion), apparently sacrificing safety and survivability in exchange for rapid deployment and maneuverability; Frontline personnel carry ballistic shields when assaulting fortified positions to compensate for their light armor. JSSDF infantry tactics are demonstrated during the assault on the GeoFront and specifically NERV HQ, a lightly guarded facility built to withstand Angel attacks, in which three JSSDF platoons infiltrate the exterior quietly and only engage in combat with heavy weapons once well within
