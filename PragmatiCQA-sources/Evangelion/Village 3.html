   . The decontaminated area is very extensive and includes many wooded and mountainous areas as well as rivers and lakes. The cultivation of rice is an important element for the Village and there are many fields all around. Despite the intervention of WILLE, there are still areas of disturbance near the Village, like large floating objects such as electricity towers, trains and rocks.

   Village-3 was built by survivors of the
   Near Third Impact
   . Its architecture is very basic and comes down to a set of houses made of metal sheets and recycled materials. Built near an old rail network, many abandoned wagons have been converted into homes or places to live. The constructions in the center of the Village seem to have been carried out of necessity, without taking into account a precise urban plan, like Tokyo-3. This shows a lack of organization. Another district on the edge of the village has more orderly dwellings, built with more durable materials and having photovoltaic panels to provide electricity.

  <p key="abd14f32-cc52-4b89-ba83-33218d878dea">
   Several infrastructures have been set up such as a clinic, a public bath and a library. There are also several water towers. The Village is not self-sufficient, however, and has to call on
   KREDIT
   's help three times a week to be replenished with food and materials and also facilitate trading with other surviving villages. The village included ruins of NERV's 2nd branch facility.

    After the Near Third Impact, several survivors banded together to try and survive in a devastated world. Cohabitation was not easy at first. There were many worries that appears and force the survivors to harden themselves and manage in the face of adversity. They regroup and found Village 3 to help each other and survive. With the help of KREDIT, the survivors manage to create a stable place to live. Thanks to the Angel-sealing Hex Pillar, areas are decontaminated from the corefication and become cultivable again. WILLE also makes water courses drinkable and conducts several purification experiments. It is in this village that Kensuke Aida, Tōji Suzuhara, Hikari Suzuhara and her father lives. Kensuke uses his skills of survivalism to come to the aid of others, and he carries out several missions to ensure the good preservation of the surroundings of the village. As such, he has several vehicles to move around or carry out work. Over the years, Tōji and Hikari grew closer. They settle down together and have a daughter named Tsubame. At Village 3, Tōji is in charge of the clinic although he is not trained in medicine.

She works with several women in the rice fields and thinks of settling permanently in the Village. However, her clone condition prevented her from doing so and she turns into L.C.L. after some time. Shinji arrives at the Village in a catatonic state. But the welcome given to him and Rei's words manage to comfort him and he ends up discovering the surroundings, guided by Kensuke.
