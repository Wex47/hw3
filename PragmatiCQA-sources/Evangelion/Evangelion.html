   Like the Angels, Evangelions have regenerative capabilities. It is directly stated that they are capable of regenerating damaged or destroyed organs.

   Unit-02's left leg is ripped off at the knee (which the script attributes to a blasting bolt), after which the torn off leg sinks deeper into the magma of the volcano, presumably beyond all hope of recovery; however, by the next episode Unit-02 is seen to be fully repaired with a full left leg. NERV is either capable of creating replacement limbs for the Evas (as opposed to simply being able to reattach limbs that have been severed), or of making Evas regrow lost limbs from their torso. It is not known how long or difficult of a process this might be, as it is not clear how much time passes between episodes during the fairly standalone "Action Arc" of the series, although in

   Evangelions are covered in bindings that serve to restrain them and bind them to NERV's control, and are restrained heavily at all times when not in combat. Whether the bindings serve to restrain them physically or use some other mechanism to restrict their power is not known as the functioning of the bindings is not elaborated upon within the series. The bindings appear to serve as armor of sorts, but they are presumably unnecessary in that role. The shoulder pylons serve as part of the restraint system, attaching to external restraints as well as serving as storage for weapons like the

   Unit-00 is referred to as "Zerogoki", which literally translates into "Zero Number Machine" (although a loanword from English, "Zero" in Japanese is not pronounced the same as "Zero" in English) and Unit-01 as "Shogoki", literally "First Number Machine" as opposed to "One Number Machine". From Unit-02 (Nigoki, "Two Number Machine") onwards, the "#numeral Number Machine"

The design for the shoulder pylons for the Mark series also differ from that on the standard Evangelion unit types. The spine armor pieces for the Mark series are thinner than that for standard Evangelion units, further resembling a human spine, and additional set of back plates are introduced. However, some of the Mark units have their own unique design, including

   The Mark series also displayed bizarre battle features. These units no longer wield standard Evangelion weaponry, instead, each unit has its own unique weapon of choices. The Mark.04 series utilize anti-AT Field attacks, while Mark.09 is seen equipped with a bizarre jetpack, and later a scythe as a melee weapon. Mark 09 also enhances its lifespan by altering its core to the whole body. It later displays Angelic features when taken over by a SEELE hijack system, such as transformation and firing iconic Angel-like cross-beam attacks on the

It also features a double entry-plug system and an additional set of arms. Evangelion 13's physical strength is also noteworthy, being able to pull out the two Spears of Longinus from Lilith's corpse. The unit also has the ability to be 'Awakened'.

   An Evangelion is imbued with the soul of its pilot's mother. Whether the soul or the pilot is chosen first is unknown. A pilot can easily sync only with a compatible soul. Synchronization depends upon the pilot's psychological condition.

      , the pilots were highly synchronized with their Evangelion Units. At an abnormally high synchronization ratio, it appears that pilots will really suffer injuries an Eva suffers. This may also be because being struck by the Lance of Longinus replica altered Asuka's AT field between mind and body, causing her to actually sustain injuries, but looking closely, it is evident that her guts were not pulled out when her Eva's were. She did however sustain injuries later on when struck by even more spears. In the

Shinji is seen later with a hole in each of his hands, showing that the high synchronization-level (which was of at least 250% at the time) may have effects on the pilot's health when the Evangelion is damaged. It could also be because the wounds were specifically made by Spears of Longinus.

    The Rebuild continuity seems to have a strange relationship with this concept. While the Pilots do not seem to sustain the same damage as their Evas, several effects can be seen on the pilot when the Eva sustains damage. In particular, when exposed to damage, the Pilot's plug suit seems to heat up and take similar damage to the Unit, despite not being actually under attack. This can be seen quite evidently with Mari in Unit-05, the right arm of her plug suit burning when her Eva was attacked. Similarly, Shinji's plug suit is seen glowing, as is Rei's when Evangelion Unit-01's arms were impaled by Sahaquiel and when Evangelion Unit-00 grabbed its core. Of these injuries, Shinji's are the only ones that actually seem to translate over to actual damage to the pilot, his hands later being seen bandaged after this event.

    Apparently, the internal controls of an Evangelion which interact directly with the pilot's mind which the pilot is synchronized with the Eva are set to the native language of the pilot, the "base thought language" which the Eva's systems are set to. For example, Shinji's native language is Japanese, and therefore he "thinks in" Japanese, so Unit-01 is set to Japanese. The language mode of Unit-02, however, is set to German, because Asuka's native language is German and she "thinks in" German. However, Asuka speaks fluent Japanese, so she can apparently set the language mode to Japanese, but still function well enough (meanwhile, Shinji doesn't understand German at all, so he cannot function in an Eva set to any language other than Japanese).
