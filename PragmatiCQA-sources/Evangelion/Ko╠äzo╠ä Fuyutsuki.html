     , Fuyutsuki was a professor of metaphysical biology at Kyoto University. While there, he met the young bioengineer student
     <a href="Yui Ikari.html" key="fdc6939d-c94b-4768-83e0-28af26c3820d" title="Yui Ikari">

     and became her "sensei". The exact nature of their academic relationship is unknown, although they were close and spent time together off campus. Fuyutsuki was smitten with "Yui-kun" from the start, although he kept this entirely to himself.
    </p>
    <p key="63136890-0e75-44c3-8348-9409b6a9b011">
     Not long after, a man named
     <a href="Gendo Ikari.html" key="17e1e577-9538-4469-9aed-c303879b870c" title="Gendo Ikari">
      Gendo Rokubungi
     </a>
     , who was being held at the Kyoto Prefecture Police Department after a bar fight, asked to be released into Fuyutsuki's custody. He complied, although he found Rokubungi distasteful. Yui later introduced Gendo to Fuyutsuki formerly, and then, during a hike, revealed that she was actually dating him—news that left her sensei visibly disconcerted despite efforts to conceal his own reaction.
    </p>
    <p key="99aaa9c2-fdfb-4818-a8bc-9f13e6f3456f">
     This was a strong suggestion that Fuyutsuki was attracted to Yui Ikari, as well as being impressed with her work. At the very least, Fuyutsuki appeared to share some of Yui’s admiration for humanity. In Episode 12, during a philosophical debate with Gendo at the South Pole Fuyutsuki stated that he’d "prefer a world where people live, no matter how stained with sin". Also, he has said that he agrees with Yui’s ideas more than SEELE’s.
    </p>
    <p key="14b56f63-ee3e-40d2-8b39-a04f338c79b8">
     But on a personal level, Fuyutsuki was said to want little to do with people in his earlier life
    </p>
    <p key="c0531871-d417-4c0d-8599-4442afa4106b">
     Fuyutsuki survived Second Impact, but his career as a university professor came to an end. In 2002, he "set up shop" at the ruins of Toyohashi (in Aichi Prefecture, east of Kyoto) as an unlicensed doctor to compensate for the shortage being experienced everywhere. Fuyutsuki was selected to be part of the United Nations' official investigatory expedition to the South Pole (on the basis on an anonymous recommendation by Gendo). This eventually leads him back to Gendo Ikari, director of the
     <a href="Artificial Evolution Laboratory.html" key="f204786c-fd29-4376-8ebc-743d09f24371" title="Artificial Evolution Laboratory">
      Artificial Evolution Laboratory
     </a>
     . During this time he also finds Gendo and Yui to be married, and with child. Although Kōzō's inquiry is cut short, the incident and it's subsequent cover-up becomes an obsession for him, and he continues to investigate on his own.
    </p>
    <p key="dd1c904e-6993-4ef8-a195-b1437fd8e553">
     He then confronted Gendo at the Artificial Evolution Laboratory with his findings. Gendo, unmoved by Fuyutsuki's threats of taking the information public, took him down into the

     and the under-construction facilities. Upon showing him the prototype

     unit, he invited Fuyutsuki to "join us in creating a new genesis for Mankind".
    </p>
    <p key="fe211b47-3581-4f47-bcfb-3d5085365539">
     Fuyutsuki subsequently joined

     , though it would appear that he had little choice in the matter. He confides in Yui that he was under threat of erasure by

    </p>
    <p key="76c254ce-cb68-4aaa-80f0-edd4843cafca">
     During the present of the series, Fuyutsuki is nearly always seen in the company of Gendo Ikari, but it is clear that their alliance is one of convenience and business. The two men do achieve some unity in that both are interested in seeing Yui again, however. It is unclear whether Gendo or Yui knew of Fuyutsuki’s attraction to her.

     At NERV, Fuyutsuki projects considerably less harsh of a personality than Gendo, confirmed when, after the disaster that was the initial attack on

He is tall—taller than Gendo—and always wears a dark reddish-brown buttonless uniform; this coupled with his stern yet calm, stoic demeanor makes him an imposing figure. If he is in command during combat, however, he projects a much more active style than Gendo's utter calm.

He alone appears to be aware of the extent Gendo's intentions with the

      Fuyutsuki's rank has been alternatively translated as "Vice Commander", "Deputy Commander", or "Sub-Commander", etc. The original Japanese word is fuku (as in fukushirei), and all of these alternate translations mean pretty much the same thing.
