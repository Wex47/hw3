     . In addition, he seems to maintain personal motivations beyond loyalty to any organization, and speaks frequently of his desire to "find the truth." Kaji can be said to have a

    <p key="46bb9d0f-7661-40a0-973f-b167e1bf5395">
     Most of the time, Kaji is very easygoing and jovial, always remaining cool and composed and maintaining his detached sense of humor even during times of crisis. He also flirts unabashedly with his female peers and coworkers, which further draws Misato's ire. Despite his irresponsible public persona, Kaji demonstrates a great level of personal responsibility and worldly wisdom in his personal interactions. He acts as something of a father figure to both Asuka and
     <a href="Shinji Ikari.html" key="a8060864-ceba-420f-992a-039d3a72b620" title="Shinji Ikari">

     , particularly the latter. Asuka is openly infatuated with him, something he coolly and repeatedly deflects.
     A common interpretation
     is to see Kaji as Shinji's positive adult mirror, with
     Gendo
     as a more negative model. Similarly,
     Misato
     and
     Ritsuko
     are mirrors for
     Asuka
     , as are their respective relationships. He offers Shinji contemplative advice and tries to help him understand the nature of social dynamics. Behind all of this, however, Kaji hints at being a very melancholic and lonely individual, plagued by doubts of his own sincerity and whether he is capable of true love. The only times during the series - including his death - in which Kaji seems to be truly sincere are during his philosophical discussions with Shinji and his dialogue with Misato in Episode 15.

     so that he can be interrogated. Kaji follows his orders, but disobeys SEELE by rescuing Fuyutsuki later and returning him to NERV. Prior to this, he remarks that his NERV I.D. card is the color of blood; also, during their last meeting, Kaji gives Misato a small capsule which contains the information for the

     , then says "This may be the last gift I give you." He then leaves Misato a farewell phone message, indicating that he knew he would likely be dead when she heard it. Fuyutsuki even remarks that his actions will cost him his life. Kaji is eventually shot and killed by an unknown assailant. In the anime, Kaji remarks to his killer, "You're a little late, aren't you?" which has led to debate among

      Evangelion
     </i>
     fans as to the identity of the killer, who is described in the episode Film-book as "a third party working either for SEELE or for NERV's Intelligence Division".
     The film-book also states that the killer was not a main character. This fan impression shocked Anno so much that it was directly addressed in the Director's Cut version of Episode 21, perhaps the single case of a clear-cut retcon in Eva.

    , Kaji and his brother were orphans and members of a group of children who united in order to survive the chaos. One day while stealing food from a JSDF facility, he was caught by soldiers, who threatened to kill him if he did not reveal the location of the gang's hideout. Kaji chose to betray his brother and friends, who were killed by the guards, and he has been plagued by guilt ever since. His role in the story is identical to that given in the anime, but there are a number of differences. He talks with Shinji and helps him to remember his mother's disappearance, and tells Shinji of his past to motivate Shinji to return to NERV after the fight against
    Bardiel
    (this takes place in a hidden supplies cellar rather than a watermelon patch). In the anime, Kaji is shot and killed by an unknown assailant; however, in the manga, it takes two shots, and Kaji chides the murderer for his poor aim. As he is dying, he sees the shadowy figures of his brother and friends and greets them.

      His family name, "Kaji" is written with the characters for 'increase' (加) and 'hold' (持) in Japanese. Kaji is named from the Japanese word for "rudder", forming a triad with
      Gendo
      and
      Shinji
      , whose surnames come from the words of other ship components, "anchor" (Ikari) and "sextant" (Rokubungi). His first name comes from the hero

      .
      Interestingly, he is never refered to by his first name, not even by Misato. His design, like that of Gendo and
      Fuyutsuki
      , comes from the TV series UFO, specifically Captain Foster.

      It is also the Japanese term for Adhiṣṭhāna, a form of divine guidance or assistance in Buddhism
      , possibly referring to his role as a supportive figure to both Shinji and Asuka. It is also somewhat of a departure from the Christianity / Judaism themes of the anime.

      Interestingly, Kaji in ANIMA combines aspects of Gendo from Rebuild (he wears Keel's visor whilst commander of NERV JPN, a step further extreme even from that incarnation of Gendo) and Keel Lorenz (he becomes deeply immersed in the secrets of SEELE and their true objectives with the planned Fourth Impact)

      In the game
      Secret of Evangelion
      , Ryoji Kaji was killed by
      Kyoya Kenzaki
      , his old friend.

      Misato's implied sex scene with Kaji in
      Episode:20
      was said by Anno to actually be a massage scene to TV Tokyo in order to get permission to air it.
      Misato had no line in the script, so Anno left it up to her voice actress Kotono Mitsuishi. The script simply gave her a note by Anno: Mitsuishi-sama, I look forward to working with you. Respectfully yours, Anno.
