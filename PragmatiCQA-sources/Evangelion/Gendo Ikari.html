     48 years old, Gendo has an appearance of a typical middle-aged man. He has a hair shape similar to Shinji's, but grows a lion's mane. His usual attire is a NERV black commander's uniform with gold lines sewn on the edges of the jacket, and green triangular identification pieces sewn at the sleeves and the necklace. Beneath the uniform, Gendo wears a red sweater. Other than his commander uniform, he rarely wears other outfits.

     Gendo wears a pair of white gloves to conceal his severely-burnt hands caused by the Unit-00 berserk incident. Gendo also wears a pair of glasses with squared lenses during that time, but later on changes to round-shaped-lenses glasses with a red or brown filter, which reflects light on large screens.

     Gendo does not seem to have any sort of interest in contrast with other NERV crew members, but has a habit of crossing his hands whenever he sits down, hiding his mouth. He is mostly calm and does not react visibly in alarming situations. He rarely smiles or laughs, but is however seen occasionally smiling at Rei, and one time during the battle against

She intended to bring about a brighter future for their son Shinji, whom Gendo has sacrificed in order to bring her back. In essence, Yui's dreams and principles were violated to resurrect her. Shortly after,

     is shown grasping Gendo in its hand before decapitating him, clearly rejecting Gendo's actions (however, this death sequence is questionable, due to its surreal appearance - though it is quite possible that he was turned to LCL like everyone else, the vision of Eva-01 being just a manifestation of his self-loathing). As he's dying, Gendo admits he avoided Shinji because he was just as afraid of hurting him as Shinji was of him, and thought it bas better to do nothing at all. Taking into account other actions he did before, like faint praise of Shinji and attempt to spare him using the Dummy Plug system, Gendo is shown to still care for Shinji, but is extremely hesitant and insecure about it, and prefers to keep the distance between them in order to avoid being hurt. In this manner, he is very similar to his son.
     A common interpretation
     is to see Gendo as Shinji's negative adult mirror, with

     Gendo Ikari was born as Gendo Rokubungi (六分儀, meaning sextant).

He and Yui were married at the beginning of the 21st century, wherein he changed his surname to Ikari. (This is the practice of mukoyoshi, where a man is adopted into a family through marriage in order to carry on the family's surname. It should also be noted that this detail is not revealed until later in the series.) In 2001 their son Shinji was born. They both worked together at

A vision of Yui confronts him as he lays dying, asking him to remember the first time he felt love for Shinji. After confessing that he has only caused his son pain, Gendo remembers Shinji as a newborn baby—the first time he felt love for him, and realizes that what Yui wanted (through the Evangelion project) was a better world for them to live in as a family. He thus redeems his soul in his final moments.

     , Gendo is shown in a humorous light, much unlike his anime counterpart. His antics, oftentimes embarrassing Shinji, often end with him being hit by Yui. During a blackout at NERV, he shined his torch in a scary way, which promptly earned him a smack from Yui. Another time, Gendo is reading a newspaper when Yui asks him if he told Shinji something (like she told Gendo to do). Gendo's response was to sweat and shake nervously and the scene ends with the sound effect of Yui hitting Gendo. Gendo is also shown to be a rather charismatic figure during this time, moving several members of NERV staff (notably all male) to aid with the "pedaling for power" plan.

     fandom is parodied here, as both men decided to "compete" to see who could pedal the fastest. The contest was actually a way to generate electricity for NERV HQ, which had been hit by a blackout. The incident also pays homage to the original anime, where Gendo helps in the manual launching of the EVAs against the invading Angel. Interestingly, both Fuyutsuki and Rei were shown to put in their share of work before dropping out due to fatigue.

     At the start of the manga, Gendo is stated to be overseas, having left Shinji in the care of Ryoji Kaji. About halfway through the story, Gendo is revealed to be behind NERV, the organization fighting the Angels. Shinji notes that something is amiss, as Gendo acts far colder and distant than he did when Shinji was a boy. At the story's climax, it is revealed that this Gendo is a doppelganger from an alternate universe, who came to this one as part of an ill-fated attempt to replace his universe's Yui following her death. After discovering that this universe's Gendo had been killed in a lab accident (the same one that resulted in Yui becoming trapped in the Tree of Y'ggdrasil), the alternate Gendo took his place.

     He initially plans to have Rei Ayanami take Yui's place in the tree (thus freeing her), but the plan changes after Rei becomes fond of Shinji and refuses to give up her own existence. Gendo shoots Rei for her betrayal and attempts to use Shinji as a replacement, but is ultimately killed by falling debris from Y'ggdrasil, implied to have been caused by Yui.

     In fact, Anno's father seemed to have influenced

     Anno said that Gendo was simply based on himself, and Nerv as a metaphor for Gainax itself, with him at the helm, but also subordinate to TV Tokyo's executives, represented by Seele.
     He likened him to his Jungian shadow, a comparison he made only with

     Initially, he wanted to bring about a "digitized human", and his goals were more sincere in pursuing Instrumentality itself rather than reuniting with Yui.
     In the original end, he'd have a scene separating himself from Shinji and yelling to him, "Live!", recalling Nemo from Anno's previous
