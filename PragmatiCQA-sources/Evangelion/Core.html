   , serving as the primary power organ. In Angels and some Evas, the core contains an
   <a href="S² Engine.html" key="c5cd8b05-3618-4fd5-b24c-b6bcda98bbec" title="S² Engine">
    S² Engine
   </a>
   , as well. The core is (typically) the only vital point of Angels and Evas; unless it is sufficiently damaged, these entities can receive inordinate amounts of damage without truly dying. In those Evas that do not possess an S² Engine, the core still serves as the primary power organ, but it is only capable of supplying limited power without an S² Engine.

  <p key="92a4cb31-c60c-45f3-b1dd-9d801f6a2f15">
   A core is very hard and somewhat resistant to damage, though a solid strike from a
   Progressive Knife
   is enough to destroy one. Physically, cores are actually fairly brittle, and when damaged shards chip off and the core fractures, visually behaving like crystalline material.
  </p>
  <p key="a654a464-5f56-4419-80fd-cafee6a754ec">
   The core appears to uniformly serve as a container for the
   soul
   of the Angel or Eva. This is the reason it is the only true vulnerable point of an Angel; so long as the Core exists, the Angel can still project it's A.T. Field and therefore repair any damage to its physical body.
