     The relevance of the card texts to Eva interpretation have been
     and
     . It should be noticed that Cardass was released in 1996 and is thus one of the earliest known sources to provide information on several things. It's understandable they might seem dubious at first as they're not a guidebook proper. However, it's clear they're a sort of informational material and not just a game contained to a separate continuity: unlike material for videogames and spin-off manga, their descriptions concern themselves strictly with canon events, and not any "what-if" or alternate scenarios. They match more comprehensive later sources like the

     Before the game begins, each player must choose 30 cards to use for their deck, ala Magic the Gathering. More than 30 cards can be used, but one angel must be included for every 15 cards in the deck. The cards are then shuffled and placed in front.

     The first thing you do is choose a Level 1 Consummation card. A Consummation card is a specific goal related to a character that must be achieved before going onto the next stage and/or winning the game. Place this card face up in front of you. Next, the 6 character cards are placed in a pentagon formation (henceforth called Neo-Tokyo), starting from the top moving clockwise:

     The basic anatomy of cards are as follows. The top left states what type of card it is. The top right +/- number is the draw point number used for the Ending Draw Phase. The center body is fairly straightforward as it explains the card effects. The bottom contents of the card relates to the Line Card, which is explained below.

      EVA Cards: These cards are used principally to fight the angels. If the corresponding pilot is downed (flipped over) in Neo-Tokyo (see Line Cards), then that Evangelion cannot be used. They can only be spoken (played) in the Main Phase.

      PUT cards are literally put onto a character or Evangelion card and include a variety of events or rule changes to the game. No more than two may be placed on any character. They may only be used in the Main Phase.

      DRAMA cards refer to the unfolding events surrounding Neo-Tokyo and its 6 main characters. They can be used in the Opening Draw Phase and the Main Phase. Their effects only last 1 turn, however.
     </li>
    </ul>

      LINE cards are used when all cards other than consummation and angel cares are turned upside down. Line cards are used to hurt or attract characters in Neo-Tokyo. Here, a line is spoken aloud by the player and the character is either attracted to another character/character group, or is downed. The geometric symbols underneath the line are called Line Marks and they indicate if a character can be attracted or hurt. Triangles represent hurt and circles represent attract. The color of the triangle or circle reflects the color of the character card. Players can choose only one Line Mark per Line Card to use on a character. Each line card is worth 1 DP, except those spoken by Rei Ayanami, which are worth 0 DP. Line Cards can only be spoken in the Main Phase by the active player.

      ANGEL cards are of course the enemies of the game. Each angel has a given strength, represented by a number on the lower right of the card. To defeat an angel, the total strength of the Evangelions must exceed the strength of an angel. A tie in strength will result in a defeat for the Evangelions.

    </h3>
    <p key="e0593c3a-5843-4955-8e21-ad8f0d44f876">
     The main object of the game is to reach the objective as listed on the consummation cards. There are 2 levels of these. Once the second level is passed, the player may call a Consummation Stage (but doesn't have to). This can only be done at the Consummation Phase during the active player's turn.
    </p>
    <p key="3e30931d-c085-455e-8926-336f0dfb1a50">
     This Stage works as follows. Only Line cards are used. The object is to attract the character corresponding to the character on the consummation card. Other non-active players may hurt the character in response, but if they do not react during this first counter-attack, they will not be able to play a line card for the rest of this stage. As the Stage progresses, if the active player plays a Line card that attracts, but is not countered by any Line card that hurts, the active player wins the game.
