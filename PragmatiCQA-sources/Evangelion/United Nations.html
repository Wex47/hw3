    Second Impact
   </a>
   in 2000. Following the global ecological disaster and subsequent political upheaval, internal reorganizations made the UN heavily militarized, and it now actively deploys military forces across the globe. The militias of both the Western and Eastern power blocs were put under the UN's direct command after Second Impact.
   NERV
   is officially a special agency under the UN's control. Secretly, the UN is controlled by the global power cabal maintained by the

   ). Indeed, in
   Episode 08
   the UN Pacific Fleet's commanding officer openly lamented that the UN's forces had become a "delivery service," for NERV.

   A newspaper from 2002, seen in
   Episode 21
   , announces "UN moves headquarters to Japan in 5 years: Candidate City is Tokyo-2." Thus, it would seem that due to the chaos caused by Second Impact, UN headquarters was moved from New York City to Tokyo-2.
