This "contact" was apparently physical, and resulted in DNA "diving" into Adam and "physically fusing" resulting in Adam's soul being transferred into the body of Kaworu and Adam's body being reduced to an Embryonic state.

    Even with the scarcity of information on the first contact experiment, it seems to be inherently different from the two that followed in that it was the only known attempt to separate an Angel's soul from it's body and combine this soul with Lilin genes while the others exclusively involved Lilin souls being separated and combined with Adams genes.

    In ADV's Platinum translation of
    Episode 21
    ', a Katsuragi Team member's line is furnished as, "The DNA that was inserted into Adam is already physically fused!" This is misleading, however: The Japanese clearly says that the DNA "dived" (
    <i key="ba6e5bc7-80da-42fa-8ae0-bb18e5cb6fcf">

    ). However, since the concept of DNA "diving" of its own accord makes no apparent sense, ADV's Shoko Ono may have attempted to reinterpret the line into something that did.
