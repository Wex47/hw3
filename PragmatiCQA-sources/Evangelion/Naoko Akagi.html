     After the disappearance of Yui, she began a relationship with Gendo, however this was short lived. When confronted by Rei I, the girl told her of Gendo's true opinion of her.

     Naoko has the same good-natured but distant relationship with her daughter that Ritsuko has with others. Naoko has even admitted to leaving Ritsuko on her own for too long; she blames Ritsuko’s difficulty with men on this, and admits to herself that she acted like a mother only when it was convenient. Despite being very aware of her faults, there is no sign that Naoko ever tried to change them.
    </p>
    <p key="1be65c95-2918-4ea3-80de-cb7e5b1f647a">
     Naoko was sexually involved with Gendo Ikari after the death of
     <a href="Yui Ikari.html" key="fa0a30b3-a0f6-480d-80ec-3a884dc84d0f" title="Yui Ikari">
      Yui Ikari
     </a>
     , though it is suggested that Naoko wanted Gendo before, as she described Yui’s disappearance as being exactly what she’d hoped for. Naoko seemed to accept that Gendo couldn’t forget about Yui and perhaps also that Gendo would have no deep attachment to her as a consequence.
    </p>
    <p key="ade1668f-3c6c-4c68-ba51-9b5541bb0755">
     However, Naoko still strangled the first

     </a>
     when the child said that Gendo considered Naoko as an "old hag" and no longer useful (Rei’s resemblance to Yui might also have been a factor, as Yui’s face appears superimposed over Rei 1’s as she speaks to Naoko). This might indicate that Naoko was more strongly attached to Gendo than she appeared, enough to kill at the thought of his rejection, though sheer anger over being discarded might also have been part of Naoko’s motivation.
    </p>
    <p key="40ec1321-418a-4b25-9832-0410d7625101">
     Naoko then died from a fall from the top of
     Central Dogma
     onto the Magi computers below. It is unknown if someone assassinated Naoko, though there is no suggestion of this. From the look of horror on her face after strangling Rei it seems that she was horrified enough at what she had done to take her own life (the manga adaptation by
     Yoshiyuki Sadamoto
     explicitly shows that Naoko committed suicide).

     When Ritsuko Akagi tried to self-destruct the Magi in
     Episode 25'
     , Casper-3, the "woman" aspect, rejected the command. The shocked Ritsuko interpreted this as Naoko choosing Gendo over her own daughter.
