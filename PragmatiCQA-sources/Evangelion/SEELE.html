   (the progenitor of humanity), Adam's seed was inactivated, so SEELE views Humanity as the false successors of Earth, and the Angels as the true successors, the sons of God, and for that Humanity is burdened by the "Original Sin" because it should never have existed. They work to destroy the Angels, then unite all humanity as one and sequentially unite with Lilith and Adam, so that they can become part of the God—the next stage of existence.

   SEELE's original plan to accomplish this was to make Kaworu the Seventeenth Angel, the carrier of Adam's soul, merge with Lilith, causing the Third Impact. This would, with the help of thirteen

   The death of Kaworu made SEELE conclude that Kaworu wasn't the "successor of life" after all. This was further justified by the Dead Sea Scrolls, since it didn't foresee anything of this. SEELE agreed, from there on, that they wouldn't borrow the power of the angels anymore to help accomplish their plans.

The Book of Revelation is rife with apocalyptic imagery, but it's commonly believed among Protestants that the seventh and final seal represents the Rapture, where those deemed worthy would rise into heaven to be with God while those deemed unworthy would die below on Earth. This concept closely mirrors SEELE's goals.
