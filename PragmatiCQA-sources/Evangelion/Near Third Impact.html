   and the land surrounding it have been devastated by impact craters and upheaval, and everything is coated with a blood-red substance. Massive red cross structures dot the surface, and inert red Eva-like entities are littered throughout the area, in many cases melded together in various formations. Enormous fissures also scar the land, one of which resembles a kilometers-long mouth complete with giant teeth.

   In addition, Third Impact or a related cataclysm had a dramatic effect on the Moon. Its orbit has been altered, bringing it much closer to Earth, and it is no longer tidally-locked with Earth. The Moon also seems to have gained an atmosphere of some kind, as cloud formations are visible. Lastly, red grid lines and splatters cover the Moon's surface (some of the splatters were present previously, as evidenced by views of
   Tabgha Base
   , although a full view of the Moon seen in the post-credits scene of

   Kaworu states that these are the product of mankind attempting artificial evolution. The blood stained Earth itself has become uninhabitable for humans as a result. Ritsuko's words imply that if the Third Impact had continued, the event would have exterminated all life on Earth.
