   of an Eva Unit, containing its cockpit, is completely flooded with LCL, and, because it is oxygenated,
   upon being submerged Eva pilots can "breathe" the liquid (similar to real-life experiments involving
   liquid breathing
   ).

  <p key="005d5fe8-39c9-40c1-8f76-20eb3ecbdfb4">
   Upon Evangelion activation, an electrical current is run through the LCL and it undergoes a "phase shift", after which its density, opacity, and viscosity appear to approach that of air. However, the LCL remains in a liquid phase and does not undergo a transition: the pilots appear to be surrounded by air, however occasionally air bubbles will float away from their mouths, revealing that they are still in a liquid medium.

  <p key="2b72e9ec-1423-4ad3-8f30-54403747cec3">
   When an Eva activates, the pilot is totally submerged in LCL in the entry plug. The LCL acts as a mediator allowing the pilot's nervous system to electro-chemically directly interface with the nervous system of an Eva. The greater the degree of interfacing between an Eva and its pilot's minds, the higher the "synch ratio" between the two.

    The real-world version of LCL as a breathable liquid is a class of chemicals called
    perfluorocarbons
    or PFCs. At least 5 different PFCs are in different stages of testing for liquid breathing:
    perflubron
    ,
    perfluorodecalin
    ,
    perfluorohexane
    ,
    perfluorooctane
    , and
    FC-75
    , with perflubron and perfluorohexane both having been tested successfully on humans (perflubron used to help prematurely born infants breathe, and perfluorohexane used to help burn victims breathe). PFCs, most notably perfluorodecalin, are also used as blood substitutes to deliver oxygen to the cells of people who have lost blood if a blood transfusion is not available. Notable differences they have from LCL are they are clear instead of orange or red, they are twice as dense as water instead of less dense, they do not become ionized, and even if they were part of the primordial soup of life they were just a minor part of it.

    The real-world version of LCL as the "primordial ooze" is the
    primordial soup of life
    that was first briefly mentioned as a "warm little pond" by Charles Darwin in his book On the Origin of Species in 1859, developed into a complete theory for the origins of life in 1924 by Alexander Oparin, and then duplicated in a lab in 1953 in the
    Miller–Urey experiment
    . In that experiment, 4 simple chemicals (water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen) were used to create a variety of amino acids. Those amino acids are the building blocks for proteins and for all life on Earth, even more fundamental to life than DNA or RNA (in fact DNA and RNA are simply codes for which amino acids to assemble in what order to construct proteins). Subsequent similar experiments have produced a wider array of chemical building blocks of life including the nucleotides from which DNA and RNA are composed, confirming these results.

    Due to its orange color, LCL is often referred to as
    Tang™
    , an orange juice drink, by fans. Instead of saying, "reverting to LCL," fans will often say, that a "(character) was Tanged", calling the process "Tangification", etc. The color of LCL was changed to blood red instead of orange for

    LCL is definitely an abbreviation for something: other words in the series spelled using all-capital letters such as "NERV", "Gehirn", and "SEELE" are not acronyms, but instead were simply spelled using all-capitals as a quirk of translation. "LCL", however, is confirmed to be an abbreviation because it is sometimes seen spelled as "L.C.L." on computer displays, though simply "LCL" is much more common.
