   . However, it has several (if minor) aesthetic differences. While it mostly maintains the green, purple and black color scheme, the green highlights are much less prominent, replaced with a few pale yellow ones on its knees and forearms and a much higher spread of purple and black across its body. The purple is deeper in colour compared to Unit-01. Also the entirety of its body has more detailed and segmented plates across it, and the armor in its legs has been completely redesigned, with slightly wider, almost square-shaped hips, larger knee pads and heel-like foot covers. Its helmet design still retains the ceratoid dinosaur-like appearance, though in a much more detailed fashion, its horn is designed in

   way and it has four glowing, bright yellow eyes, with equally colored lines coming from each eye. Another key difference, is the black, cross-shaped chest piece, with two red circles on top with no visible core-piece.
  </p>
  <p key="82867490-19ab-481a-923f-efdbe2bd1e17">
   Another major difference compared to other Eva units is Evangelion 13's massive size, as it towered over Unit-02'γ, with the latter reaching the former's elbows in height at best.
  </p>
  <p key="56542322-8189-446d-a905-79edde631024">
   When entering in its Awakened state, its eyes and various highlights turn red, its center piece collapses and unveils a second set of arms. After being devoured by the
   Twelfth Angel
   , its pylons explode, revealing two crystallized wing-like appendages.
  </p>
  <p key="765857ae-cb7a-4d28-abcf-f9e2786f9d24">
   The Evangelion is also able to perform pseudo-evolution (the term is mentioned by Mari), similar to when Unit-01 goes into an awakened state when confronting the Tenth Angel. The eyes of the Evangelion enlarge, and the mouth opens to reveal a set of teeth. After engulfing the Twelfth Angel, the whole body of Evangelion 13 turns into glowing-white, except for that the red decals on her chest turns green. Then, the crystal wing-like appendages extend further to lengths similar to the height of an Evangelion. It assumes the appearance of a giant of light, similar to Unit-01 and the Adams, and manifests two Halos. The Halos grow vertically, unlike the way it grows on Unit-01's head. Evangelion 13's two halos represent two souls: Kaworu and Shinji, while that of Unit-01 represents one: specifically Shinji Ikari. However, it should be noted that Evangelion 13 awakes under its own will, but not Shinji's like in

   In pseudo-evolution state, Evangelion 13 is able to withstand a full ram from the AAA Wunder unharmed when Misato attempts to seal Evangelion 13 inside an AT-field and blast the Evangelion with full power.
  </p>
  <p key="c3ed2027-abc9-4b1c-8ed0-d34a5ccfaf0d">
   When Kaworu impales the two Spears of Longinus into Evangelion 13 and he is killed by the activation of the DSS choker, Evangelion 13's eyes reduce back to normal, and the two pair of eyes merge into one pair. However, the Evangelion still remains in pseudo-evolution state until Mari forcefully ejects Shinji's entry plug from the unresponsive Evangelion.

   Unlike other Evangelion units, Evangelion 13 has displayed several unique features. One of its more prominent ones is that it requires the use of two

    Entry Plugs

   (as two souls are necessary to wield this Eva and two Spears at the same time). Though it requires two pilots, its control system can be changed to give full control to a single pilot. Its physical strength is also noteworthy, as it was able to overpower and toss Unit-02' around despite the fact that Shinji was fighting defensively against Asuka. Another interesting fact it that it does not appear to have any energy cable or battery of any kind, attached to it, implying that this unit must be powered by an

  <p key="d6a3e3b8-bdec-4476-9d0a-7e15bce90427">
   Also, unique to Evangelion 13 is that it does not possess any
   A.T. Field
   at all like the other Eva or the Angels (as demonstrated when Unit-08 shot it with a special
   Anti-A.T. Field Ammunition
   ; Evangelion 13 deployed no A.T. Field and instead the bullets disintegrated on contact with its body). Instead, four drones housed in the containers of the Eva's shoulder pylons (two containers on each shoulder pylon) generate an energy barrier very similar to an A.T. Field. These jellyfish-like drones, called "RS Hoppers",
   can either be used as either defensive or offensive weapons, depending on the situation. The velocity of a RS Hopper is also noticeably high. The RS Hoppers explode violently when destroyed. This unit also has an extra set of fully functional arms, kept locked across its chest, that can be released and gives this Eva the physical strength required to wield two Spears. Like the other Adams, it has the ability to fire beams of light but much more powerful.

   . The unit itself is much more resilient to damage, able to withstand a full assault from the
   AAA Wunder
   , Unit-02' and Unit-08, with virtually no damage. It's also much more difficult to stop the Evangelion in this state than it was with Unit-01, as it took it being stabbed with both Spears of Longinus, and having both its pilots disabled before it was finally deactivated.

    The unit makes a reappearance in the film, during
    Operation Yamato
    . It first appears on a cross, apparently dormant in the middle of a lake of LCL. Asuka then tries to destroy it, but an A.T. Field prevents her from doing so. Asuka then realizes, since Evangelion 13 does not possess its own A.T. Field, that the A.T. Field is actually coming from Unit-02, apparently "afraid" of Evangelion 13. She then forcefully tries to break her A.T. Field, to no avail. She then forcefully removes her eye patch, resulting in her becoming the remains of the Ninth Angel and merging with her Evangelion in order to destroys it's A.T. Field. However, as soon as she does this, Evangelion 13 activates and destroys Unit-02, as well as its entry plug, absorbing Asuka in the process and her angelic powers.

    Later on, Gendo reveals the true purpose of Evangelion 13: To use it on Minus Space to resurrect Yui. He then willingly fuses with it, making him the primary soul and controller of the Eva. He, along with Evangelion 13, then go inside Minus Space.

    Shinji pilots then Unit-01 and duels Gendo in Evangelion 13 inside a Minus Space, and is a fight involving the Spear of Cassius and the Spear of Longinus. The fight consists of multiple settings throughout the series, including Tokyo-3, Misato's Apartment, Rei's Apartment, Shinji's Classroom, outside the Geo-front, Kaji's melon patch, and on the ruined beaches of Tokyo-3. This is due to the fact Minus Space can't be perceived by humans normally, so it utilizes pre-existing memories as a setting. However, during the battle, Shinji and Gendo realize that the fight isn't going anywhere, and resolve to talk about their issues with each other.

    During the finale, as Shinji is about to sacrifice himself to rebuild the world, the souls of Gendo and Yui interrupt him from doing so. Gendo destroys all of the Evangelion Units with the Spear of Gaius piercing Unit-01 and Evangelion 13 to remove everything related to Evangelion.

    It seems that the numerical designation of this Evangelion, 13, was eerily prophetic, as the 13th Arcana is death, and this is the Evangelion in which Kaworu dies.
   </li>
   <li key="14e819d8-16bc-4d23-b975-97825abf789f">
    Biblically, the number 13 refers to Judas Iscariot, the betrayer of Jesus Christ. After killing Jesus, Judas ends his life by suicide, which resonates with the fact that Evangelion 13 impaled itself with lances of Longinus (which was used to impale the waist of crucified Jesus) and that Kaworu killed himself with the DSS Choker.

   <li key="250cec1b-ab27-4fbe-b1a6-af9a3af39530">
    The Entry Plug sound effect of both Evangelion 13 and Mark.06 is different from all other Evas with Evangelion 13's Entry Plug emitting a straight low monotonic hum, seemingly due to the fact that Evangelion 13 is created based on the Mark series.

    Evangelion 13 does not physically have hatches for entry plugs like other standard Evangelion units. The entry plugs enter by being "absorbed" into the unit. The red dots on its back are the positions where the entry plugs are inserted.
