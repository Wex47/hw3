   to NERV's 2nd Branch in Nevada to complete the construction of Unit 4. However, due to interference from the angel Leliel, the Unit's S2 Engine malfunctioned, causing a Dirac Sea which destroyed the entire facility within an 89 kilometer radius and killed several thousand workers. After this event, the United States removed Unit-3 from its storage at NERV's First Branch in Massachusetts and sent it by cargo jet to Japan. Unfortunately, Unit 3 was hijacked by the hidden angel Bardiel over the Pacific in transit.

   The United States was one of the few nations with an economy large and complex enough (aside from Japan and Germany) to be capable of building an Evangelion Unit. During 2015 it seems the country was undergoing an economic crisis as evidenced by high unemployment rates. While the Country was a powerful member of the United Nations Council, the U.S. Congress was still obstinate to contribute to the funding of additional Eva Units beyond Unit 5. However, Congress was concerned about the ongoing unemployment crisis and agreed to help fund on the condition Unit 6 was also built in the U.S. to create jobs for citizens. The U.S. maintained a large manufacturing sector, particularly in the aerospace division. The country also had a strong computer industry and possessed a Magi System at NERV's First Branch at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

   The United States contributed to the bulk of the United Nations' military force after the Second Impact. The UN Pacific Fleet was composed of five aircraft carriers and two battleships built before the Second Impact. The U.S. Navy had moved its Pacific Fleet Headquarters to New Yokosuka.
