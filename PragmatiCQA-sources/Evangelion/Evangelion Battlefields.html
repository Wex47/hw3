   The core gameplay is the same for all modes; the player, who has a team of two pilots and two Evas, is placed into a circular arena. They must select weapons from their Eva's equipped arsenal, with three weapons to select from shown at any given time. They will then attack, and their "WP" (weapon points) will decrease in accordance with the cost of firing the chosen weapon. WP will regenerate automatically throughout the battle, but can also be regenerated manually by the player charging. The player is able to run in circles around the edge of the arena to dodge enemy attacks. In the some modes, they can also bring the combat into close-quarters by charging at the enemy, which unlocks their melee weaponry; these same modes also allow the player to use a powerful attack called

   Resource buildings generate items which are used to upgrade all buildings on the map. Episode buildings generate episodes for the player at certain intervals after they've fought in battles. Armament buildings provide external attacks and defense that can aide the player during battle. The AAA Wunder map only contains episode buildings.

   Standard episodes have very little continuous story, instead mostly serving to showcase small conversations between the characters. Cross episodes are parts of bigger storylines that pertain to primarily two characters' relationship with each other. These episodes can be read in semi-chronological order from the

   (回想, "kaisou") option on the main menu. Reading episodes as they generate on the map will give the player currency, resources and gameplay buffs. Most episodes are basic text-based sections that show character icons alongside textboxes, somewhat akin to a visual novel, but cross episodes prior to Season 4 have three fully animated 3D cutscenes each. Battle stories are episodes that come from the mode of the same name, and focus more on the overarching plot than the earlier episodes do.

   Pilots have a number of stats, including attack power, speed, stamina and defense. These stats are increased by levelling up and evolving the pilot. Levelling up is done through earning EXP in Battlefields mode, or through using LCL. Ranking up increases the stats significantly more than levelling up does, and can only be done through using character tokens and coins. The current level cap is Level 75, the rank cap being Rank 6.

By default, only four containers earned for free can be held at one time, and they can take up to two hours to open. Containers which are bought with gems will open immediately.
