    </h2>
    <p key="8432fd7c-f6bc-4e68-a230-85fc65cb86b8">
     Shinji initially shows a passive and laid-back personality, inheriting such traits from his relaxed life with his sensei. When he is told to pilot Unit-01, he denies, not wanting to do it. Though Shinji denies it, he yearns for praise, and he eventually begins to pilot Unit-01 to gain the approval and love from his father. He also continually tells himself "I mustn't run away!",
     further demonstrating his need to move forward and let go of the past.
    </p>
    <p key="4fb6c422-c2ce-4d28-b938-431057e60cf4">
     Shinji shows a great fear of emotional pain and of being hated or left behind, likely due to his perception of being abandoned in his youth and, subsequently, blaming himself for not being good enough to make his father stick around. In general, Shinji is shown to be introverted and disconnected from physical reality due to having little to no meaningful contact with others. In social party situations, he is shown to be quite uncomfortable, and he often has difficulty controlling his emotions around others due to his hard time letting go of the past. He is shown to the extreme of this, forsaking many lives (even his own) to save one person.
    </p>
    <p key="4f3a5275-9c9a-4f9a-8921-a2da59a88e8d">
     Due to Shinji's high nostalgia and fragile emotional state, he chooses to shut out the world, as evidenced by the headphones he wears rather often, plugged into an SDAT music player. He usually plays tracks 25 ("You Are the Only One") and 26 ("Blue Legend"), though in episodes
     02
     and
     23
     , the songs are varied to different background music and vocals.

    Shinji has medium-length straight brown hair and grey-blue eyes. Shinji is also very skinny, and often has his shirt tucked in, showing that he is a rather tidy person. When spending time at NERV or out in the city, he wears his uniform which is a white dress shirt, blue t-shirt, dark pants and white sneakers, though when in his apartment, he will often wear something more casual. Shinji's plug suit has a very light blue torso, complemented by the rest being a dark blue color with black portions as well.

     NERV

Soon thereafter, Ritsuko has Shinji return Rei's ID card to her; Shinji accidentally walks in on Rei as she is getting dressed, and clumsily knocks her to the floor, touching her naked body. A bit shook up, Shinji follows Rei to NERV, returns her ID card, and asks her about his father; when he tells her that he has no faith in Gendo, she slaps him.

When Ramiel fights back, Rei, in Unit-00, steps between them, taking heavy damage. Shinji then destroys Ramiel with another blast. Shinji quickly escapes Unit-01, and opens Unit-00's hatch, burning his hands as Gendo did in the past, to see Rei. He expresses a deep sadness for her but tells her to smile nonetheless.

Kaji and Misato devise a plan to take down the Angel after it heals and returns in a few days time; however, the plan requires the cooperation of both Evangelion units.

    Gendo abandoned Shinji shortly after Yui disappeared into Unit-01, sending him to live with his sensei. Shinji resents Gendo for this, despite having run away from Gendo the last time they spoke, three years before, the last time they visited Yui's grave.
    In
    Episode 01
    , Shinji shows Misato the letter his father sent, summoning him to Tokyo-3. The entirety of the letter is blanked out, except for the handwritten words, "Come. — Gendo Ikari".

     Nonetheless, Shinji still longs for words of praise from Gendo.
     He never understood his father's motives (neither did anyone else, except perhaps
     Fuyutsuki
     ) until the very end of the series—at the same time as Gendo realizes Yui's. Gendo, in
     Episode 21
     , resembles Shinji even more strongly and reveals he is used to being hated and alone. He can be seen as a kind of negative adult mirror of Shinji, in contrast to
     Kaji
     , as Gendo reveals in
     End of Evangelion
     that he resents not being able to connect with Shinji and was afraid of hurting him, so he chose to shut himself away from Shinji, as he believed that when he was close to Shinji he only hurt him, so Gendo thought it was better to do nothing at all, just like Shinji shut himself away from other people, as Gendo believed he wasn't worthy of love. He apologizes to Shinji as he accepts his "punishment".

    Despite a rocky start, Shinji's relationship with Misato becomes one of his strongest connections. Though they are slow to admit it, they understand each other well due to each being aware of the insecurities of the other. Their interpersonal problems stem from their fear of losing those they love, and though Misato tries to help Shinji understand that life involves both joy and pain, she herself struggles with the same fear. Shinji's fraught relationship with his father mirrors Misato's with her own, and each understands the feelings of abandonment and isolation that plague them, albeit with differing outcomes. When

    and Shinji is horrified when she offers her body to him, seeing her as a mother figure.
    As his "boss"/NERV Chief Tactical Officer, Misato can be quite intense, causing Shinji to not come home at night more than once, though they always reconcile. Shinji comes to admire Misato's resolve in combat situations—something which often serves to fuel his own dire confidence, leading him to disobey her orders on certain occasions.

Shinji, for much of the earlier parts of the story, wants Misato to always praise him, and while she is quick to do so when Shinji shows prowess and courage, she also criticizes him when he acts recklessly and goes against orders. Initially, this frustrates Shinji, but it is through Misato's prodding over the length of the series that Shinji comes to realize why he pilots the Eva, as she has much influence in helping him develop a greater sense of responsibility and maturity.

In the manga adaptation, it is unclear how much of the story Shinji remembers (if any at all) after he rejects Instrumentality, but in the very last panel, he is shown going off confidently into the future with Misato's cross pendant (which she gave to him just before she died saving him) tied to his suitcase.

     Shinji is attracted to Asuka,
     though the reasoning is not explicitly stated.
     It might be that her bullying sometimes causes Shinji to bite back at her, as Asuka wants his attention, and he views Asuka, in a strange fashion, as a source of strength, one that he misses when Asuka is laid low by her encounter with
     Arael
     . However, Shinji directly expresses his feelings for Asuka by trying to kiss her as she sleeps,
     when he masturbated at the accidental exposure of the then-comatose girl's breasts,
     and in the
     Episode 26
     Instrumentality sequence when he says "I want to help you somehow and be with you forever.", and Asuka states she wants Shinji all to herself and that she is not only aware of his masturbation at the hospital, but also implies that it is, in fact, a habit of his.
     In
     Episode 22
     , Asuka laments that Shinji "won't do anything, won't help me, won't even hold me.",
     revealing Asuka's frustrations at Shinji not picking up on her advances, particularly earlier in
     Episode 9
     and their kiss in
     Episode 15
     , despite him barely understanding them.
     Asuka also seems very jealous of Shinji's interactions with

     to validate her as an adult, as she starts to begrudgingly accept Shinji's piloting prowess and to find an equal in him, something she is unwilling to do with Rei. After
     Episode 16
     however when Shinji surpasses her synch scores, she starts resenting his success as in her view, Shinji hasn't worked for it whereas Asuka spent her whole life training for piloting Eva and she is unsure of how to deal with not being the best. Asuka's expectations for Shinji as a strong male, that she used to project on Kaji, clash with the reality of him as a "housebroken male", despite him being much more than that: Asuka believes Shinji is unwilling to help her, in combat or otherwise, despite him showing bravery even without request - like when he rescued her from the volcano in Episode 10. Additionally, Asuka interprets Shinji's inaction during their kiss in Episode 15 not as lack of understanding, fear or insecurity, but as conscious rejection, which she greatly resents.

     Despite Asuka's own abrasiveness toward Shinji, she develops a rather skewed mentorship with him. It is her constant battling, coupled with her seemingly unquenchable energy, that often gives Shinji strength and confidence he didn't know he had. During the days that they lived in a furnished room at NERV HQ practicing their dance routine, Shinji began to understand where Asuka was coming from and allowed himself to confide a little in her. In the end, it was her perfectionism which awakened Shinji's confidence, allowing them to synchronize and defeat
     Israfel
     . Asuka's ambivalence regarding their mutual feelings often confuses Shinji, leaving him unsure as to what he feels for her, as Asuka, in order to avoid intimacy forming between them, sometimes reverts to her self-defense mechanisms, and pushes Shinji away, even if Shinji seems barely affected by those, as per his passive nature he seems content to merely have her attention.

They meet again in the ending of the manga, when Asuka is stuck in a crowd and Shinji pulls her hand, and they seem to have a faint memory of each other and some sort of lingering feelings. Sadamoto conceived their dance training in the manga as akin to a "kiss", underlining their psychological connection, in place of kiss scene in
     Episode 15

He is certain nobody cares about him. Asuka comments on his masturbation earlier in the hospital, and implies it is in fact a habit of his. Asuka gives him an ultimatum, demanding him give herself to her, but Shinji is unwilling to give back any affection himself, much like Asuka herself is, and believes nobody is nice to him, which Asuka and other characters disagree, but Shinji doesn't believe it. Shinji desperately asks for Asuka's affection and even proclaims he wants to be with her forever, but Asuka refuses, as she is unwilling to serve as just an emotional crutch and escape to him. This causes him to lash out at her, and he begins choking Asuka. However,
    after he rejects

    but instead of reacting with aggression or hostility, Asuka caresses Shinji gently (similarly to how Yui had done a few minutes earlier in the movie) which stops him as this first open act of compassion demonstrates to Shinji that he might be accepted after all.
    Overwhelmed, Shinji begins to cry. It is left open where their relationship will go from there.

    Shinji first encounters Rei at the Nerv HQ in
    Episode 1
    , after being summoned by his father regarding the oncoming Angel attack. Despite being heavily injured, Rei insists on piloting the Eva when Shinji protests against getting in the robot, eventually forcing him to face his responsibility. She is shown as a practical and mysterious figure, acting solely on commands and refusing all social contact. Shinji is initially puzzled at Rei's behaviour, and the bond she seems to have with Gendo, in contrast to Shinji's own and much more strained relationship with his father. Through his persistent efforts to befriend Rei however, she ends up opening up somewhat to him and realizing more about herself and her role in the Human Instrumentality Project.
    The extent of Shinji's attraction to Rei is unclear even to him; certainly, it is of a different sort than his sexual and seemingly romantic attraction to
    Asuka
    . It is implied that he is drawn to the vestiges of his mother that lie within Rei. As they grow closer, their relationship is a source of both joy and pain for both of them. It should be noted though, due to being genetically related to Rei's ultimate fate, the two may never have a romantic relationship, or even wish for one. Rei also seems to associate Shinji with Gendo with some level, implying she might also feel a form of familial connection with him. Shinji relates to Rei's sense of isolation and loneliness; it is not until Shinji is absent that Rei begins to understand that she was in fact feeling these things. She comes to realize that she wants to protect him, and in the battle with
    Armisael
    , she self-destructs to save Shinji. After Rei comes back as another clone, Shinji becomes alienated from her, however, in End of Evangelion she decides to hand control of Instrumentality to Shinji instead of Gendo, and gives him the choice to accept or reject it. She is last seen in
    briefly watching Shinji just before he notices Asuka on the beach.
    Anno has described Rei as Shinji's unconscious self.
    <p key="19140cd4-a6d2-47f0-aca7-b2b9bef34fe6">
     Rei has a much stronger bond to Shinji in the manga and their relationship has far more development, as Rei is greatly impacted by touching Shinji's hands and as Armisael attacks her, she realizes she has feelings for him she cannot understand. She also realizes she is jealous of Asuka dividing Shinji's attention. However, she is absent from the ending.  While Asuka was as a symbol of "heterosexual desire", Sadamoto designed Rei as a "mother figure",
     thinking of her as "the Yin opposed to Asuka".
     As such, he decided to give Rei more room in the manga, emphasizing Rei's maternal role.

    Shinji looks up to
    Kaji
    as a sort of mentor, and accepts behavior in him that he would disapprove of in other characters. For instance, in
    Episode 08
    when Kaji asks him about Misato's sleeping habits, implying that Shinji and Misato might be in a sexual relationship and simultaneously implying that he is intimately familiar with these habits as well, Shinji just laughs rather than being overwhelmed with embarrassment. After the
    Israfel
    fiasco, it was Kaji who came up with the idea of the dance routine to help Shinji and Asuka synchronize with each other. His relationship with Misato is constantly paralleled with Shinji's own relationship with Asuka,
    A common interpretation
    is to see Kaji as Shinji's positive adult role model, with
    Gendo
    as a more negative model.
    Similarly,
    Misato
    and

     Ritsuko
    </a>
    are mirrors for
    Asuka
    , as are their respective relationships.
    Kaji gives advice to Shinji multiple times on many matters though Shinji has difficulty understanding him, as Kaji has his own insecurities. He motivates Shinji to pilot again in Episode 19.
    <p key="327b74c7-4565-40a4-a0c8-34a805da643c">
     In the manga, Kaji's mentorship of Shinji is more developed, and after the accident with Toji and Unit 03, Kaji makes Shinji realize the true power of his actions (and inactions), as Kaji is considerably more critical of Shinji in the manga. After the battle with Bardiel, Shinji says Touji's death was Gendo's fault alone, but Kaji replies that Shinji had a chance to save him but decided to just sit back. He tells Shinji he is no different from him, and needs to stop pretending nothing has happened. Shinji asks him what he can do, and Kaji tells him he must fight and not look away from the truth. This helps him to accept his role as Unit 01's pilot. Shinji is the first (after Misato) to realize that Kaji had been killed.

     Though fans have speculated on the exact nature of Shinji's relationship with Kaworu, it is clear that Kaworu represents a sort of idealized figure to Shinji,
     as he appears out of seemingly nowhere when Shinji is completely desperate for any sort of connection with anyone, as all of his friends are either dead, unreachable or alienated from him. Kaworu had premeditated encountering Shinji in the lake.
     He immediately shows great interest in Shinji, making him initially uncomfortable.
     However, Kaworu telling him he liked him surprised Shinji as he is afraid of talking to

      Rei
     </a>
     , as Shinji has internalized his belief that nobody cared about him thanks to his own partly self-imposed isolation - afterwards, feeling that Kaworu has simply used him further reinforces this, as he thinks everyone is lying to him, because Shinji is unwilling to recognize the ambiguity and insecurity in other people, and the risk and uncertainty involved in reaching out to them himself, something Kaworu temporarily allowed him to ignore. Kaworu uses the ambiguous "suki" form
     and can simply mean "like" or "fond of", and that he is deserving of "koui" (好意), which means simply "good will" or "favor", not "koi", "love".
     Similarly, public baths are casual, even public social occurances in Japan, specially in the countryside that Anno is from.
     When he mentions this to
     Misato
     later, Shinji also used the ambiguous "suki" form. This line has necessary ambiguity in order to represent Kaworu's own lack of understanding regarding levels of intimacy and societal norms, part of what shocks Shinji and allows Kaworu to bypass his barriers of self-defense, as he isn't even aware those exist, as he himself has none. When Shinji is fighting Kaworu, he states Kaworu has betrayed him, just like

     , when Shinji is traumatized by experiencing Misato's death and seeing
     Asuka's

     </a>
     are present bring into question how much Kaworu affected him besides Shinji's own desperation. Shinji, in fact, seeking unconditional affection from everybody, unwilling to return their own needs, is a fact that has hindered Shinji's happiness throughout most of the series, and Kaworu, being a somewhat non-human character without his own emotional needs (whereas

     This, paired with the fact that Shinji had killed what he saw as a human being and someone he cared about, was part of what drove him into his state of absolute despair in
     Episode 25

     . Shinji depositing all of his hopes for self-worth onto Kaworu, and having that fail him, also reinforces Shinji's notions that if he can't rely unconditionally on people and never risk rejection then he is not actually loved by anyone at all and everyone should just die, part of what motivates him to start Third Impact. In

     , Shinji desperately seeks this same sort of unconditional affection from Asuka, and is still certain that he is unloved and unworthy, as he demonstrates he has, in fact, returned to his own childish beliefs about himself, even after the way Kaworu (whom he does not even mention) treated him, and other characters respond to him that he is, in fact, liked and treated nicely by them, but Shinji refuses to believe it. In contrast to Kaworu, when Shinji, in a similar state of desperation, asks for Asuka's own unconditional affection, Asuka refuses as she does not want to be an emotional crutch and an escape for him, and demands he gives himself to her as well, but Shinji is unwilling to give back any affection himself. Asuka says he doesn't really like anyone, as he doesn't even love himself. When Kaworu and Rei as Adam and Lilith state they collectively represent the hope for understanding and love, Shinji replies it is just a pretense, but if he returns to the real world, at least there he will know his feelings are real.

     In volume 10 of the manga Shinji is repulsed when Kaworu does CPR on him while he is hyperventilating, and insistently questions Shinji on human feelings, which he rebuffs and then angrily storms off. Shinji in the manga constantly avoids Kaworu as when he met him Kaworu killed a stray cat, which upsets Shinji. He recalls this just before Shinji kills him and says Shinji can no longer be indifferent to him if he decides to kill him, and Shinji imagines himself strangling him personally when they met. Shinji admits to Misato that he was indeed drawn to him and his mysterious nature, because he thought he did need new friends after killing

     , but asks Misato why people are drawn to others, and Misato tells him it is because man was made incomplete and needs to seek out others in order not to feel alone. Sadamoto has stated that their relationship in the manga is like that of a younger primary school student seeking admiration from an older, middle school one, not romance.
     Sadamoto has also explained he wished to make the relationship less ambiguous in the manga. Sadamoto says Kaworu feels for Shinji a reflection of Rei's feelings, however Shinji rejects him as he is not Rei. The choking scene in the manga is inspired from a film called Betty Blue, by Jean-Jacques Beineix. This is contrast to the scene in
     End of Evangelion
     , which according to Megumi Ogata was based on an experience of a female acquaintance of Anno's. He says it does not have the same meaning as the film's. He also says he does not understand the success of his character.
     Sadamoto has also has expressed the view that Kaworu was interested in how humanity evolves and their relationships.
     Shinji's voice actress Megumi Ogata also agrees with the translation for the Netflix/Khara release, saying she originally interpreted Kaworu's lines as "like", and says she's glad that the new version is closer to the Japanese original
     , as she interprets her relationship as friends.
     Like other characters, Anno described Kaworu as being based on himself, though he likened him to Rei as part of his Jungian shadow, in contrast to Shinji, Asuka and Misato as his conscious parts.
     This comparison was also made with Gendo.
     Hideaki Anno has also denied "carnal feelings" on Shinji's part.

     's relationship with Shinji is different from the ones she shares with the other pilots. She acts in a more motherly, kindly, less intense sort of way than Misato does, perhaps because she is aware of the sufferings a pilot undergoes and of Gendo's own indifference toward his son. Shinji's cynical attitude mirrors her own detached stoicism; in a scene from the manga, when Misato notes Shinji's rather glum mood, Ritsuko responds, "A cheerful, confident Shinji would be all the more disconcerting." Initially, in the series, Ritsuko is on friendly terms with Shinji and colludes with him in chiding Misato on her disastrous approach to instant food, preferring to be invited over for dinner "when Shinji's cooking". In the anime, it is Ritsuko, not Misato, who asks Shinji to take Rei's ID card to her apartment. Shinji's closeness with Rei disturbs Ritsuko; in the manga, it is implied that her jealousy toward Rei also stems from Rei's friendliness with Shinji, since he is Gendo's son. (Moments before attempting to strangle Rei, Ritsuko notes how the girl has "both the Commander and his son wrapped around her little finger.") Ritsuko notes Shinji's complacency and trusts him to do as he's told, making him an ideal pilot in her view. Nonetheless, she seems to resent having to use child soldiers, though she believes this is acceptable as a necessary part of a greater goal. In episode 23, in retaliation for SEELE's interrogation and Gendo's indifference, she takes Shinji (with Misato in tow) to

     , this disturbs Shinji greatly, motivating him to retaliate at Nerv and Gendo, and later to temporarily quit piloting. Though it is unclear as to whether or not he knew of Hikari's feelings for Toji, he preemptively discounted her from his friends after the incident with Unit 03.

    manga is considerably different from his animated counterpart. Although Shinji still has issues with his father and his past, and is plagued by self-doubt and feelings of worthlessness, he is considerably more apathetic, depressive, and he is also prone to being angry, snide and sarcastic rather than being fearful and cringing. Shinji in the manga is also much more violent than he is in the anime. For example, one of the first things he does after being forced to attack Toji (who is severely injured and crippled in the anime, but actually dies of his injuries in the manga) is to try to punch his father. He is also something of a know-it-all and slightly more audacious and cynical when it comes to dealing with others, for instance mentally thinking of Asuka as a "bitch" and displaying a dislike for her, though they get closer over time. Fan opinion of this characterization is mixed, with some preferring the manga Shinji because he has more of a "backbone", more like a typical hero. However, other fans feel that removing Shinji's neurotic anti-hero aspects makes him less human and harder to relate to.
    <p key="2c0076ad-9557-4d6c-a0d1-73067d6100f7">
     Throughout the majority of the manga, Shinji appears to be attracted to Rei Ayanami, and their relationship is far more developed than in the anime. After the battle against Ramiel, Shinji offers support to an injured Rei to walk to the rescue team, in a similar way it is implied at the end of
     Evangelion 1.0
     . He openly encourages Rei to fight for her life for she would be glad to have survived eventually. One day she invited him into her home to drink tea, even though she never made tea before. She gets burned in the process, leading Shinji to aid her against the burn and to prepare the tea for both of them. She also encourages him to speak to his father. At one point, she says a monologue about her feelings towards touching his hand in multiple occasions, ending with her asking to hold his hand again. He is also more visibly upset over her death after Unit-00's explosion. They share a final conversation before Shinji leaves to the new world, in which Rei thanks him for teaching her many things, which ends with her smiling at him and asking if it was the right expression.

     . He confesses his love to her in a way, claiming, "The Asuka I want to protect isn't this empty shell!" However, instead of shaking her and revealing her body, Asuka wakes up and chokes Shinji until she is subdued by the nurses. This suggests that Shinji's manga adaptation has feelings for Asuka as well.

     Shinji's reason for refusing to pilot Unit-01 is also different in the manga. Unlike in

He is then convinced by Misato that he will pilot to become stronger, to no longer be afraid and rely on others, and he reluctantly agrees, since he knows Misato is dying. Shinji's relationship with Misato is a little more fleshed out; he shows a great level of sadness when Misato pushes him into the elevator after kissing him as unlike in

     ). It is unclear how much of the pre-Instrumentality world carries over into this one, although the déjà-vu Shinji experiences on seeing Asuka and Kensuke, as well as "relics" resembling Angels, suggests that some significant portion of it has. Shinji is different in this world: although he is still plagued by self-doubt, he is much more confident and open, and is ready to meet change head-on. In the very last panel, as Shinji leaves the train station in Tokyo, Misato's cross pendant is seen tied to his suitcase. He thus fulfills the promise he made to her in her final moments, though it is unknown how much of Misato's memory carries over into this reality.

Three years after thwarting the ritual, Shinji has grown up to be more assertive and self-confident, to the point of even becoming the new class representative. While he still doesn’t find any particular joy in piloting the Evangelion, he doesn’t seem to hate it anymore and he is willing to do it in order to save those he cares about. Likewise, Shinji has gotten over most of the issues regarding his father, although he still thinks about him from time to time and wishes he could talk with him. In fact, the very last thing Shinji does in ANIMA is expressing his desire to go meet his father, who had returned to the real world during the events of Volume 5.

     Early in the story, Shinji is killed during the fight with the rogue Rei Quatre; but survives when the core of Unit-01 (now called Super Eva) becomes a dimensional heart for both of them. This grants him a special connection with his Evangelion, to the point that it responds to his emotions even when he’s not in the entry plug. However, Shinji’s new heartbeat is seen as an aberration by Armaros, who sends the Angel Carriers and the Torwätchers to either steal the heart or outright destroy it.

     Shinji is still good friends with Toji despite the Eva-03 incident, and although his interactions with Misato aren’t as frequent, it’s pretty clear that they’re both in good terms. His relationship with the Reis is a bit more complicated, especially with Rei Trois, because Shinji fears he’s subconsciously seeing her as a replacement for his mother. Fortunately, he grows out of this mindset in the course of Volume 3. He doesn’t hold a grudge against Rei Quatre for killing him, but although she kisses him a couple of times, he either reacts with shock and confusion, or doesn’t react at all. By contrast, he almost has no problems with Rei Six, mostly due to her innocence and child-like nature.

     As for Asuka, it’s shown thorough the story that Shinji cares a great deal about her. When she is on the moon, he tries to contact her almost every day from Earth, and when Shinji believes that she has died, he and Super Eva burst into flames due to pure rage. After Asuka fuses with Unit-02 and becomes Crimson A1, Shinji is one of the few people whom she listens to, and when his heart is stolen by a Torwätcher, Shinji mentions that he can sense Crimson A1 touching it, and that her warmth soothes him. Their relationship becomes a key element for the plot of Volume 5, both at the start and at the end. It opens with Asuka, back to normal, hugging Shinji in the entry plug of Super Eva and rescuing him from a berserk-like state. Then, during the climax of the final battle, Asuka, temporarily refused into the Crimson A1, summons a new Eva and a new body for Shinji, who had previously died. Asuka does this after Kaji tells her to “Think of the one you love. You must give him a vessel.”

    Shinji's personality in video games is usually reminiscent of his anime self, but his choices depend on the player choices. Most games, such as
    Girlfriend of Steel 2
    , allow him to pursue relationships with Asuka and, less commonly, Rei and Kaworu, and many other characters including Misato and Hikari, or original characters such as
    Mana
    and
    Mayumi
    . Some games have no romantic options or only one (

     also directed. He also initially designed the protagonist as an "Asuka-type girl" but this was eventually changed in favor of a boy, as Sadamoto suggested it'd fit a "robot story" better. Similarly, the relationship between Asuka and Shinji would be similar to the relationship between Jean, Nadia's love interest and eventual husband in the earlier Nadia.

     Sadamoto drew Shinji in an ordinary summer school uniform with a white shirt, making him "an average character", alongside Gendo as his first two designs. He wanted a "realistic and ordinary" boy, a character "that'll be hard for others to make".
     Since Shinji lacks the enthusiasm and courage of other robot-anime heroes, Sadamoto gave him a different heroic interpretation: "rather than a reflection of a hero, sort of a refraction of a hero". At first, he tried to create a character "that would tap into the consciousness of today's anime fans". Shinji was first drawn with slightly different features, which were changed by the main staff. In one of Sadamoto's original proposals, he had long hair which would have covered his face or fluttered in the wind. Sadamoto changed his mind, finding his original design "too wild".

     Evangelion animator Shinji Higuchi. For the last name, he chose the Japanese word Ikari ("anchor"), linking it, alongisde the names of other characters in the series, to nautical jargon or Japanese Imperial Navy warships, particularly Gendo and Kaji.

     Shinji's character was conceived to reflect Anno's personality "both in conscious and unconscious part".
     Like all characters, Anno based Shinji on himself, and like Asuka and Misato, Anno considered Shinji as part of his conscious self.
     He was thus represented as "a melancholic oral-dependent type" caught "in [an] oral stage", like Anno considered himself.
     Seeing Shinji as a reflection of Anno, assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki avoided depicting him as a brave character, since "Anno isn't that much of a hero".
     "Shinji was summoned by his father to ride a robot, Anno was summoned by Gainax to direct an animation", he said.
     Like other male protagonists in Gainax series, Shinji was conceived with a weak and insecure personality. Gainax wanted to reflect the psychological state of animation fans and the Japanese society, in which fathers are always at work and emotionally absent.
     Anno set the protagonist at "age fourteen", when "independence of mind starts manifesting".
     Initially, Shinji. was more mature, robust and less introverted than the final version; he should also have been portrayed as a studious boy, a "quiet A-student".
     His scholastic conduct would not be seen in a positive light, but as a sign of passivity.
     As an overall goal, Shinji's age meant he was at a formative point in life.

    <p key="1b2acdf2-8b9c-493d-8e38-882c1d7872a5">
     For the Evangelion manga, Sadamoto wondered "what the world looked like through Shinji's eyes", changing the main theme from "running or not running away" to "being honest with themselves".
     This led Sadamoto to change Shinji's characterization and psychology. He wanted to reflect contemporary teenagers in the character and as more of a "bad boy",
     and was influenced by the Gulf War, wondering how a 14-year-old would have behaved on a helicopter.
     Sadamoto also drew on his own experiences as an adolescent, saying that his characterization was "more like a flunk-out" than Anno's version.
     He conceived Shinji with a "clean image that a woman tends to project" in his mind, portraying him as a "cold, unambitious" character, "the type who would commit suicide, but can't bring himself to do it". "It was my intention to create a wistful character who had given up on life", he said. Sadamoto has mentioned he identified with Kensuke the most out of all characters, as Shinji himself is instead modelled on Anno, and for that he preferred to have an alternate intepretation of Shinji, but not one based on himself. Instead, Sadamoto identified with Kensuke.

     In contrast to his comments in the 1990s regarding NGE, in 2009, afer the release of Evangelion 2.0, Anno had instead said he identified with the younger adults.
     and when making 3.0+1.0, he now identifies with Gendo rather than Shinji. For this reason, he felt incapable of developing Shinji's story, and asked for the input of his voice actress.
