Asuka decided to use her progressive knife to cut their way through when a message from Hakone came, telling her that they were noticed and the Spear of Longinus was coming at their direction. The hole that Asuka did was eventually closed and their Evangelions slid across the barrier with the movement of the Spear. To alter their trajectory, Cinq decided to boost her S² engine to emergency output levels using the force of it to push the tip of knife even further into the barrier. But due to the External S² Engines being extracted from the
   Mass Production Evangelion
   , Unit-0.0 couldn't control and the output was increasing without stopping. Before a decision could be made, a head of a Mass Production Evangelion with her Cinq's entry plug in its mouth appeared from her own Evangelion, sprouting from the S² Engine spine, not being able to eject her own plug. The MP Evangelion grew arms and attempted to break 0.0 neck as Cinq cried out in pain. She tells Asuka that she thinks that she is the part of Ayanami that she shows to the world. Like someone took the face she wears for other people and made that into a person, or at least that part of her is emphasized in Cinq. Asuka answers that maybe that is how she started, but if she didn't like it, she could change it, offering her help to figure it out together. Cinq thanks her and uses her Evangelion's laser barrel to project a powerful A.T. Field blasting a hole in the Curtain, forcing Unit-02 Type II Allegorica into the hole. When Asuka turns, she saw the two Evangelions exploding into a massive cross of light.
