   . It is generally considered a cornerstone of supplemental canon for the influx of new information it provides and given a great deal of weight due to the participation of Gainax staff in providing information for worldbuilding. Taking discrepancies in security access into account (e.g., it requires a higher clearance level to learn that the white giant is Lilith rather than Adam), the information appears to reconcile almost completely with the show.

    Keep in mind that this is all written in-universe

   , and some of it is deliberately misleading, at least in the lower clearance levels.

   The CI could be considered to fall somewhere between
   tier 2
   or
   tier 3 canon (on EvaWiki)
   , due to the fact that there is no way of confirming that the information is "100% Anno" and wasn't embellished at all by the game's producers. According to the Japenese fan-wiki, Alpha Systems (makers of the game) say the information was supervised by Gainax staff, but Gainax has also repeatedly stated that "Enough information has been provided in the TV series and film.
   These are just the settings established for the game." Also, Newtype USA only mentions Anno being consulted for the game and this seems to have been reflected in the knowledge presented in the CI, not the multiple alternative scenarios present in the game, which are mostly used for comedic purposes.
   . Additionally, Anno himself has stated they will not provide an "all-about Eva manual".
   With that said, unlike the specific alternative scenarios present in the game, almost all information here does not clash with the series at all, and in the few cases where it does, the series should take priority. Please refer to

the Angels. One example is the A.T. Field, which can manipulate a physical

   An Eva is a vessel for a soul that has abandoned human form, and a 
magnification of the ego, i.e., the embodiment of a large human being. 
Attempts were made to operate Evas, but souls were not placed within them, and 
the insertion of a soul was essential. The soul that enters an Eva is called a 
pilot. However, it takes more than a pilot to make Eva move. Perhaps the pilot 
cannot properly utilize the Eva's capabilities.

   A unit called a core is used to eliminate any discrepancies in the joining of Eva, the body of a god, with that of a human being's soul. The soul of the pilot's mother, which is placed within the core, acts as a medium and makes piloting possible.
  </p>
  <p key="9cd32440-73b6-4026-b27f-4ff96949d51c">
   Due to difficulties encountered in the development of Eva-00, the core's system 
is poorly constructed, and the Eva falls behind in performance capacity as a result. 
Another reason for this is that Eva-00's pilot, Rei, does not have a 
mother.

   The discovery of Adam created a firm conviction and propelled Seele forward. 
Several projects were simultaneously enacted around the time of Second Impact 
(both before and after): The excavation of the Black Moon (i.e., Hakone) and 
the discovery of Lilith; the founding of the Artificial Evolution Laboratory 
and the subsequent formulation of Gehirn; the dissemination of the Human 
Limitation Theory; the establishment of the Human Instrumentality Committee; 
and the development of a world led by the United Nations, who would keep vigil 
over the battles with the Angels.

then, Nerv itself was created.

   For the purpose of opening the Path to God, Gendo and Seele brought 
Lilith's growth to a point just before the final stage, and to temporarily 
delay this they are having Nerv transport the Spear of Longinus that was paired 
with Adam.

   A copy of a personality is made in the dummy plug, but a soul cannot be copied. 
Why can't it be done, or how would it be done? As far as the technology branches 
of Seele and Nerv are concerned, it is a theme of research integral to seeking 
out the Path to God, and study into how to deal with the problem has spanned 
many years. Examples of failure include Yui and Asuka's mother. The dummy plug 
is something that came about in the midst of that research.

   The dummy systems are artificial souls that were developed at the end of the 
research. In terms of functionality, however, the dummy systems leave much to be desired: 
although they could make Evas activate, that was the limit of their capacity.

   The facilities for Nerv Headquarters were constructed in a mysterious, giant, 
underground space existing beneath Tokyo-3. It is a hemispherical cavity with a 
diameter of 6 km and a height of 0.9 km, but 89% of it is currently buried. 
Sunlight is sent in by optical fibers from a light-condensing block on the 
surface, maintaining a level of brightness comparable to that on the surface. 
Although Nerv facilities are nearly the only things being constructed, there 
are also evacuation shelters for civilians.

at the South Pole. Moreover, the First Angel, designated "Adam", was discovered 
within it.

   Initially, the White Moon — containing Adam — fell to Earth. The Black Moon, 
which originally should have gone to a different solar system, was captured by 
Earth's gravity, and, after it crashed into the Earth's surface and bounced, it 
became a satellite orbiting the planet. It left behind only its ruins and 
remained in the heavens, and Lilith, the Seed that the Black Moon had carried, 
was implanted into Earth. Lilith's landing site is believed to have been in the 
vicinity of what is now called the South Pole, but it was later moved by 
tectonic plates, ultimately as far as the Hakone region of Japan. That site is 
the giant cavern of Hakone, and the future Nerv Headquarters would be 
constructed here.
