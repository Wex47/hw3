   The First Ancestral Race were inhabitants of an unknown world within the Milky Way Galaxy billions of years ago. It is possible that they were the first intelligent life in the Milky Way. At some point, their world faced imminent destruction, and their species confronted extinction.

  <p key="ac19edfc-39b0-44e9-baf6-9976d1fd95d3">
   However, in the face of termination, the members of the First Ancestral Race took measures to ensure the preservation of their legacy. They sent seven progenitor life forms, called
   Seeds of Life
   , to spread life descended from themselves in specified planets across the galaxy. Each Seed was imbued with the
   soul
   of a member of the First Ancestral Race, and placed aboard a carrier vessel known as a "
   moon
   ." Each Seed was accompanied by a
   Lance of Longinus
   , which can control and incapacitate a seed in case of any exigencies. This included enforcement of a rule implemented by the First Ancestral Race that only one Seed of Life could populate a given planet.

   The surviving members of the First Ancestral Race were united into seven singular life forms, each of which boarded a "moon" carrier. Presumably the members of the First Ancestral Race were reduced to their souls, and collected within the
   Chambers of Guf
   aboard each "moon" carrier. These souls would await rebirth on another world, meaning that both

   The First Ancestral Race are also the authors of the what are known as "
   Dead Sea Scrolls
   ." A copy of the Scrolls was placed in each "moon" carrier transporting a Seed of Life. The Scrolls are, essentially, a manual detailing the functionality of the Seeds of Life and the Spears of Longinus. They also contained prophecies about future events that would occur in the event that a Seed of Life is awakened.

While the Firstborn did not outright create life, they were the first race in the galaxy to achieve sentience, and in their travels across space set up experiments to try to encourage the development of sentience on planets where they encountered life (e.g. with proto-human apes on prehistoric Earth).
