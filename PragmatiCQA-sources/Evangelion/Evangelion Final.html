    Maya and the others successfully activate the pillar, which was actually a giant version of the sealing pillars seen in the two previous films. A radius of effect is created that pushes back the core-conversion, restoring part of the city. A large collection of Euro NERV storage lockers emerges from underground, filled with Evangelion spare parts, munitions, and components of JA-02. Two more teams come down in warships, and we're told that Unit-02 will be repaired and Unit-08 will be modified for "Overlap" compatibility. Mari promises to come back for Shinji

Asuka starts using a scarf around her neck to avoid triggering Shinji again. She keeps playing with her game console during those times, but leaves it behind when she goes to watch him. Toji and Hikari realize that Rei Ayanami (tentative name) is not the

Rei begins to learn more about her world, expressing confusion over the existence of a pregnant cat, baby Tsubame, and greetings such as "good morning" and "good night". She eventually settles down into village life by going to school and learning to farm alongside the older ladies of the village. The village is being supported by an organization named Kredit, which works together with Wille to provide supplies.

    AAA Wunder arrives to unload non-essential personnel. Kensuke and Toji ask Shinji to stay in the village, but Shinji decides to go aboard the Wunder with Asuka. Asuka allows it, but not before tasing him due to WILLE rules.  When Shinji wakes up on board,

    , however, she cries, somewhat relieved he's ok. Shinji is placed in isolation and under surveillance again, and both Asuka and Sakura express puzzlement at his return after discovering Kaworu's demise from the DSS Choker operational records. The bridge crew discusses the ongoing situation. Mari greets Asuka, who expresses the sentiment that Shinji "needs a mother, not a girlfriend". Ritsuko and Misato discuss their intentions in a space aboard Wunder dedicated to preserving seeds of life for all species, which is mentioned to be the original purpose of the vessel. Ritsuko implies that although Misato has a stoic face, in truth she is happy to see Shinji again, and that hiding those feelings, will only cause heartbreak. Elsewhere, Fuyutsuki monologues about the Black Moon and Fourth Impact as well as Shinji and the fate of "Ayanami-Type 6", wondering if Gendo deliberately made Shinji experience the same loss as him.

    Gendo and Fuyutsuki steer the Black Moon towards the epicenter of Second Impact, at NERV's former Calvary Base in Antarctica, intending to restart Evangelion 13. Misato and Ritsuko discover this and have completed a "signal suspension plug" to stop this event. Misato and the bridge crew reminisce about Kaji's death and their determination to fight NERV and restore the world to its original state. Mari and Asuka get their new plugsuits, and Mari reintroduces herself to Shinji. Asuka and Shinji talk and Shinji reveals that he understands Asuka's anger at his inaction in the previous movie. Asuka expresses her feelings for Shinji. She says she liked him at the time, but "grew up first"
    Mari and Asuka, satisfied, get into their Evangelions. A vision of Kaworu appears to Shinji saying that they will meet again, and Shinji agrees. AAA Wunder launches and heads towards Antarctica with the objective being the neutralization of Evangelion 13, in what Misato calls "

    Near Antarctica, Wunder is attacked by three NERV ships of the

    . During the battle, the Wunder resorts to using the guided-missile destroyers in its support fleet as giant guided missiles. Asuka and Mari sortie and battle their way through the swarm of NERV Evangelions. Asuka attacks Evangelion 13 with an anti-core weapon, but Evangelion 13 puts up an entirely unexpected A.T. Field. Wings of light appear from the remains of Calvary Base in a manner much like Second Impact, indicating an attempted Impact, not in SEELE's scenario. Asuka removes her eyepatch and removes a restraint within her eye that keeps the
    Ninth Angel
    under control, transforming into a new Ninth Angel and converting Unit-02 into a previously unseen radiant giant state. However, she plays into Gendo's plan in the process as Evangelion 13 awakens and destroys Unit-02 in much the same manner as Unit-01 destroyed Unit-03. During the process, Asuka is approached by "her original", revealing that she is a clone of the Shikinami series, and is absorbed by Evangelion 13. Wunder is taken over by a new
    Evangelion Mark.09-A
    , which Fuyutsuki is implied to have been responsible for.

    Gendo is revealed to be in the uppermost NERV vessel restraining the Wunder, and Misato and Ritsuko confront him. Ritsuko shoots Gendo, however, her bullets are entirely ineffective. It is revealed that Gendo has used the
    Nebuchadnezzar's Key
    and has thrown away his humanity by adding "information that surpassed the logic of the world" to his body. Gendo monologues about the purpose of the impacts and about the Human Instrumentality Project and begins the process of entering Evangelion 13. Shinji turns to Misato and asks to enter Unit-01 to stop Gendo. Midori and Sakura are appalled at the prospect of Shinji entering the Evangelion again and shoots at him, but Misato blocks Sakura's bullet with her own body. Misato apologizes to Shinji, and thanks him for saving them all from destruction using Unit-01 fourteen years previously, and explains that as his superior, the responsibility for his actions was ultimately hers, and since Shinji is still her subordinate, she will take responsibility for his actions. Mari takes Unit-08 into an "overlapping" state where it merges with
    Evangelion Mark.09-A
    ,
    Evangelion Mark.10
    ,
    Evangelion Mark.11
    , and
    Evangelion Mark.12
    . Shinji summons Unit-01. The original Rei Ayanami appears to him inside, with her hair grown long. She apologizes to him for not being able to make it so that he wouldn't have to get into an Evangelion, but Shinji thanks her and says he will take care of the rest. Ritsuko and Maya are shocked to discover that Shinji has attained an impossible infinite synchro-rate with Unit-01.

    Gendo and Shinji fight in a "minus space" where LCL gives shape to perception, entering a surreal fight where they clash in multiple different locations across space, time, and other Evangelion continuities. Gendo shows Shinji an "imaginary Evangelion", a Black Lilith predicted by the theories of Dr. Katsuragi. Misato prepares to turn the AAA Wunder into another Spear to hurl at a giant Red Rei. Mari uses her Evangelion combination to fight a new horde of NERV Evangelions. Misato sacrifices herself to hold back Gendo's "Additional Impact". Shinji meets Gendo and sees a vision of Gendo's past experiences and life, and how Yui's loss traumatized him. Shinji helps Gendo find closure, and similarly for Asuka, returning her feelings.
    At this point, it becomes increasingly surreal. Shinji talks to Kaworu and gives Kaworu the closure he seeks;
    Kaworu and the elder Kaji speak to each other and Kaworu, whom the elder Kaji calls "Commander Nagisa",
    agrees to go to the settlement where the younger Kaji farms. Shinji eventually settles upon a complete reset of the world, a "Neon Genesis", a world without Evangelions. Shinji returns all Evangelions and Failures of Infinity back into human and animal forms, restoring the world and turning it into a world without Evas.

    In the final sequence, Asuka, Rei and Kaworu are seen on the platform of a train station, and an older Shinji is approached by Mari from behind. Mari is surprised by Shinji's confidence when he takes out her glasses,
    and an adult Shinji (voiced by Ryunosuke Kamiki) and Mari head out into the world, and as Shinji lets go of Mari's hand, the sequence transitions into a live-action sequence of Anno's hometown, implying that all the Children have found closure in our reality.

   was expected for release in 2015. In 2014, director and producer Hideaki Anno announced that due to other commitments, the film would be further delayed to an unknown date. Following the troubled production of the third film, director and producer Hideaki Anno became depressed and stated publicly in 2015 that he could not work on another film. As part of his recovery, Anno had also worked on Studio Ghibli's

   . Financial reasons also played a part. In 2014, Anno's Studio Khara loaned his former company Studio Gainax 100 million yen ($916,400). In 2016, Anno filed a claim for debt collection, fearing not only for the return of the money but also because of Gainax selling production materials to third parties, after a precedent of other sales of intellectual property without informing him. This was part of several legal issues surrounding Gainax and Evangelion.

In May 2018, the studio put out a job listing for animation staff to work on 3DCG, VFX, and 2D animation starting on June 30, 2018. Animation was going through the final check by October 2, 2020. Dialogue recording wrapped on November 19, 2020. On December 16, 2020, Studio Khara announced that compositing and editing work had finished. In 2019 the film was scheduled for a June 27, 2020 release date but received two delays due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, first scheduled for a January 23, 2021 release, before being released on March 8, 2021.

   Anno felt that at that point the only people who could understand Shinji's feelings were Ogata herself and his personal assistant, Ikki Todoroki. Anno himself had intended to go to Paris for Japan Expo 2019, but the film's continuing delays in production prevented him. Anno had often visited the film's music composer Shirō Sagisu, who lives half the year in Paris, and wished to pay homage to the city in the opening 10 minutes of the movie, entitled

   , started recording in March 2019. As there were several changes to the plot, many voice actors had to come back and record lines again. In 2020, due to the pandemic restrictions, production slowed down further and recording was mostly done by the voice actors separately as many dozens of takes were necessary, and they organized themselves through a Line group. This created a bond between the cast that was unprecedented in previous productions. At the end of recording, Anno thanked the cast for their contributions. Yūko Miyamura, who played Asuka, was instructed to treat her character as completely separate from the series' Asuka Langley Soryu, and the last thing asked of her was to write the character's full name in cursive herself to be used in the movie. She had lived in Australia for the past two decades, but was still unsure of how to write "

Anno had long stated his wish to revitalize the anime industry, and saw the sponsorship of new creators as a prime way of achieving this, as well as the promotions of events backed by Studio Khara like the Japan Animator Expo. Director Mahiro Maeda recounted Anno wanted him to figure out specific details of the plot on his own when asked. Similarly to production in the series, Anno would take ideas from staffers but have the final word in plot decisions. Anno had also been an advocate of employing new and innovative animation technologies, combined with extensive use of motion capture and computer-generated imagery, and employed them in the film. Maeda and others noted nonetheless that Anno seemed to be directing the film more like a live action film than animation, including in the way he directed the voice actors, taking cues from theatre techniques, after his previous experience outside

   , despite the staff's own limited experience, something he had previously attempted in
   <i key="ccfeb033-45f0-4b17-b181-50018cc9b590">

   Director Kazuya Tsurumaki details Anno wanted to try a new process for the film. Instead of first creating storyboards and then developing the animation based on them as is traditional, Anno proposed to first draw the animation cels and then draw the scenes from them. This technique was generally referred to by staff as "pre-visualization". He was once more inspired from the usual process in live action, where scenes are first shot from multiple angles and then stories are created and then selected during editing. The latter half of the film, however, progressively returned to the traditional anime style. Tsurumaki noted the original intention was that "the first 80%" of the

   series would be a "compilation" of the original anime series, and the changes would only start with the last film, in keeping with earlier comments in 2006 by producer Toshimichi Ohtsuki regarding the intention that only the ending would be a major departure from the series, as staff felt

   movies were not going to be "metaphysical" like the original anime, but rather "oriented towards entertainment". This eventually changed, and major changes started happening as early as

   . He also noted that the previously stated goal of "destroying Evangelion" through the character of Mari was entrusted to an external party. Anno would ask the opinion of many parts of staff, including those not involved in the actual film like office staff for their opinions on several nuances. Anno's wife Moyoco Anno provided early designs for some characters. Studio Ghibli also provided assistance to scenes set in the survivor's village. For the village itself, Khara had a box model custom-built to orientate the artists, and Anno personally adjusted it to the smallest details like individual house layout, road with and utility posts to make it as realistic as possible. Staff consulted with multiple professionals and conducted research like sky-diving for maximum accuracy.

   A making-of documentary aired on Japanese broadcaster NHK in March 22, 2021, with the crew following production for 1214 days. BS Japan also broadcast an extended version of the documentary on April 29, 2021, totaling 100 minutes of runtime, featuring unused footage. Amazon Prime Video included the extended version of documentary in its international release of the film in August. When production started in 2016, Anno initially intended to not involve himself much in the film, wishing to delegate most of it to his directors, particularly Tsurumaki, generally considered Khara's second-in-command, but as the release date approached with mounting production problems he progressively took more control and took on more tasks directly, also driven by his perfectionism. Maeda was also not initially serving as a director, but was brought in the middle of production. Kim Morrisy of Anime News Network described it as tumultuous: "There were several occasions shown when he decided that the work he had done at the time was insufficient and would scrap it entirely. The [final] D part of the script was eventually completed in early 2019, at the latest possible stage it could have been done to meet the deadline."

   In the documentary, Anno is depicted as frequently late or absent from the studio, or would often stay overnight adjusting individual scenes he was unsatisfied with. Part A had been rewritten multiple times, and at one point Anno was so lost on how to resolve the story lines he considered restarting it from scratch after nine months of work. Anno believed he wouldn't miss working on the franchise and said everything he needed to, feeling finishing his work remained a priority, even at the expense of his well-being. Anno told Ogata later at post-production that he'd indeed miss it. Hayao Miyazaki described Anno, as an apprentice of his, as "one who sheds blood for his films". Gainax co-founder Toshio Okada criticized the documentary as "sloppy" and "propaganda" trying to make Anno look better, claiming Anno's live-action approach in fact took inspiration from Hiroyuki Yamaga's work in

   On March 28, 2021, the cast was fully reunited for the first time in 14 years and held a stage greeting, commenting on the film and their bond to the characters. On April 12, 2021, directors Anno, Tsurumaki and Maeda, as well as Ogata, held another stage greeting.  On June 26, 2021, Anno held a live stream on singer Hikaru Utada's Instagram page, and debated the film. On June 27, 2021, another cast greeting was held. Mari's voice actress Maaya Sakamoto explained she had been absent from the previous events because she felt apprehensive over the details she knew about Mari's character that Anno told her, but refused to share them: "I will take secrets to my grave". A last stage greeting was held on July 11, 2021. Anno felt he had now done everything he could with anime, and accordingly Khara denied reports that he was working on a reboot of a popular animation series. He also noted he initially attempted a shorter two hour runtime, but had to extend it.
