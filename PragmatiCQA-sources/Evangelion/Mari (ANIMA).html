Someone similar to Mari can be seen with Shinji's mother in the photo shown to him by Fuyutsuki, though the link between this person and Mari is currently unknown. It could suggest that Mari may be much older than she lets on, possibly suffering from the "Curse of Eva" for a longer period of time than Asuka. She also refers to

     Mari is named after two World War II warships, the Japanese destroyer
     (巻波, "overflowing waves") and the British aircraft carrier
     . The two names may be intended to, as in
     Asuka's
     case, represent a mixed heritage: here, British and Japanese (at minimum). Strictly speaking, neither "Illustrious" or "Makinami" (written as 真希波, "noble true wave") are real surnames,
     although this may be nothing more than a creative liberty. Originally, Anno considered naming her

     knowing little more of his intent for her than that he wanted her to "destroy Eva". Unlike the others, her character was not Anno's idea, but rather the result of an explicit request by the producer, Otsuki, for a new main female character. Anno accepted it as a way of differentiating the Rebuilds from the anime series, but believes it was for commercial reasons.
     Tsurumaki ended up taking inspiration from his previous work in
     and
     .
     Anno initially intended to make Mari a rather isolated charcater, devoid of relationships, but could not refrain from making her to much like the series' original characters, so decided to hand her development to others. Assistant director
     Kazuya Tsurumaki
     ended up shouldering much of the responsibility for Mari, and
     Yoji Enokido
     was also recruited during a writer's retreat to provide an outsider's opinion - Enokido is considered an outsider, and Mari's characterization ended up being mostly his and Tsurumaki's brainchild.
     This is in contrast to the existent NGE characters, which were all based on Anno himself to varying degrees.

    <p key="6e067a66-de2e-4f5c-b723-9bb272692bf1">
     Much of the disagreement revolved around how (and how

     framework, and the nature of her personality.
     In the very first drafts, Mari was to do little more than appear in the pre-title Third Angel sequence and to later observe the

     ), and Anno kept Asuka's role relatively intact relative to her NGE self, and she'd remain the focus of the film much like the corresponding Action Arc of the series.
     Various ideas were tested in early script drafts and storyboards wherein Mari took over part of another character's role from NGE, which was eventually abandoned due to the desire to give Mari her own identity. At first, Anno kept Asuka's role relatively intact relative to her NGE self Her personality changed from various different themes, like being a mysterious and quiet girl, or the
     archetype of a clumsy and careless girl, all in an attempt to differentiate her from Rei and Asuka.
     Anno decided to inpinge some relationships from other characters into hers in order to give her more spce, for instance, Kaji and Asuka's relationship was entirely removed from the film and replaced with Mari's "subordinate" role to Kaji.
     Other suggestions slowly began to surface as Anno could only give vague directions to his writers - one of his first was that the character should be an "Onee-san" or be an animal lover. The ideas were so generic and vague that Tsurumaki considered Mari to have had "multiple personalities"; "a different character in each scene she appeared in", making it difficult to give her a consistent characterization and psychology. Tsurumaki in particular felt she'd simply end up simply repeating Shinji's relationships with other characters and consuming their personalities. In the storyboard of the preparatory manuscript drawn by director Masayuki, there is a scenario introducing her to Shinji and others as the "Fourth Girl" at the 8th Apostle War Prewar Strategy Conference. In another storyboard, Mari would have pushed up her glasses in the same manner as Gendo.
     Anno decided to postpone discussion at the time. It was during this "script retreat" that Enokido was brought in as an outsider.
    </p>
    <p key="7811b1d9-f2e0-4858-b23b-6777c741f94c">

     , Anno progressively increased her role and space in the story. Tsurumaki noted she'd be a character of "minor importance" originally.
     Most of the new ideas ended up discarded and rejected by the rest of staff, who couldn't come to a consensus. In draft number 7, for instance, Mari would pilot Unit-02 together with Asuka in the same entry plug, in draft #11, Mari was depicted as an European classmate of Asuka's. Other ideas included playing up to stereotypes of her British nationality, like her first meeting Shinji in a train station, or having tea time on the roof of the school in draft #13. Tsurumaki felt particularly unsatisfied, and felt that Mari could never be distinct enough from Asuka, Rei or Misato. Tsurumaki eventually came up with the idea of her falling from the sky by way of parachute, as a way of having her do something bizarre and different.
    </p>
    <p key="f87605fb-0c88-494b-a530-e6cff8e47ec2">
     Enokido was asked for his input, and he suggested Mari to be a "neutral and lighthearted" character inspired by harem and shounen manga.
     Enokido's suggestion was that Mari should serve as a rival for Asuka who ultimately usurps her. Enokido wanted to go so far as to have Mari become the main pilot for Unit 02, say
     <i key="5621b4ca-3341-43f5-825b-ae7c642abf80">
      anta baka
     </i>
     to Shinji and even kiss him, though this was eventually discarded by Anno and other writers. Tsurumaki, in particular, protested one of the proposed alterations as “I’m an Asuka fan, and I won’t be happy if this scene gets cut”.
     Enokido also suggested for Mari to be full of tattoos symbolizing her dead pets.
     Anno's assistant,
     , suggested scenarios like her being a guest at
     Hikari's
     house, and a rival with Asuka for Kaji's affections and control of Unit 00, beating her in a synch test. One inspiration for her demeanour were the

     These indecisions led to about forty revisions of the script in total, and the writers were mostly forced to come to an agreement when repeatedly reaching deadlines.

     Similary to his other attempts to distance himself from Mari's conceptualization, Anno gave initially vague

     </i>
     to Sadamoto and Tsurumaki. In one of her old character designs, her plugsuit is numbered 04 instead of 05 like she appears initially in the movie. Anno requested her design be based on a "Christian Missionary-style". Other early designs included a Victorian version of Mari, playing on English stereotypes, and her checkered skirt was in reference to Scottish stereotypes. Her early association with green and use of tights was in reference to pictures of British schoolgirls Anno brought to Sadamoto when he asked for references. Initially, he also considered giving her a long-sleeved blazer.
     Sadamoto concluded that her glasses were a simple but effective way to differentiate her from the other main female characters.
     Mari was intended to attract a new kind of fan, and a character that could be "broken".
     Additionally, Anno thought Mari's glasses were a good way to showcase their animators' talent, as it was much harder to animate them in the original series. Harkening back to his experiences with FLCL, Tsurumaki had also attempted at the time to differentiate female character Haruko from Evangelion characters, particularly Misato, and avoid comparisons, further solidifying his leading role in conceptualizing Mari.
    </p>
    <p key="7b087872-3dbe-40d6-84e9-9c5d2aecfcc6">
     At first, Sadamoto simply merged Asuka's and Rei's characters; however, he himself was dissatisfied with the result, thinking the character was too derivative. To visually distinguish her from the two protagonists of the series, he gave her straight, dark hair and a taller head and body than her colleagues. The eyes instead were designed to be long and well defined, so as to give her a more kawaii look. He opted for a hairstyle with two braids, but since Asuka also has hair with two braids, Anno suggested moving the springs of the braids down, adding a band. For the posture and hairstyle, inspiration was taken in particular from those of actress Yui Aragaki, who played Umemura Hikari in the dorama
     . Anno decided to make the character wear two different combat suits, one old and one new generation, as a further element of detachment from the other pilots.
    </p>
    <p key="0a7bbe86-646b-4ce0-8613-7b78b50df9ff">
     In the very early stages of production, staff considered a plugsuit in green, indigo or yellow, and then moved to pink, a color popular in anime, giving her a touch of femininity. Sadamoto later noticed that, compared to the white and red models of Rei and Asuka, pink has less visual impact, which is why he then gave her a more "scandalous" color, so for her reveal in the green plugsuit, he opted for green, which he also associated with England, from
     .
     The proposal was made by the colorist Kikuchi Kazuko, and was immediately welcomed with fervor by Sadamoto. Its design was inspired by the green uniforms of the Gamilas from
     , as well as by some spacesuits from the TV series
     , and the space suits of Soviet cosmonauts. Sadamoto attempted to give her a sleekier, more modern design that'd feel updated, but still similar to the existing pilots' suits. Anno decided to give it a helmet as well, in order to cover the face until the end of the battle and create a dramatic effect for her reveal; for the design of the helmet Sadamoto took inspiration from those of
     , much like
     Misato's
     motorcyclist-inspired
     jacket. The design of the lower part of the suit, however, traced that of fencing suits, feeding the idea of a girl belonging to European aristocracy, and more mature than the other pilots.
     There are several nods to her age being in fact much older than the other pilots.
    </p>
    <p key="b4356e48-c7a7-40f6-9dd4-ebeb30bb949a">
     Sadamoto had considerable impact in her earlier characterization as well. Due to his experience in the

      Evangelion manga
     </a>
     , staff valued his input in how to handle the reduced space for characterization the movie format gave them. Producer Ohtsuki also complained to Anno that they had not yet decided on a voice actress even by the time the recording stage of production was imminent. Ohtsuki asked other staff for suggestions, and using Maaya Sakamoto, a famous voice actress that Sadamoto, Enokido and Tsurumaki worked with before on
     but had no familiarity with Eva was Sadamoto's idea. Maaya Sakamoto was called and selected without an audition or explanations, and would only then receive some information on the character.
     Sakamoto, after trying hard to interpret the character, concluded from explanations by Anno and Tsurumaki that she'd play the character as an "alien" element to Evangelion.
     Sakamoto says she herself still has difficulty understanding Mari's character an that she's full of mysteries, an opinion shared by Ogata, Shinji's voice actress.
     She says Anno shared several important details with her, but she says she won't reveal them: "I'll take it to my grave".
     Moyoco Anno has commented on associating herself with Mari,
