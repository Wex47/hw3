     Misato appears to have some sort of affinity for Shinji despite being over twice his age. She finds Shinji's presence to be a grounding and stabilizing influence. In the manga, when talking with Shinji at the train station after his first attempt to run away from NERV, Misato confesses to Shinji that she took him in not because she thought it was her duty to do so, but because she was lonely. It becomes apparent to Misato that many of Shinji's problems in dealing with people closely echo her own, although their coping mechanisms are opposites of each other, and that they seem to be caught in a "Hedgehog's dilemma," as Ritsuko calls it.

     ; however, the context of the scene gives this action multiple possible meanings. More prominently, she tries to be both a friend and a maternal influence for Shinji (which carries over to the other pilots), balancing this with her duties and responsibilities as his commanding officer at NERV. Near the end of the series, Misato and Shinji's shared and separate traumas put distance between them, and Shinji can neither let himself comfort her (

     Misato and Ritsuko are close friends at the start of the series, and flashbacks reveal that Ritsuko was one of Misato's first friends in college. However, their friendship dissolves as Misato learns more about the Instrumentality Project and Ritsuko's role in its development, as well as her complicity in its secrecy. They also clash frequently (and sometimes violently) over the lives of the Eva pilots during combat, as Ritsuko is willing to sacrifice the pilots if the situation appears to warrant it while Misato is dedicated to their survival. Later, she snidely comments on the fractured relations between Misato, Shinji, and Asuka, which Misato angrily retorts by accusing Ritsuko of substituting her cats for human affection.

Ritsuko, on the other hand, sees her mother's suicide as a selfish act, a petty attempt at self-redemption after what she did to Rei I and realizing that she had been cast aside. Misato's love for Kaji and ultimately Shinji leads her to want to protect the pilots' lives, whereas to Ritsuko, they are initially just a means to an end. The women end up emulating the parents they hated throughout their final year, with vastly differing results. The circle is completed in

     .
     Hideaki Anno described Misato as "a woman, twenty-nine, who lives life so lightly as to barely allow the possibility of human touch. She protects herself by keeping relationships on the surface, and by running away."
     Anno originally intended for the protagonist to be a girl, and Misato as a "older-sister" figure supporting her. Sadamoto developed this Misato was conceived as a "girl next door" in the military.
     The name

     ). However, various parents may choose to write it as "Optical village" or "Truth village". In addition, instead of the more common kanji for "village", a version meaning "home village" with the same pronunciation can be used, making the name

     ). To outline her personality, Anno was inspired by Usagi Tsukino, the 14-year-old protagonist of the Sailor Moon series, thinking of Misato as a more adult Usagi.
     Sadamoto consequently drew her taking inspiration from Usagi's character design, incorporating her hairstyle.
     The aesthetic similarities of the characters were emphasized by the choice of the voice actress, Kotono Mitsuishi, who played both roles. Some staff members, such as Jun'ichi Satō, had already worked for the animated version of Sailor Moon.
     For her physiognomy, staff was also inspired by Fujiko Mine from
     and by the Japanese writer Aya Sugimoto.
     Early on she was described as an older sister for Shinji, and initially would have been a 1st Lieutenant.

     Sadamoto decided to give her the appearance of a motorcyclist, inspired by the clothes worn by racers.
     As a motorsport enthusiast himself, Sadamoto depicted her as a fan of sports cars. It was his idea to give her a modified Renault Alpine A310, designed by mecha designer Ikuto Yamashita,
     as a tribute to the first episode of Lupin III, where there is a Renault Alpine A110.
     Misato has a bit of an affinity for European cars in the original series, and is a devotee of this particular marque, on her bedroom wall she has a poster of an A110 during a race. She has also been seen driving a red Ferrari 328 GTS when arriving at Tokyo-3's school. In

     </i>
     , however, she forgoes the Alpine for a white Mazda Cosmo Sport 110, with a red racing stripe.
     She carries a Heckler &amp; Koch USP as her personal sidearm, compared to the Glock 17 that the other NERV personnel are seen wielding. It is only seen a few times in the series, but she demonstrates great skill with it.

    <p key="6dae1b6c-7084-4817-a4c6-f443c822e3bf">
     As with other characters, Anno described Misato as a part of himself. Misato would be, alongside Asuka and Shinji, part of his conscious self. However, Anno felt difficulty in representing a female character, and liked to read romance novels written by women to better understand their feelings.
     Misato's handwritten note to Shinji in
     Episode:01
     was actually written by Anno himself.
     Similarly, Misato's apartment is actually a reproduction of Anno's own.
     Misato's implied sex scene with Kaji in
     Episode:20
     was said by Anno to actually be a massage scene to TV Tokyo in order to get permission to air it.
     Misato had no line in the script, so Anno left it up to her voice actress Kotono Mitsuishi. The script simply gave her a note by Anno:
     <i key="fb2fa870-34cf-4c0f-8e87-43acbfb96c5f">
      "Mitsuishi-sama, I look forward to working with you. Respectfully yours, Anno."

Misato's displayed behavior at this point implies that she may either perceive him as her enemy or has a terrible grudge against him for the Third Impact that he unintentionally caused.

     's ambitions were never to prevent Third Impact, but rather to provoke it. This of course, drove Misato and the others to rebel against him. Gathering the rest of the survivors of humanity, they formed the WILLE organization with her and Dr. Akagi as its leaders that dedicated exclusively to destroy NERV and SEELE to prevent future Impacts and ensure the future of the dying human race. Although Misato's motives and goals are just, the 14 years of constant war and struggle have hardened and deteriorated Misato's better qualities as a person and has resulted in her becoming ironically similar to Gendo. Even with shades of her former self, it's likely the Misato that Shinji knew is gone forever.

She commands WILLE to the last attack to NERV in the the Antartic, where the Second Impact happened. There, they engage in battle against the NERV ships commanded by Fuyutski, as Gendo Ikari expected.

She orders the crew to evacuate and singlehandedly pilot the Wunder against the Evangelion Imaginary to allow the Wunder's vertebral spine to cross to the Minus Space and become the Spear of Gaius for Shinji, sacrificing herself in the process. It is implied that after that, she comes back to life, and goes to Kaji's farm, alongside him, thier son, and Kaworu.

     While heading NERV efforts against an Angel, Misato witnessed the arrival of the Autobots and was perplexed by their presence. Mode "Eva" chapter 1 When Starscream possessed the Angel, Misato called for Eva-01 to be activated. Mode "Eva" chapter 2 However, she was in for another surprise when Optimus Prime scanned Eva-01 and became like it in both color and size! Mode "Eva" chapter 3 Misato watched the ensuing battle between Optimus and Starscream, noting that the Decepticon had access to the Angels' A.T. Field ability and radioing the Autobot Wheeljack to let him know NERV was relying on them, having no other Evas ready for deployment. When the Autobots worked to catch Starscream off balance, she helped out by having Tokyo-3 transform around the Decepticon, causing him to stumble and allowing Prime to defeat him. After the battle, the Autobots joined NERV in defending Earth against Angels and Decepticons alike, something Misato viewed with mixed anxiety and expectation. Mode "Eva" chapter 4
