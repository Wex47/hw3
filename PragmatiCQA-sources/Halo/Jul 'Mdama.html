   Sanghelios
   should be run now that the war was over, while his wife, Raia, was more concerned how the Sangheili race would rebuild in agriculture and engineering. When

   Avu Med 'Telcam
   , leader of a religious sect known as the
   Servants of the Abiding Truth
   which believed Thel 'Vadam to be a traitor and a heretic due to his efforts for peace with humanity, and his proposed resolution to the growing problems. Jul and his friend,
   Forze 'Mdama
   , traveled to the state of
   Ontom
   to stage a

   and plan the Arbiter's assassination alongside 'Telcam and his armed forces. He managed to get several Sangheili shipmasters to agree to his terms and steal the

  <p key="81405dca-92c4-446b-b997-99ba6cc3bf47">
   While agreeing with 'Telcam's views on the Arbiter, he began to grow suspicious of the source of munitions and weapons 'Telcam was receiving to strengthen the Servants. During one of 'Telcam's supply runs, Jul followed him to
   New Llanelli
   to observe 'Telcam meeting with one of his suppliers, which turned out to be

   Naomi-010
   . Jul was taken prisoner by Kilo-Five and brought aboard the

  </p>
  <p key="f4f78fbb-1299-4fb2-b3d4-994861df2e9c">
   During Jul's time on ONIRF Trevelyan, he was kept prisoner in the newly erected camp on the
   <a href="Shield World.html" key="83ee672d-d232-4cc2-bcb1-0777045830d7" title="Shield World">
    Shield World
   </a>
   and subjected to some degree of interrogation by ONI scientists. Jul was eventually allowed to wander the Shield World but only when accompanied by
   Prone To Drift
   and whilst wearing a rigged explosive vest similar to one that Huragok were forced to wear by the Covenant.
  </p>
  <p key="013ed540-1620-43c1-99a1-6559ac71b843">
   Whilst held prisoner on the Shield World, Jul was fed genetically engineered food developed by ONI that could potentially be used as a biological weapon against the Sangheili. This food caused Jul to suffer from nausea, and vomiting.
  </p>
  <p key="f80c6d47-092e-48f8-b080-ffbd28894818">
   Through mimicking his human captors, Jul would eventually glean information from Prone To Drift about the location of the
   Ur-Didact
   , as well as information detailing a system of portals from the Shield World to other Forerunner artifacts across the galaxy. Even though Jul was told of the danger of using these portals, he still viewed them as his best possible chance of escaping ONI clutches. Using the Huragok's instincts to protect Forerunner technology, Jul was able to force Prone To Drift into removing his explosive vest then jumped into the active portal.
  </p>
  <p key="b95c8921-8645-4f12-bc56-e1b8d748b39e">
   Jul appeared on the Sangheili colony world of
   Hesduros
   , where he met
   Panom
   and several youngsters. It turned out that these colonists had lost contact with the Covenant about a year prior, and had no knowledge of the Great Schism or the end of the war. Jul asked the locals to help him contact his keep. Jul then learned that Raia and Forze were both killed by the Arbiter's forces while fleeing Sanghelios after the failed assault on
   Vadam Keep
   , despite Kilo-Five's attempt to defend their vessel (under the guise of a Kig-Yar privateer).
  </p>
  <p key="833119d9-ef66-4331-8085-f578c0d3a92a">
   This news crushed Jul's soul and he asked to be left alone for a while. One of the youngsters approached Jul as he was admiring the Forerunner relics on the planet and explains to him the Forerunner symbols that were encrypted on Jul's belt. They show Jul a second holy gate where he finds the same symbols that were on his belt; the symbols for the Didact and coordinates to
   Requiem
   . Panom and the others, religious as they are, believe that the Forerunners sent Jul to Hesduros to find the Didact and bring him back to them. They agree to help Jul with whatever ships they can spare and to avenge his wife.

Scanning John-117, Requiem opened a massive portal in its metallic shell to the planet within, trapping all nearby Covenant ships along with the Dawn within a powerful gravity well.

Jul ordered his troops to invade the UNSC Science Bases Copernicus. Jul sent Glassman to this particular location for him to figure out how to activate the shrine which housed The Librarian in exchange for his life.

Jul 'Mdama was sighted at almost every location but managed to teleport from one place to the other in order to escape the Spartans. Crimson followed 'Mdama through all the portals, eventually cornering him in a Forerunner construct. However, large numbers of Covenant and Promethean forces occupied the Spartans to give Jul enough time to escape through another portal. The Spartans desperately made their way through the constant firefights, even targeting air strikes on Jul's location. Despite their efforts, Jul managed to make it through the teleporter. Unfortunately for him, however, while he was rushing to get away, he dropped what Crimson Team described as "the Didact's gift."

  <p key="2abdd8ce-d537-4143-8f27-de234ebb3ec5">
   This infuriated Jul and he immediately sent numerous

As his subordinates bowed down in admiration, Jul assumed that the Librarian has been awakened and reach out to touch the shrine, but the shield repulsed him. Jul then noticed that Glassman had taken advantage of his distraction to run off and assumed that the human had tricked him. As his men went in search of Glassman, Gek promised to deal with him personally. However, Glassman managed to escape with the aid of Spartan-IV

In an unknown region of space, Jul accused Halsey, whose left arm was amputated to keep her from bleeding to death, of betraying him by giving the other half of the Key to Thorne. Halsey defended that was before she knew the UNSC attempted to assassinate her and was willing to work with Jul to get her revenge.
