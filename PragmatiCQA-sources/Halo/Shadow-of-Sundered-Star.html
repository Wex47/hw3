As the outnumbered Spartans fought for their lives, Static flew down to protest the Didact's continued manufacturing of Promethean Knights in direct violation of their compact. The Didact assured the Monitor that his Prometheans would be moved to Requiem soon. However, the Monitor was more concerned that he used unwilling humans to make them. The Forerunner proceeded to grab the Monitor and order him to fulfill his end of their bargain. The monitor obliged and teleported the Halo over to the Forge. The Didact then returned to the ring to affect repairs and replace the Composer, planning on firing it near Earth to wipe out humanity. The Spartans managed to follow him back, but the Didact merely swept Blue Team aside and prepared to kill them. However, the Master Chief managed to sneak up behind the Didact and stab him in the right eye. Intending to kill the troublesome Spartan once and for all, the Didact grabbed the Master Chief by the helmet, lifted him off the ground and began to squeeze.

   Blue Team attacked the Didact, forcing him to throw John aside. The Didact easily overpowered the Spartans, knocking them all to the ground. However, before he could finish them off, the Monitor attacked him from behind and then transported him into Installation 03's control room. When he regained consciousness, the Master Chief entered and put the Index into the control panel. The Didact asked if the Master Chief intended to fire the ring just to kill him. He said he had thought of it, but didn't want to also kill all life in 25,000 light years around the ring. Instead, he had
   859 Static Carillon
   deactivate Installation 03's fail-safes and detach a section of the Halo, which fell to the planet below, impacting the Composer's Forge and presumably destroying the five Composers stored there. John-117 was teleported to safety by Static Carillon, while the Didact was disintegrated by the over-lapping pulses released by the Composers upon their destruction. However, John later told the UNSC that he believed the Didact was only "contained", not dead.
