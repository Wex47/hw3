   Thomas Lasky
   brought in
   Catherine Halsey
   to determine what the artifact was.
   Thorne later volunteered to guard her while she was performing her study. Out of curiosity, he questioned her regarding the use of children in the

  <p key="a9c6557f-877c-4fd1-b08b-3202e7099184">
   Halsey then changed the subject, asking Thorne why he became a Spartan. The latter admitted that he enlisted in the program to stop incidents like New Phoenix from happening again. Halsey points out that he's here on Requiem, shooting at Prometheans, and reminds him of the Greek myth of Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity. Though Halsey suggested that the Prometheans have so much to offer, Thorne disagreed, viewing the Prometheans as murderous Forerunner AIs.

   Majestic was later redeployed to Requiem to retrieve a package called "the Didact's Gift." Unfortunately, they are pinned down by
   Jul 'Mdama's Covenant
   aerial forces. Though DeMarco planned on taking off, Madsen stopped him, knowing that they'd be shot down. Thorne passed the package to Hoya as he hijacked a

   so Halsey could analyze the package, noting its similarity to an AI matrix. Suddenly, it emitted a burst of orange light, projecting images of New Phoenix on the monitors. Halsey determines that these are human memories and confronts Lasky. The Captain admitted that the UNSC has been aware that the Prometheans are ancient humans transformed into AIs by the Forerunners. Halsey corrected that this Promethean once lived in New Phoenix. As Lasky expressed confusion as to how these memories got to Requiem, Thorne noticed an image of the artifact and left the room. After Lasky and Palmer arrested Halsey for withholding information, Thorne later entered the room containing the artifact. Without even thinking, he touched it and was absorbed by it and is transported to
   Requiem
   just like Glassman.
   Upon arrival, he is surrounded by a host of

   before deciding to play possum. As they distract themselves by catching an escaping Glassman, Thorne took the opportunity to relieve a Sangheili of his Storm Rifle before using it to kill them both. Unfortunately, a host of Sangheili started charging towards them with Glassman's explosive vest being remotely armed. Thorne managed to tear the vest off Glassman and threw it at the Covenant as they managed to clear the explosion. The Sangheili Shipmaster
   Jul 'Mdama
   then ordered his assassin,
   Gek 'Lhar

   The two made their way back to Galileo Base. As they took a short rest, Gek ambushes them. Thorne fights hand-to-hand against his opponent. After knocking him down, he attempted to use a rock to crush Gek, but the Sangheili turned the tables and slammed the rock on Thorne's chest, knocking the wind out of him. As Gek grasped his energy sword to finish off the Spartan, Majestic appeared and shot him in the back, killing him. They then looted his body.

   Janus Key

By the time the Spartans managed to destroy the Knights, Jul teleported away, with Halsey in tow. After yelling in frustration, Palmer demanded to know why Majestic is here. DeMarco explained that they're on a rescue mission, Palmer retorted that Halsey is a traitor. However, Thorne didn't believe so as he shows the Commander his half of the Key.
