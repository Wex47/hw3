    The Rubble

   was a settlement in the
   23 Librae

   moved together and connected by docking tubes,

   Hesiod

   . The Humans that lived on the Rubble were either Insurrectionists, sympathizers, or surviving colonists from the UNSC world
   Madrigal
   . The habitats were made up of many asteroids that were linked together with docking tubes. Each of these asteroids had its own means of propulsion, and they were kept together by the machinations and calculations of the "smart" A.I. Juliana. She had been operating far past her normal
   7
   year life span and was approaching rampancy, but she had to remain in operation because the tasks that she performed were too difficult for humans.

  <p key="3f39de2f-6bea-4a0f-88a1-2e17cf4a98b1">
   The station was home to several ships that had navigational data that led back to
   Earth
   . After the enactment of the
   Cole Protocol
   , Spartan Gray Team was sent to the Rubble to eliminate the data. In the end, only one set of nav data managed to survive this event.

   The Rubble survived for several years. However, eventually the Kig-Yar betrayed the humans and planned to attack them. In response, Juliana ordered the citizens to evacuate into the Exodus Project, and worked in concert with the Spartan Gray Team and the crew and ODSTs of the UNSC frigate

   In the Rubble's final moments, part of it was moved by the AI Juliana into a position which would cause the moon
   Metisette
   to collide with it.
   The Habitat, codenamed the "Exodus Project," was transported via slipspace to the
   18 Scorpii system
   , where it disintegrated to form a debris ring around the colony world of
   Falaknuma
   .
   The exact date of destruction is unknown; however, the event took place in the year
   2535

   The Rubble's government was a democracy that allowed all of the residents to vote on everything. They would allow anyone to become Rubble citizens, although all UNSC military personnel that were captured had to swallow a motion tracker in the form of a pill that will let the Rubble's AI to track their location. They would also have to report for counseling and would be assigned a case officer that would review the integration process. While Juliana was supposed to abide by the Council's rullings, she was able to act on her own at will and defied the Council to aid the UNSC and Spartan forces on the Rubble as she felt it was in the Rubble's best interests despite what the Council believed.

   The Rubble had no official military force but instead had the
   Rubble Defense Force
   , which was essentially a glorified militia. The defense force was controlled by the Rubble Security Council and kept its weapons and munitions on
   Habitat Greenworthy
   . The asteroids were also protected by a number of
   Mass drivers
   as well as a small space fighter force. Despite this, the Rubble seemed to lack a real offensive force or even a real warship that wasn't a converted freighter.
