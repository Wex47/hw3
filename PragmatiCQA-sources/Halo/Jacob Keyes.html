   Captain Keyes was born on Earth and spent some time around the
   Pacific Ocean
   during his early childhood. At some point in his life he read
   work
   by
   Elias Carver
   , but considered his view of the situation in the colonies to be pessimistic. Keyes attended Officer Candidate School (OCS). During his second year of training, an incident occurred where fourteen ensigns were killed due to an instructor's error during a poorly planned test. Keyes suffered
   plasma
   burns during the test and had to be rehabilitated in a hospital for two months. Keyes refused to testify against the instructor and was nearly demoted for it. Keyes' refusal to testify is what sparked Catherine Halsey's interest in the then Lieutenant Junior Grade Keyes.

   when those orders were rescinded and he was chosen by Dr. Catherine Halsey to assist her with the task of studying approved subjects for her

   project. Keyes was chosen by Halsey for this assignment partly because he could "keep a secret." In order to fool anybody who was suspicious, they told them that they were looking for a school for their daughter, and so they both began observing the chosen subjects for the program. The first child they observed was SPARTAN-II subject 117, or
   John-117
   . Later, he expressed doubts when Halsey actually let
   Soren-066
   choose whether he wanted to become a Spartan, saying it was an "awful lot to lay on a child, even one who's grown up so fast."
   Keyes never forgot this assignment or the names of any of the children.

  <p key="65e92a69-3416-4587-b943-7623b34b836e">
   As Keyes slowly started learning of the true nature of the SPARTAN-II project, Dr. Halsey immediately sent him back to normal duty with a full
   Lieutenant
   commission
   and he became an excellent strategist, especially in dealing with the Covenant. At some point in the early 2520s he had a relationship with Dr. Halsey which resulted in the birth of their daughter Miranda Halsey who later changed her surname to Keyes.
   Early in the Human-Covenant war, he became a widely known hero when he led a small group of security troops against the Covenant ambush of the frigate

   He later toured on the Stealth
   Frigate

   . Captain Keyes garnered many citations and years of combat experience against the Covenant during these tours. During one of these tours, Keyes went to
   Charybdis IX
   . There, he killed his first human being with a modified
