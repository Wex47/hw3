   Only moments later, Truth's fleet arrived, and as ordered by Truth, the Jiralhanae assumed command of the remainder of Regret's ships, battling UNSC forces within
   New Mombasa
   and briefly occupying the city. In addition, they killed any remaining Sangheili troops still stationed on or above the planet. On the same day, as more Covenant warships began to arrive, Truth's fleet started excavating the Forerunner structure by

   After the Humans and Sangheili contained the Flood on Earth, a joint UNSC-Sangheili effort, consisting of at least three UNSC frigates, and the
   Fleet of Retribution
   , consisting of nine Sangheili cruisers and an
   assault carrier
   , managed to follow the Covenant ships a few hours after their initial retreat through the portal. Upon arriving above the Ark, Truth's Fleet engaged the Fleet of Retribution, backed up by the UNSC Frigates. While Truth's fleet outnumbered the Separatists three to one, the Separatists' tactics proved superior, eventually obliterating the entirety of Truth's fleet. Together with the total defeat of the Loyalist forces on the Ark itself during the
   Battle of Installation 00
   and Truth's death at the hands of the Arbiter, this signalled the end of both Truth's fleet and the Human-Covenant war.
