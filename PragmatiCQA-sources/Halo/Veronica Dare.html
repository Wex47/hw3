   to partake in her mission.
   The admiral was hesitant at first, but was forced to fulfill her request, seeing she was actually an
   ONI Section One
   operative and therefore did not report to the
   Fleet
   .

  <p key="af211466-7d2d-4017-a867-2a65266c9440">
   At one point
   before the drop, Dare called the
   NMPD Headquarters
   , asking the
   Communications Duty Officer
   there to go against
   the commissioner
   's orders and turn the Superintendent back on. They soon started an argument, and after Dare threatened to fire the officer, the enraged communications officer hung up on her.

   Moments before the ODSTs' drop, Dare; wearing an

   , causing some confusion among the squad members,
   and told him that attacking the
   Carrier
   was not their mission anymore.
   During the drop, she ordered the squad to change their

   , damaging the city and releasing a large
   EMP
   wave which disabled the pods' electronic systems and scattered them around the city. Dare's pod landed in
   Tayari Plaza
   . However, she was stuck in her pod, so she radioed Buck for help. But when he arrived at her location, her pod was empty; he presumed her dead when he saw her helmet in the grasp of an

   found it later.

   Six hours after the drop, Dare had made her way to sub-level 9 of the

   data center
   . Following her trail was the Rookie; Dare was surprised to see him. With him, she makes her way to the core, explaining to the Rookie that their original mission was to retrieve crucial information that the Superintendent has on

   prior to the Covenant invasion. The mission, however, would've been suicide to go alone, as Dare needed a team behind her. As there were only two ODSTs battling through Covenant forces, Dare was impressed with the Rookie, amazed he survived alone in the city.
  </p>
  <p key="a46dd896-0f03-49da-b821-3f36426b4bba">
   When they got to the Data Center, she discovered an
   Engineer
   that she initially believed was trying to harm
   Vergil
   . Upon further investigation, she had realized the Engineer was actually trying to help the Superintendent by repairing it. Her investigation also led her to believe that the Engineer was assimilating the Superintendent's data in order to help the UNSC discover the Covenant's intentions for the city. With the data secure inside the Engineer, the Rookie and Dare began an attempt to evacuate it to the surface.
  </p>
  <p key="72d2ce0b-f554-4db0-a05b-3ff6ef0b1d3d">
   The trio rendezvoused with Buck, who had figured out where Dare was, just as the

   </a>
   start swarming the core. Once they reached an elevator, Dare punches him in the face for "abandoning the mission." Buck complained that she was missing and his squad was scattered, only for Dare to spontaneously kiss him for coming back; they both became embarrassed with the Rookie and Vergil looking on. Upon getting back to the surface, already a Covenant armada comes out of

   over
   New Mombasa
   . Dare was dismayed that Buck neglected to mention it; he snapped that he was too busy watching out for Vergil; they argue to the point where Dare confesses that she'd thought she'd never see him again. Vergil then grabs their attention by getting into an

    helmet, which to some appears disproportionate. However, Bungie has said that her helmet is entirely proportional to her body. The illusion of disproportion may be due to the helmet being seen on Spartans, whose armor is much thicker than that of ODSTs. Another reason for the supposed disproportional helmet could possibly be that Dare wears no shoulder pad armor, making the helmet appear bigger than it should be. Her choice of light armor also contributes to this illusion. Contrary to the above misconception, Dare's armor is actually smaller in comparison to the other 5 ODST armors available for Firefight mode.
