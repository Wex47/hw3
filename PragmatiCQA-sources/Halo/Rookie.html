   Gage Yevgenny
   , a veteran ODST that had gone against orders to save a crowd of
   civilian

  <p key="e9d85cfe-6673-48db-a220-e67f6f281aab">
   Gage, who knew he was dying, told the Rookie his life story, right up until he crashed the Pelican. The Rookie, who had listened intently, promised to remember Gage and do whatever he could against the

   Six hours later, the Rookie woke up in his pod, which had been lodged into a building in the occupied
   city center
   of New Mombasa. The Superintendent had been monitoring him and waiting for him to wake up. As the Rookie dropped to the streets below and started to move on, the Superintendent provided him with valuable help, activating signs to guide him to safety and uploading a map of the city to his
   VISR
   database. As the Rookie explored the city, he tried to piece together clues to find out what happened to his squadmates while avoiding the numerous Covenant patrols in the city.

  <p key="2d43bfdc-9106-453e-91b5-4fe70178c5d8">
   After deducing the events of the previous six hours, the Rookie picked up a message from Dare, requesting assistance in the
   New Mombasa Data Center
   . Upon reaching the Underground, the Rookie learned she was on Sublevel 09. After reaching a Data Stack, he ran into a
   NMPD Officer
   attempting to check on his men; however, the Superintendent wouldn't let the officer onto the next level until the Rookie arrived at his location. The two fought their way through Covenant forces and reached the Data Stack to the next level, though the officer was either killed by
   Yanme'e
   or by the Rookie in self-defense (depending on whether or not all Audio Logs have been collected).

   After fighting through more Covenant, the Rookie finally arrived at Dare's location, where she told him of her mission: to retrieve the data the Superintendent recorded during the Prophet of Regret's attack on the city. Dare and the Rookie were forced to fight their way through an entire Drone hive, as well as other assorted Covenant. They found a

   Vergil

   The Rookie then reunited with Buck and proceeded to assist Dare and Vergil in their escape from the Data Center. After fighting past a Covenant outpost and up another
   elevator

   In 2554, the Rookie was sent to Draco III along with the rest of Alpha Nine to quell Insurrectionist activity that had flared up in the area since the Human Covenant war had ended. The team had been able to reach the colony's capital building, where the rebels had barricaded themselves, but were lured into the legislative room and trapped in a killzone.

  <p key="51cd9ff5-c1b3-4387-99c4-7cd6cee672ba">
   Sergeant Buck sent the Rookie towards the only way out of the room, an emergency exit, while the rest of Alpha Nine covered him, but the Rookie was unable to fight his way past the Insurrectionist forces to rescue his companions, instead was wounded in a shoulder and taken prisoner by the insurrectionists, being brought into a presidential address booth (which had one way shielding to protect it's inhabitants) as a hostage.

   Ingridson
   , during which the Rookie was shot in the knee, parts of Alpha Nine were able to flank around the presidential address booth.

   Ingridson was killed seconds after the Rookie's death, and the insurrectionists were all killed or captured shortly. As the Rookie didn't have any known friends or family outside of his squad, his burial at sea over the waters of Draco was attended only by the other members of Alpha-Nine.
  </p>
  <p key="6a43b6b7-b707-4c6b-9649-1ae545a50280">
   The Rookie's death had long standing consequences: Romeo blamed Mickey for his death, and the group's harmony was lost. Soon after, Alpha Nine was disolved when Buck, Romeo and Mickey joined the
   SPARTAN-IV program
   . The guilt made Mickey easily recruited by a group of Insurrectionists, betraying his two mates, but he failed and was captured.
