   Though the Jiralhanae retained their pack and tribal culture, their constant internal feuds began to take a back seat as enmity with the Sangheili built up, caused by the similarity in roles between the two species. Though the Jiralhanae retained the majority of their pre-Covenant technology, they also began to incorporate aspects of Covenant technology into their own designs, such as mounting plasma cannons onto their
   Prowlers
   , vehicles with a strong Jiralhanae aesthetic but with some Covenant technology. The Jiralhanae have little need to learn the languages of other species, instead of relying on translation devices.

   One Jiralhanae Chieftain,
   Lydus
   , helped the UNSC and Sangheili on the Arbiter's side break a peace agreement. He was one of the few Jiralhanae that was actually willing to help their most hated rivals, the Sangheili, and the humans whom they had fought with for over 25 years.

   Jiralhanae are large, bipedal xeno-mammals of simian origin and have been said to resemble large gorillas, but, in some ways, they also resemble ursine, or rhinoceros as well. They have thick, gray skin, and are covered with matted, black, tan, or brown fur-like hair and some have short, black, or brown colored beards. Their large, stocky appearance is most likely due to the gravity on their planet, which is about twice the gravity of that on

However it should be noted that John-117 and the other Spartans were suffering from the non-stop combat they had endured since the battle of Reach, with John-117 sustaining, in Doctor Halsey's words, "Burns, brain damage, fractures, and internal bleeding." The other Spartans involved in the fight had sustained various injuries from falling over two kilometers at terminal velocity onto Reach's surface. It appears that their physical strength cannot be accurately quantified. However, in

   Unlike the Sangheili, who are masterfully skilled tacticians, the Jiralhanae combat mentality relies on overwhelming force, sheer strength, and incredibly strong firepower, hence the name "Brutes."
