   He was present when the

    the Oracle of the Dreadnought
   </a>
   to give its blessing to their intent to become the next Prophet Hierarchs. In response, the Oracle attempted to launch the Dreadnought in order to transport the

   The Philologist, overcome with spiritual awe, beseeched the Oracle to complete its task; however, when the Dreadnought's electrical pathways were short-circuited by the

   worms that had been moving within them, thus stopping the Dreadnought's launch, the Philologist regained enough sense to disconnect the Oracle from the Dreadnought's systems.
  </p>
  <p key="4b8d763c-80b5-4ec2-b33a-6ec4af157dda">
   Because the Philologist had heard the Oracle's secrets, which would shatter the Covenant if they became known (it was thought that the Forerunners had transcended when they activated the
   Halo Array
   ; if the humans had been left behind, that meant that not all who walked the divine path would necessarily gain the same transcendence upon the coming of the
   Great Journey
   ), the other two Prophets offered for him to be their third Hierarch. The Philologist agreed, if perhaps reluctantly; he was later seen picking irritably at his new robes during the Hierarch initiation ceremony. With his help (doubtlessly his former career as a member of the High Council was very helpful for their campaign), the three San'Shyuum successfully rose to the mantle of Hierarch. The Philologist chose the title of Prophet of Mercy.

   After the

   , the
   Commanding Sangheili
   who was responsible for the loss of the ring, was brought before Mercy, Truth, Regret (attending as a hologram) and the
   High Council
   to be trialed for his failure. Upon confirming there was only a single ship fleeing Reach and its glassing, Mercy angrily questioned why it wasn't destroyed with the rest of the human ships. As the council created an uproar, Mercy attempted to calm down the Council. Mercy would come to witness Truth declare Thel a Heretic as he was escorted away, by Tartarus and his Jiralhanae.

   Later, an obviously displeased Tartarus was ordered to bring Thel in front of Truth and Mercy. Initially Tartarus had thought the disgraced Sangheili was to be executed, however Truth and Mercy had other plans. As an effort to help Thel regain his lost honor, The two Prophets allow Thel to take on the armor of the

   Responding to Thel's mentioning of the Councils wanting him dead, Mercy mentions the tasks that were to be undertaken by the Arbiter were to be suicidal, and he would die as all others had before him.

   While Regret's attack on Earth had failed and resulted in him being chased by the UNSC to

   's hands, Mercy alongside Truth had given the Arbiter who had returned successfully from his last mission, a new assignment. Mercy stated that while feeling satisfied with the continued killing of humans, they had felt sorrow after the destruction of one of the rings. He would reveal that the Prophets had questioned the captured
   343 Guilty Spark
   about the Halos; and became aware of the
   Activation Index
   required to activate them. With this information Truth and Mercy assigned the Arbiter to a new mission; obtain the
   Sacred Icon
   at any cost.
   Tartarus was also ordered to assist in the capture of the Sacred Icon; however he was secretly ordered to kill the Arbiter, and acquire the Index himself.

   Mercy can be seen as passionate, wise, and knowledgeable, as seen in the cutscene before the level
   Sacred Icon
   where he shows his excitement about
   Halo
   , expressing hope that the
   Great Journey
   should begin very soon. It's very possible that he has a sense of propriety, seeing that he talked Truth out of condemning Regret, as described on the level
   Regret
   , but that doesn't necessarily mean that he is merciful. He is perceptible and an authority on the
