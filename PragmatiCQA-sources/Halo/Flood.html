   As the
   Forerunner-Precursor war
   drew to a close, the few remaining Precursors that were pushed out beyond the edges of the galaxy to
   Path Kethona
   sought vengeance against the Forerunners. A few Precursors were spared by the Forerunners, while others became a dust which could regenerate into their past forms. Over time this dust became so corrupted that it could only cause horrific disease and mutation. The Precursors, driven insane by the rebellion of their creations, embraced this corruption and became part of it, becoming the Flood to destroy the Forerunners as a final act of vengeance against them.
   They sent several ships containing this powder to Forerunner controlled planets.

   by an Ancient Human empire 10,000 years prior to the Forerunner-Flood war. The earliest known instance of the highly infectious viral super cell later known as The Flood form to be encountered came in a fine desiccated powder, contained in cylinders. This powder was actually Precursor remains.
  </p>
  <p key="ed4ef7ba-b460-4b55-b1e8-e046f89381b0">
   Early experiments showed the potential for psychotropic effects in some lower levels but not in humans or

   . The primary animals affected were popular pets in human societies: the
   Pheru
   , lively and gentle creatures found on Faun Hakkor.
  </p>
  <p key="5603eb40-7915-4554-bf98-834732f0d393">
   Very small quantities of the powder induced changes in the Pheru that improved their domestic behavior. Soon San'Shyuum adopted the custom of taking Pheru as pets. For centuries humans and San'Shyuum bred and powdered these animals without ill consequences. However the powder soon attached itself to key points in the genes of the Pheru and began to change them, which manifested itself as a peculiar growth found on a third of the powdered Pheru.
  </p>
  <p key="cfebbe4d-ac66-462a-92a8-e29ebbf6a244">
   A kind of loose, soft fur grew between the shoulders of the pets. Other Pheru were soon found grazing on these companions, consuming their fur, and on occasion even consuming the animals themselves. This was odd, as Pheru were naturally herbivores. This seemed to activate some sort of signal for expansion. Within a very short time, the Pheru were producing far less attractive growths. Flexible striped rods sprouted from their heads, which in turn were also consumed by fellow Pheru, causing abortions and unnatural births.
  </p>
  <p key="ba93209c-64e0-444c-a8a5-1595e4df9199">
   But this was only the surface of the growing infestation.
   The Flood spread from the Pheru to Humans, specifically through the humans who ate the Pheru as food.  These new vectors forced their fellows to consume infected tissue and spread the infection to whatever they touched. In time, whatever they discarded - limbs, tissue - could also spread infection.
   The Flood continued to mutate and evolve and fought a war with both the

   Unknown to the Forerunners, the Human/San'Shyuum alliance had developed a way to combat and eventually defeat the Flood. By manipulating key strands of the Flood's genetic buildup, and infecting a third of the human population with this code, then placing them directly along the pathway of the Flood, the humans were able to alter the resultant Flood, causing it to turn upon itself. As a result, the Flood began to tear itself apart on a galactic level, further spreading the Human/San'Shyuum genetic weapon, and causing the Flood to wipe itself out.

   Knowing that it faced its own extinction, what remained of the uninfected, stable specimens fled the galaxy aboard a commandeered vessel and remained dormant for thousands of years, biding their time.
  </p>
  <p key="5cc9023f-6594-4101-b073-96e6ffb1584a">
   The Forerunners learned of the peril and as a precaution designed and subsequently constructed the Halo Network should the threat one day return. As expected, 10,000 years later, the Flood returned and began its conquest of total galactic domination.
  </p>
  <p key="af19fcff-c240-4c24-a214-89b3630e9fd7">
   After exhausting every other strategic option, the Halo Array was fired, resulting in the elimination of the original source of the Flood infestation and the death of every sentient being in the Galaxy, effectively removing both the source and its entire food supply.

  <p key="ce8429b0-04db-47e2-82d6-b0acbb2e7a10">
   With the formation of a Gravemind, the assimilated intelligence and memories of consumed hosts become part of a collective consciousness, which is capable of strategic thinking and commanding individual Flood forms in an organized manner.

   A Gravemind (like the Proto-Gravemind that gave rise to it) is the fusion of pure Flood Super Cells and the complex neuro-system of hundreds or thousands of sentients. The control it exerts over the more mobile forms it creates is likened to an entity's control over its own limbs. Therefore, during the Feral stage, control is localized at the individual level, but once an outbreak enters the Coordinated stage control is assumed by, and broadcast from, the central compound intelligence.

  <p key="17fdfd14-d526-49e7-8966-20cc3d77a918">
   Although little data exists from any adequately controlled experiment, data gathered in the field suggests that if a mobile form is removed from the influence of the Gravemind coordinating its group of origin it will revert to a Feral Stage. Insufficient data exists on whether mobile forms of one Gravemind would be influenced by another Gravemind, though logic dictates this would be the case. However, because individual Graveminds are more or less identical and are all striving for the same goal, it is likely that a distinction would be impossible to detect.

   The
   Bestiarum
   states that the society of the Flood closely resembles a "utopian socialist ideal as there is no wealth, no poverty, no want, no crime, and no disease; every individual works for the advancement of the Flood as a whole." It also states that it "is unfortunate that their one overriding goal is to [butcher and consume] every other life form in the galaxy."

   The Flood first entered the galaxy from the Large Magellanic Cloud at the edge of the Milky Way roughly 110,000 years ago, contained in cylinders in unmanned vessels where they were kept as a powder. A considerable amount of time passed between their initial discovery by prehistoric humans and their evolution into their current form. The Flood were eventually able to infect Human worlds, sparking the
   Human-Flood war
   . The Humans, who were losing worlds to the Flood, continually searched for new territory and went as far as to take Forerunner occupied planets or completely glass them if Flood infestation was detected. The Forerunners, seeing this as an act of aggressive imperialism rather than an attempt to hold to the Mantle, retaliated, precipitating the

   </a>
   . However, the Humans successfully developed a 'cure' for the Flood infection and were able to eradicate it before falling to the unmolested and more powerful Forerunner military. It would be thousands of years before they were again able to threaten the galaxy.

  <p key="d933c12a-c911-42a9-ad4f-25e8ec93b424">
   Unbeknownst to the humans, they had not actually found a cure; the Flood had chosen not to infect the humans instead; the former Precursors allowed the idea of a cure to gain credence, so that in the future more efforts would be diverted to attaining it rather than simply excising the infection. When the Flood returned, the Forerunners, who devolved and destroyed prehistoric humanity and their research, were entirely unprepared to challenge the Flood properly.

   More than 100,000 years prior to
   2552
   ,
   the Flood encountered a Forerunner research expedition on the planet
   G 617 g1
   . Initially, the Forerunners severely underestimated the potential threat this new life form posed, using tactics more suited to disease outbreak than true warfare. By the time the infection had begun to spread, the Flood had continued to grow in biomass and were a deadlier and more intelligent foe. The Flood used unarmed civilian assets to penetrate planetary defense groups, first striking at the Forerunner-held planet of
   LP 656-38 e
   , completely bypassing the Forerunner Orbital
   Fleet
   and infesting the planet below. They soon moved to similarly infest the planet
   DM-3-1123b
   . The sheer numbers of Flood forms on the planets overcame Forerunner ground forces. While at first the Flood demonstrated a lack of even basic group tactics, they had numerical superiority; billions of forms dedicated to the assault, and every member of the Forerunner population a potential Flood host. In desperation, the Forerunner's armada was ordered to immediately commence full planetary bombardment on infested worlds, although at a great cost - many Forerunners were unable to be evacuated before bombardment commenced, leaving the Forerunner military with shallow victories. In events where the naval garrisons were unable to commence bombardment, major Forerunner population centers appeared to activate localized weapons of mass destruction, effectively committing mass suicide, but stopping the growing infestation.
  </p>
  <p key="08d30e71-8ebf-4b38-99c3-5bab8abfc132">
   Thereafter, the Forerunners realized that ordinary naval tactics were unable to stem the growing tide of the Flood, and decided to pin their hopes of defeating the Flood on super-weaponry. While the Forerunners initially deployed the

   The Flood grew exponentially, spreading from system to system with the intent to infect the Forerunner population rather than wage war with Forerunner battle groups. The Flood had reached sufficient proportions to create 'Key Minds' Enormous instances of Gravemind with a vast computational capacity that challenged even the Forerunners most powerful machines. The tide began to turn against the Forerunners; the overwhelming computational power of the Gravemind allowed it to outmaneuver the Forerunner Fleets. The Gravemind convinced the

The Marines assessed the area, finding no prisoneers, crew members or any signs of human life. Lopez suddenly noticed that Rabbit, a member of their squad, had disappeared.

Suddenly, they heard a screech, and Lopez radioed Cranker to check up on him. He tells her that the elites never showed, but a growl can be heard from his radio.

Lopez's group made a brief stop in a med bay to treat a wound one of the Marines had sustained earlier. The squad noticed a locked safe room, and after some persuasion, convinced the room's occupant, Dr. John Smith, to come out. Lopez asked him what happened to the ship and doubts his explanation that the prisoners escaped and overwhelmed the guards. She then asked him why there were Covenant prisoners on the ship, but Smith claimed to have no idea why. Lopez finally asked what the ship was doing there, but Smith had no knowledge of the reason. After she finished questioning him, Lopez informed Smith that the group was headed to the bridge to delete the ship's nav data. Smith said they needed to leave the ship immediately, but Lopez forced him to join the group as they continued their mission.

A Combat Form rose from the water and slashed another Marine before Benti killed it. While examining the Marine's wound she noticed and cut out a small maggot-like thing.

   Unlike on Installation 04, where the Sentinels had contained the Flood until the Covenant began to meddle with the Forerunner containment measures, on Installation 05, the Flood had been in continual war with the Sentinels since the firing of the Halos 100,000 years ago. It is unknown how. Like on Installation 04, the fresh suitable host bodies of a newly arrived Covenant armada and a UNSC strike force fueled the Flood's exponential parasitic capabilities, and Flood infestation increased at a surprisingly rapid rate, and within hours, Sentinel forces were being overrun, causing a risk that the Ring would fall to the parasite.

   the Library
   a high-priority target for the Flood: if it could control the Library and prevent any Reclaimer from entering, it would make itself essentially invulnerable. Installation 05's Library was nestled in a tenuous series of wintry and snowy canyons and boasted three levels of defense: an exterior

   While the first half of the Sentinel Wall had remained pristine, the second half, the one buttressing the Quarantine Zone, was infested by Flood. Sentinel resistance had been destroyed in some segments of the Flood-Infested Wall,
   and in heavily infested areas, the Flood appeared to be beginning to terraform the Forerunner facility, spreading murky spores into the air. The UNSC deployed a small number of Marines to fight through the Flood-Infested Wall, but they were quickly overrun. Thel 'Vadamee was able to battle through hundreds of Flood forms that had taken up positions in the Wall, which had entered through wall-mounted conduits, although later, the Covenant deployed a team of three Special Operations Sangheili in the lower levels of the Flood-infested Wall, although they were killed as well. Finally, Thel 'Vadamee was able to make his way out of the Wall, emerging at the ground levels: the Quarantine Zone.

Eventually, they reached the top and Guilty Spark opened the door for them. As they hurried to the Control Room, the Gravemind began talking to John-117 again, and Cortana realized that the Gravemind was trying to rebuild its damaged form. As the four went in, the Gravemind tried to follow them with Combat forms, but was locked out. However, the Gravemind was able to regroup when 343 Guilty Spark went rampant following Johnson's attempt to activate the Halo ring prematurely, mortally wounding Johnson and locking the Arbiter out of the room. Guilty Spark then did battle with John-117, using a powerful hard-light beam that easily drained John's shields. Johnson, still alive, shot Spark with his Spartan Laser, before handing it to John while the Monitor recovered from the unexpected attack. Finally, John destroyed Guilty Spark and activated Halo using the Index that Cortana saved from the first Installation 04. The Gravemind, realizing that there was very little chance of survival, attempted to stop John and Thel 'Vadam from escaping Halo. However, the Gravemind's forces were still battling Sentinels, leaving few Combat Forms to stop the two as they took Johnson's Warthog. Despite the Flood and Sentinal forces that stood in their way, John-117 and Thel 'Vadam were still able to make it onto UNSC frigate

   Despite John-117 destroying High Charity, parts of it still remained intact and remained in the Ark, where the Flood began to recuperate from their disastrous defeat on Installation 08, though the Sentinels quarantined the surrounding area to ensure they could not escape.

The Flood had accumulated enough biomass to create an especially large Proto-Gravemind, which was nearing critical mass to become a Gravemind.

   The Flood immediately took advantage of the naive Jiralhanae's clumsiness and began overwhelming Banished bases and scavenging operations, converting all they could find to fuel the Flood war machine. This in turn also allowed the Proto-Gravemind to expand further onto the surface. Although the two brothers fought bravely, they knew they were fighting a losing battle. Fortunately, Voridus was able to find a partially intact Forerunner facility. The Flood deployed numerous forms to stop him but failed. Sentinels began joining the fight against the Flood. When they reached the Proto-Gravemind, the brothers were able to weaken it slightly and send

He berated the two brothers, mostly Vordius, for the catastrophe that had occurred and ordered them to clean up their mess.

   It is extremely adaptive, and mutates hosts through different stages of accelerated "evolution," where the body of biomatter accelerates its own evolution to the point of a massive biological breakdown, whereby the infection can first take place.

   Infection forms selectively target other species that possess sentient intelligence and are of sufficient biomass, and can infest living or lightly wounded dead bodies. Infection forms have long tendrils that pierce the skin of the host and find their way to the spinal cord. They then synchronize with the host, matching frequencies with the host's nervous system and killing them almost instantly. From there, they take control of the host body, replacing whatever mind originally resided there with the ravenous and voracious psyche of the Flood, although certain higher-level cognitive abilities, such as combat techniques and technical knowledge which may be useful, are retained, scanned from the victim's brain after death. Despite this lingering of certain memories, no trace of the original mind's personality remains; only a simplistic and primal urge to assimilate or destroy other species drives the organism after infection. In isolated cases, such as when the Flood seek very specific information from an individual's mind, they utilize an alternate, undescribed method of infestation that does not kill the host immediately; this allows the Flood to "burrow" into the host's mind, eventually giving them access to the entire scope of the host's memories. This has only been specifically seen when the Flood sought information from Captain

   Higher-level species capable of combat, such as Humans, Jiralhanae, or Sangheili, are selectively infected to become Combat Forms. Combat Forms retain the general profile of their original species, although they are significantly mutated. Organ systems are corrupted, organ-specific functions are decentralized, and body cavities are decayed, making hitbox-selective incapacitation impossible; organ functions are decentralized, thus, decapitation does not kill a combat form. Furthermore, highly area-specific munitions, such as sniper rifle projectiles, are completely ineffective, as picking off selective areas of a combat form leads to no wide-scale physiological impediments, and the projectile will punch through the decayed flesh rapidly, exiting through the other side of the combat form without consequence.

   Combat forms also generate tentacles very quickly without regard for the skeletal structure of the host, with tentacles protruding from the combat form at odd locations, typically localized to the chest axial regions, such as the neck, armpits, or torso. A single arm is oftentimes mutated to a claw like or tentacle-like structure that splits into multiple angular, hand-like structures, replacing the hand's usage, though it will still be there. The musculature of the combat form dramatically changes as well, and the form is given prodigious arm and leg strength, allowing for heavy blows with its arm-like structures and for incredible speed and jumping height with its legs. The Flood are also prodigious climbers, able to scamper on walls with little hindrance to the organism . Metabolic requirements, however, appear to be extreme on the organism: blood vessels become extremely prominent on the surface of the Combat Form, with thick and distinct blood-colored vessels spawning all across the creature's surface, most prominently so on the head.

   There is no confirmed way to effectively prevent a Flood infection once an Infection Form infects a host, and there is no way to reverse the effects of flood infection.

It has been suggested that the scrambling of neural frequencies caused by Boren's Syndrome and similar conditions renders an Infection Form incapable of tapping into the host's nervous system to kill and infect him or her. The Infection Form is therefore unable to enact any large-scale physiological mutation; however, some Flood DNA is still spliced with the host's DNA, apparently imparting the host with enhanced regenerative capabilities. However, this is only speculation and has yet to be independently verified.

   Since the Flood is a parasitic life form, they depend on other organisms for survival. Thus, the only logical foolproof way to eliminate them permanently is to take away their food sources. The Forerunners attempted this by bombing large population centers, but this was seen as one of their last resorts and as such was performed too late in the war to make much difference. The absolute last resort was the use of the Halo installations, which effectively destroyed all life in the galaxy and starved the Flood into extinction. However, the Forerunners' plan included some measures to preserve sentient life and return them to their home planets, allowing the Flood's "food source" to persist. Unfortunately, at the same time, specimens of Flood spore cells were kept for analysis on the Halo Installations, allowing the threat of the Flood to be merely forestalled, not eradicated.

   The most basic form of Flood evolution is the infection form, unique in its distinctive spherical shape. The infection form is used to infect organisms of other species, physically adhering to their surfaces and inserting tentacles, forcibly "hacking" into its host's nervous system, completely changing its psychology to that of the Flood's, and eventually physiologically mutating it into one of the various parasitic Flood forms of whatever the victim may be. The Sangheili combat form may use the shield in the armor of the host. The Tank form is about the size of a Hunter, and can release Infection forms from its body. It can mutate into two different forms: Stalker form, and Ranged form.

  <p key="6c91b600-3b52-442b-9900-600f9ad047c8">
   While possessing an unusual sentient intelligence, with Combat Forms still retaining extremely high-level cognitive functions such as vehicular operation, traits such as dexterity and complex battlefield tactics are notably lacking in the Flood, especially in their psychological and combat behavior. While the Gravemind coordinates Flood strategy on a galactic scale, small encounters are not coordinated between individual Flood warriors.
  </p>
  <p key="9f56f1d8-fb78-4a1d-80ef-2f05db3f8229">
   The Flood's strategy is simple: They throw themselves at potential hosts in huge numbers with any and all weapons available. Flood tactics are based primarily on asymmetrical warfare: the Flood uses all of its different forms to kill any enemy it sees. Infection forms swarm across the battlefield in waves, reanimating any corpses they can find, while Combat forms attack and kill any hosts in sight. Pure forms, if present, provide support to Combat forms in a number of ways: Stalker forms move to strategic positions and mutate into either Tank or Ranged forms, which can destroy enemy vehicles or fortifications or provide suppressing fire from afar.

   The Flood have a strong preference for close-range combat: Combat forms possess abnormally strong melee attacks by whipping their tentacles, capable of lowering a Spartan-II Mjolnir armor’s shields to half power with a single hit. Carrier forms cause tremendous damage at close ranges, and their explosions are extremely devastating to friends and foes alike, with the added benefit of disseminating infection forms in the immediate vicinity. Infection forms are capable of attacking only at point-blank ranges, exploding in damaging bursts when meeting an opponent's personal

   or instantly grabbing hold of an unshielded enemy organism and infecting it. Combat forms can also use firearms, and have only ever been seen clutching them in one hand (regardless of whether it is one-handed or two-handed). However, combat forms struggle with ranged weaponry: it is believed that the neurological ramifications of Flood infection significantly decrease accuracy, as well as weapon recoil, if held in only one hand. The Flood are, on the other hand, very effective with heavy weaponry such as the
   M19 Rocket Launcher
   or the

   As mentioned previously, the Flood demonstrates a curious higher intelligence despite their poor combat aptitude and coordination. The Flood collectively learn any general information a species possess, even if only one member of that species is assimilated. For example, during the ill-fated raid on

   The Flood's millennia of existence has made the assimilation process extremely brief: hosts killed in a short firefight can be reanimated within seconds to minutes by an Infection form, and live creatures can be mutated into fully developed Combat forms within the same time frame. Sometimes the rate of the mutations can vary in extremely rare cases: when Rtas 'Vadumee battled his comrade-turned-Combat form Bero 'Kusovai aboard the
   <i key="c8572450-8c52-4482-8936-83e90ee32691">

   , 'Kusovai continued to mutate throughout the duration of the battle at a restrained and constant rate. Though never seen within the story, it can be assumed Infection forms were involved in infecting a victim. Before being killed to prevent him becoming a Flood Combat form, one of the Sangheili accompanying Rtas 'Vadumee had a wound in his chest that was consistent with the entry point for an Infection form.

  <p key="abc20f94-7e10-47e4-873d-b7cdb49a3c31">
   The Prophet of Truth, in his final moments, was infected by the Flood and began to mutate, but the rate and nature of his transformation was not consistent with the usual process when a sentient being is taken by a Flood Infection form. It is likely that this was influenced by the nearby Gravemind, who was either controlling the Infection form's activity, or controlling the mutation of the Flood spores within Truth's body.

The Magnum is capable of killing a combat form with a single shot to the chest, but is generally not recommended for mass engagement, as its medium rate of fire and small magazine size can lead the player into a position where they are surrounded by Combat Forms and need to reload. Therefore, it is best to apply it only in long-range combat. Furthermore, Combat forms have a tendency to revive after being shot once with a pistol. The

  <p key="5939b829-9a67-434a-b68f-56b5d14b5d6d">
   The Sniper Rifle is ineffective against Combat forms due to the Flood's organ-function decentralization. The Shotgun, on the other hand, is one of the best choices against Flood Forms, as it usually finishes them off in one or two shots, and prevents Combat Forms from suddenly rising up again.

   The Assault Rifle, an all-round effective weapon with large spread range, is superb against masses of Combat forms and Infection forms. Never bother to melee Combat Forms or Carrier Forms, as it is practically useless and very time consuming. For Infection forms however, a single melee can take down four to five of them.

  <p key="3b5b7bcf-9db7-40ef-8a29-6cfbc86b3773">
   All in all, the most practical option is to have a shotgun for close-up/quick work, and a Pistol or Assault Rifle for longer range. The pistol is most useful for the level

The method of killing a Combat Form in one shot in Halo 2 is still viable in Halo 3. However, the corpse will be susceptible to infection by another Infection Form unless the body destroyed.

They possess large tentacle-like Flood forms and large pods that can pin in and attack vehicles, in the case of the Elephants they capture, which is an objective to rescue in the
   first level where they are encountered
   in-game. The Flood establish bases by capturing and spreading an infestation on enemy bases.

   One of the newer, scarier aspects of the Flood developed for Halo Wars is their ability to transform sentient life with "Flood Spores"
   Certain units and Flood "Structures" when destroyed release what appears to be an intelligent cloud of green spores which swarm across nearby units.
   Once any unit has received contact for a long enough period of time (A matter of seconds in some cases) the unit is considered lost and becomes a Combat form.
   Tactically this completely changes the way in which a person has to think, rendering all infantry (save Spartans) completely useless in combat.

   The Flood have been confirmed by Ensemble to have been made overpowering to both UNSC and Covenant forces to keep their appearance terrifying. Early in development, Ensemble considered making the Flood a playable race, but this idea never made it past the concept stage. According to lead designer Graeme Devine, the main issue was that in order to balance the Flood with the UNSC and Covenant, the Flood would have to have been similar to StarCraft's Zerg, which did not mesh with the Flood's role in the games: to be "the single scariest thing in the galaxy."
