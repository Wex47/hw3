   . The Forerunners themselves were long vanished, but large amounts of their technology still existed. The Prophets wished to use the technology to search and explore the galaxy, but the Elites believed such usage to be a desecration of their holy artifacts. As the devastating war-ravaged both species, the Elites saw that the only way for them to win was to do the exact thing they opposed; use their own Forerunner technology to adapt and befit their vessels. The English word "Covenant" means "Religious Alliance" or "Binding Agreement" (between two or more parties), usually used to describe an alliance between a faction of men and a god, or between two factions of men with holy goals.  This name is well suited to the Covenant because of the "binding Covenant" formed between the two alien races, the Prophets and the Elites when the latter promised to defend the Prophets as they searched for the Sacred Rings which are said to start the "Great Journey."  The "Great Journey" is the term that the Prophets use to explain the disappearance of their gods, the Forerunner race.  The quest of the entire Covenant, the Great Journey is the basis of

   At first, the Covenant were mostly held together by a need to survive, but as their society advanced, so did their technology, culture, and religion.  Now the polytheistic Covenant control a large part of the Orion arm of the Milky Way galaxy and their society is a complicated caste system, with the Prophets still on top, governing the Covenant along with the Elites.  The Covenant is a theocracy, based on a prophecy about the Sacred Rings and the Great Journey.  The actual context of this prophecy is unknown, but the Prophets' faith in it is the reason for their yearning desire to activate the

   A theory is that the promise of the journey goes like this: The Forerunners were so advanced, that they had found a way to propel themselves to god-like status using their technology.  To oppose this, a race called the Flood attacked the Forerunners and attempted to stop the activation of this technology, for some unknown motive.  Before the Flood could stop them, the Forerunners activated the Halo array and ascended to godlike status.  The Covenant's goal is to find the Halo array and use it to propel themselves to godhood as well.

   by the Covenant) is a species of virulent, parasitic organisms that thrive by consuming other sentient life of sufficient biomass, no matter where in the universe, thus leading Forerunners to the creation of the Halo Array. The Flood appears to be a hive or communal mind, existing in several stages that eventually lead into the creation of a central intelligence known as the
   <a href="Gravemind.html" key="a0de86d8-bc50-429b-9160-b0e03fc75a22" title="Gravemind">

   . Next to nothing is known about their origin, except that they were created from something Precursor.  Whether they were an actual Precursor remains or created by the Precursors or both is unknown.  The Flood settled upon a Forerunner world, where they were found and subsequently battled. It has been revealed that humans discovered and then fought them while fighting the Forerunners until they were defeated by the Forerunners, who had no idea about the Flood, and devolved humanity after centuries of war leading to their solution, which didn't involve wiping the whole galaxy clean being lost.  Faced with the Flood spreading throughout the galaxy and consuming every sentient being, the Forerunners created twelve artificial Rings called the Halos.  The point of the Rings was to wipe out all sentient life, thus starving the Flood of any organisms of sufficient biomass to sustain them.  Through their own interpretation of Forerunner artifacts, the Covenant believed these rings were actually devices that allowed the Forerunner to transcend this plane of existence into godlike state, and sought to do the same by activating them once more, though doing so would wipe out all sentient life in the galaxy.     
Although it seemed the plan had been successful at eliminating the Flood threat, samples of the organism kept on the rings for study were released on at least two of the installations through accidental means, putting the Galaxy once again at risk of complete destruction by the scourge.

   The Flood grow and reproduce via the assimilation of other beings, using corpses and found biomass in order to spread. They are incapable of sexual reproduction, instead they fester inside a host until a certain time period, after which they explode and new Flood are given off.  Once a Gravemind is formed however, the Flood advance to a stage where they no longer require hosts for this, only biomass and calcium, which they require to feed on, and to build bodies with.  Once they have advanced, they create hives which can produce thousands of Flood inside large pustules on walls and other surfaces, which act as incubators.  During this stage, the Flood are able to build their own life forms using captured biomass and calcium deposits.  The Flood continue in this fashion recurrently until either everything is devoured, or until they are stopped, the former usually occurring.

   It is revealed that a large Forerunner artifact has been dug up under the African desert by the Covenant, and the Prophet of Truth is going to activate it. Presumably this is the Ark, so therefore this would activate the Halos, and so a hasty attack is set in motion by Lord Hood to destroy the Forerunner dreadnought with a surprise aerial assault. Master Chief clears Voi of all Covenant anti-air units to clear the path for Lord Hood's frigates for an assault on the dreadnought. However, the assault on the dreadnought has absolutely no effect, and Truth activates the artifact all the same. A large portal is created above the artifact, into which the Covenant forces disappear. Soon after, a
   derelict Covenant cruiser
   appears out of Slipspace, and crashes nearby, infested with Flood.

   John-117 and the Arbiter make their way toward the ship, and as they near its location, a group of Elite-controlled cruisers appear, striking up an alliance with the Humans and helping rid the city of Flood. Master Chief enters the ship and retrieves a message from Cortana, warning that High Charity is heading to Earth, full of Flood. It is decided that only the frigate

This leads to a trident strike at three shield generators guarding the Citadel at the heart of the Ark. Once all three generators have been deactivated, John-117 and the Arbiter breach the Citadel after Truth kills Miranda Keyes and forces

   After fighting their way up to the top of the Control Room, John-117 and the Arbiter enter the Control Room, and attempt to activate the ring. However, 343 Guilty Spark attempts to stop John and Johnson from activating the ring, saying that the charging sequence of the incomplete Halo will prove too much for the structure, and cause it to tear itself apart.
