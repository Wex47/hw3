   Janjur Qom

   Contemporary San'Shyuum, whose status of political figureheads who perform little physical work, most Prophets are physically frail creatures: this is due to them being descendants of the
   ancient Reformist San'Shyuum
   who were used to lower gravity of the

   Contemporary San'Shyuum prefer to move around using anti-gravity technology. A life of physical inactivity leaves most if not all Prophets withered and weak. They are capable of moving unaided, however: In the

   In stark contrast, the
   ancient Stoic San'Shyuum

   Each Prophet has distinct, often fur-covered lobes of skin hanging underneath their chin similar to a beard, known as "wattles."
   Prophets of greater age, for example the High Prophet of Mercy, have skin lobes on either side of their heads reminiscent of ears; despite this resemblance, the San'Shyuum actually receive sound at the back of the head. Older Prophets, such as the Prophet of Mercy, appear to lose the pigment in their skin as they age and turn a shade of grey, then white. Prophets have three digits on each hand, and are usually found wearing ornamental pieces that may also double as life support systems. These head-pieces bear a holographic representation of a Halo (indicating that the Covenant have known about the

   Little is known about the culture of the San'Shyuum. In an unknown time, before the Covenant was formed, a thousand or so pro-technology Prophets called
   Reformists
   left their homeworld in the

   , leaving the anti-tech
   Stoics
   , stranded.
   The resulting calamity meant that the Covenant San'Shyuum population was reduced to a few thousand, forcing the species to carefully manage their gene pool to prevent the loss of beneficial genes and the introduction of undesirable traits, with individuals possessing negative recessive traits placed in the
   Roll of Celibates
   to prevent their breeding. The Prophet of Truth is on such a list. However, if they should have such sexual urges, the Prophets will use concubines. If such a pregnancy should occur, however, they must be aborted, or the children will be killed at birth and the father sterilized.

   It is known that the fertility cycles of female San'Shyuum are short and few and far between, which would make it difficult for San'Shyuum to have children. As a result, they would hold a celebration called a
   Birthing Period
   when a child was conceived, which was very uncommon.

   With regards to naming practices, each San'Shyuum has a given name and a family name. However, once they rise to a certain level in the bureaucracy, they prefer to be addressed by their title.
   Upon their ascension, Hierarchs may select a regal name from a list of former High Prophets. For example, the Prophet Hod Rumnt is always addressed by his titles, such as Philologist or his regal name, the

   Like most members of the Covenant, the majority of San'Shyuum typically speak in a dialect of the Sangheili language, which is the
   lingua franca
   of the Covenant. Although they are known to have their own language, it is seldom used in comparison to the more pervasive Sangheili language.

   The San'Shyuum also used non-verbal communication, in the form of elaborate or simple hand gestures, though some involved movement of the head. Most other races such as Sangheili were completely unaware of this. The San'Shyuum were also able to convey expression through this hand gesture, such as irony, amusement, respect, empathy, and satisfaction. An extra flip of the thumb was being used mockingly. The Stoics on Janjur Qom seemed to have used the same hand gesture.

The two sides fighting in this war were called the
