   The ORION Project was a Special Operations Force in the UNSC. Administratively, the ORION project was under the control of ONI Section-III, the Special Projects section of ONI's Beta-5 Division. However the Orion super-soldiers themselves were under the operational authority of Naval Special Warfare Command/
   .
   The ORION Program was an all volunteer force composed of the most skilled members of the
   <a href="UNSC Marine Corps.html" key="1d954a3d-8755-438c-8eb1-ac6901c2c115" title="UNSC Marine Corps">

   and special forces branches of the military
   — the Orion super-soldiers performed specialized, high-risk operations including: counter-insurgency operations, unconventional warfare, direct action and black operations. The ORION program was headquartered on one of the many orbital docks on
   Reach
   ,
   and in the height of the program had 300 active duty personnel.
  </p>
  <p key="929d9fff-3f4b-4ebc-ad57-41432a1c9925">
   The members of the ORION program were all augmented soldiers, using new training methods and the latest breakthroughs in biochemical developments. Augmentations to the Orion super-soldiers include muscular enhancement injections, pulmonary respiratory enhancements, retina-inversion injections, and cochlea enhancement tuning.
   In addition to the physical enhancements, mental augmentations were performed to enhance brain functions
   including enhanced learning capabilities to allow a subject to learn at a faster and higher rate and enhanced motor skills to improve body movements. The Orion training regime was very difficult and included many tests both mental and physical, including work done in the lab. All sixty-five initial volunteers
   made it through the training and augmentation procedures and were placed on active duty some time after completing their training. After their initial deployment and success funding for training the next group of Orion super-soldiers was approved, and within a few years the Orion Program had 165 active duty personnel.

   began developing bio-engineering protocols and experimenting with biochemically altering human soldiers. Although these performance enhancing substances were very primitive and nowhere near as effective as the chemicals used to augment the soldiers of the SPARTAN Programs, they did show promise and gave results and serve as the catalyst for future endeavors. Since then, human soldiers have used performance-enhancing equipment for decades.

   mankind's expansion era had begun, and the next century would be an important boom for Humanity. As mankind expanded, the political and military power that the

   As the Colonies began to separate themselves from Earth, the UNSC took every step necessary to keep its grip on the

   As the civil wars began to intensify in the Outer and Inner colonies, many of the
   CMA's
   resources were taken over by the UNSC and ONI. Using data supplied by ONI, the CMA relaunched ORION in secrecy in response to insurgent attacks in the colonies. The project began in January of 2491
   with sixty-five test subjects, after completing their training an additional one-hundred volunteers were accepted into the now dubbed SPARTAN program. The first Orion deployment occurred in January 12,
   2496
   as part of
   Operation: CHARLEMAGNE
   , during this operation the full unit of Orion super-soldiers were deployed to recover the sub-orbital transit station over
   Eridanus II
   . This marked the only time a full unit of Spartans were ever deployed in the entire program — they completed their mission with only a single casualty and without being seen.
   The resulting success of CHARLEMAGNE, and tales of the military deploying advanced super-soldiers were born, this became fuel for a range of conspiracy theories and media speculation. As the legend of the super soldiers continued to grow they gave birth to a new round of propaganda efforts by ONI in the coming decades.

   As the war against the

   continued to escalate, the UNSC stepped up their counter-insurgent activities under Operation: TREBUCHET, created in response to the defector UNSC Marine Colonel

   The Orion super-soldiers became a key member in the fight against the rebel attacks across the colonies, taking down insurgents as soon as they cropped up — however as time went on the insurgent attacks became more effective, and insurgent personnel more difficult to root out, and over the ensuing decades, became more organized and difficult to combat.

   In
   2502
   ,
   Operation: KALEIDOSCOPE
   —part of the UNSC's greater plan to pacify the entirety of Human-colonized space, was put into action. Many Orion super-soldiers were deployed to take down insurrectionist strongholds, but one of the key goals was to eliminate
   Jerald Mulkey Ander
   , the leader of another major insurrectionist faction, the
   Secessionist Union
   . Although KALEIDOSCOPE successfully dealt a heavy blow to the insurgents, the overall strategy of KALEIDOSCOPE failed to pacify the colonies. Operation: TANGLEWOOD would be the last operation the Orion super-soldiers participated in, the exact nature of this operation is not known other than that it was to combat insurrectionist forces.
   In
   2506
   The Orion project was quietly deactivated and the surviving members reassigned to other special operations units in the field. However these soldiers often exhibited side effects as a result of their augmentations and many members were discharged from the military as a result of mental instabilities. In order to ensure absolute secrecy, the side effects caused by SPARTAN-I augmentations are masked as a disease known as
   Boren's Syndrome
   — many Orion super-soldiers go on to retire, some eventually have children, but due to their augmentations their children must also be given some form of injections to ensure no defects.

   . Known as the Orion Super-Soldier Weapon System, the plans were not completed until
   Dr. Catherine Halsey
   acquired the plans for her Project: MJOLNIR and brought the suit into existence
   . Parts of the ORION Super-Soldier Weapon System were completed before the end of the program, most notably the forearm and leg armor. The ORION forearm armor was field-tested during Operation: KALEIDOSCOPE

   Mars
   . The chest armor of the ORION Super-Soldier Weapon System incorporated a "Shoulder Angel" micro-missile/decoy launcher on the left shoulder/upper back

    Project Orion
    was also a spacecraft program in the real world. It was the first engineering design study of spacecraft powered by nuclear pulse propulsion. Its supporters felt that it had great potential for space travel, but it lost political approval because of concerns with fallout from its propulsion. The Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963 is generally acknowledged to have ended the project.
