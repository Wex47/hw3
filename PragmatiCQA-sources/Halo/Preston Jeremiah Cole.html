   Preston Jeremiah Cole was born on November 3,
   2470
   , to
   Jennifer Francine Cole
   and
   Troy Henry Cole
   , in the rural reconstituted township of
   Mark Twain
   ,
   Missouri
   .
   He was the third child of
   seven
   (three sisters and three brothers). Growing up he was described as a precocious child who obeyed his parents. He had wild black hair, and dark brown eyes. His father was a dairy farmer with no criminal record, no military background, and followed the Quaker faith with no particular zeal. His mother was arrested once at the age of twenty-one for protesting taxes (she was released on one year parole), and both her grandfathers served in the
   Rainforest Wars
   (one surviving,
   Captain
   Oliver Franks, received the
   Bronze Star
   ).
   Tax records show that despite living in a period of prosperity, Cole's family struggled to make ends meet.

  <p key="a4fe6f29-a948-4228-8bdd-9285f3924177">
   Preston's fifth grade teacher,
   Dr. Lillian Bratton
   , reported Cole as "...a boy of high natural intellect, [who] tends to work too hard even when he plays." She noted his tendency to over-analyze, and stated he had a lack of imagination. That same year he achieved an unprecedented perfect test score in Mr.
   William Martin
   's pre-algebra class. Upon being accused of cheating and retesting, he once again produced a perfect score. A social worker was sent to Cole's home to investigate the school's claims that Preston was being overworked at home, however they found no evidence physical or psychological abuse.
  </p>
  <p key="b212b6ae-98e2-471f-91d4-d98b82582c13">
   When he was fourteen, Cole wrote a paper in English class entitled "The Viability of Extended Colonization." Although it was not particularly well received by his teacher, Miss
   Alexander
   , it turned out to be prophetically accurate in predicting the
   Insurrection
   about a decade before the

   Cole enlisted in the UNSC Navy. Upon graduation from Unified Combined Military Boot Camp (UCMB) Sierra Largo and vacuum and microgravity training (aka "barf school"), Cole was assigned to the

   .

   At OCS he would fall into a scandal involving the overnight disappearances of
   Inna Volkov
   , the daughter of
   Admiral
   Konrad Volkov
   , from officers' family quarters on base. Sightings of the girl in the company of a young man were reported. Soon, a child was produced, presumably by those liaisons. On June 7,
   2492
   six cadets, one of them Cole, were brought before a Board of Inquiry to testify. Though Cole was not found guilty of any wrongdoing, he married Inna two months later. Witnessing the marriage were Admiral Volkov and Michael H. Cole.
   They had a two-week honeymoon, then Cole was reassigned to the

    Historical/Psychological Analysis of Cole, Preston J.

   ,
   Codename: SURGEON
   suggests three reasons why this marriage took place. The first was that the admiral knew which cadet was the true father and didn't like what he saw, and thus found a suitable replacement for his daughter: Cole. A second was that the child was not the offspring of any of the cadets and thus the admiral's grandchild would have been fatherless. The third was that Cole had the liaison with Inna, though was not the father of the child. Either way, Admiral Volkov either made Cole marry his daughter, else Cole was compelled by a sense of chivalry, or (as some of Cole's detractors claimed) a desire for political advancement within the UNSC military by being the son-in-law of an admiral.
  </p>
  <p key="b8f2501a-cb3a-4782-94a0-15bd7b7f4bc2">
   The two remained married and over the next eight years had two more sons and a daughter, which were Cole's biologically. However, as the
   Insurrection
   flared up Cole saw very little of Inna and their children, being engaged on the frontier for months and even years at a time.

   Legion of Honor
   or to have him court martialed. Ultimately they did neither, to avoid setting a difficult precedent. However, from that point on Cole resolved to never again send a distress signal in enemy territory; no one would believe it.

   Inna filed for divorce in

Cole wrote her, accepting responsibility for the failure of their marriage, stating that she never wanted a long-distance military marriage, and though he would always love her, he could not ignore his duty to humanity. He continued to write home to his children, but received no replies, leading him to believe that Inna was burning his letters.

  <p key="2cab1057-dd57-4647-b88f-bff3ceaf868a">
   Cole would spend several years fighting Insurrectionists across the Outer Colonies. He would score victories in nearly all his battles, though he suffered psychological problems due to his divorce.

   When Preston was on leave in November

   . When
   ONI
   found out about Lyra's double-life, his integrity in question, Cole was recalled to Reach for debriefing. Only his fame as a war hero and the efforts of Admiral
   Harold Stanforth
   , a close friend of Cole, kept him from facing a court martial, but not a thorough interrogation by ONI agents.
   Shortly before Cole's debrief, the

   Battle of Theta Ursae Majoris

  </p>
  <p key="79be9cf0-a550-4bd2-825a-1551b4119c64">
   Cole was sent back to Earth to sit at a desk, and was promoted to
   Rear Admiral
   to keep him quiet. All his requests for reassignment back to space were denied, and all of his proposals to make the UNSC fighting forces more effective against the insurgency were ignored. After eight months at his desk job he was quietly offered early retirement with an honorary skip promotion to
   Vice Admiral
   . He accepted.

  <p key="1d8bdafc-57e3-4a0d-bb66-5bd3d500ea51">
   Over the next two decades Cole faded from public view, only resurfacing for his two highly publicized marriages to much-younger women, and their even more spectacularly publicized divorces. During this period he suffered two heart attacks.

   his liver failed from cirrhosis and was subsequently replaced with flash-cloned transplants as were his damaged heart and endocrine system.

Cole ordered all ships fire everything they had at the ship, with MACs first, followed by Archer missiles and Shiva nuclear warheads. This last minute tactical inspiration worked.

   The biggest and most crucial battle in Cole's career was the
   Battle of Psi Serpentis
   ,
   in which Cole led a fleet of one hundred-sixty-two warships against two Covenant fleets totaling over three hundred ships. The engagement began when Cole's fleet,
   Battle Group India
   , exited Slipspace on the far side of the gas giant
   Viperidae
   . The Covenant fleet which had assembled there moved to engage the human ships, but Battle Group India split into two parts and attacked the Covenant from both sides of the planet. After tricking the Covenant into splitting their own forces, Cole's fleet quickly regrouped on one side of Viperidae and opened fire at one group of ships. With two thirds of the Covenant group decimated, the alien fleet regrouped and attacked Cole's fleet.

With only a handful of Covenant ships left, Cole's fleet began to flee the battle. However, another Covenant fleet, numbering in over two hundred ships, then exited Slipspace to reinforce their other fleet. Cole ordered the remnants of Battle Group India to fall back from the planet, leaving Cole's command ship,
