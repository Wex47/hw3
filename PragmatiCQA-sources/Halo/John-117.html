   visited Eridanus II in
   2517
   to study him, they were impressed with his intellect and luck. In a final test of his viability as a candidate, he was asked to determine which side
   an old coin
   would land on. He watched the coin as it flew in the air and caught it before it could land, correctly stating which side was face-up and which was the side of the eagle. John was the first candidate Dr. Halsey and Lieutenant Keyes studied. Later that same year, John and 74 other six-year-old children were "conscripted": they were covertly kidnapped from their homes and replaced with
   flash clones
   , all of which would later die of neurological problems stemming from the imperfect cloning process, covering up the kidnappings. John, along with the other candidates, was taken to the planet of

   When the Spartans were eight years old, they were sent on a training mission in which they were dropped over a forest located deep in one of Reach's snow-filled mountain ranges and expected to get safely to their extraction

   . The children also had instructions to leave the last child arriving behind lest they receive painful punishment; John-117 knew, however, that he could not do that. After telling the Spartans where to meet, the Spartans looked to him as their leader, a role he was initially surprised to receive but eventually accepted. When the group came upon the Pelican, it was guarded by armed men. Those men were actually

   but were not in uniform; the Spartans therefore mistook them for a hostile threat. John showed early acumen in critical thinking and tactics, not wishing to take for granted that guards would be friendly toward them. He came up with a plan to take the men down, capture the dropship, and ensure the safe extraction of every team member, as he made sure he was the last person aboard. To do so he ended up hijacking the dropship with the help of
   Déjà
   and beat down the men with stones, causing severe injuries among the Marines. Chief Mendez was visibly displeased by John's having attacked his Marines and leaving no-one behind, but both Mendez and Halsey recognized John's initiative and promoted him to squad leader. Thereafter, despite other Spartans' rising in rank and at least a couple rising to lead their own teams, he remained the

  <p key="7f7d5eed-76ef-4366-ab4b-2d01b068e042">
   John's leadership skills were correctly observed: the result from their mission clearly solidified his role as the overall leader of the Spartan-IIs. He also became the established leader of the Spartan-II

   At the age of fourteen, John underwent the dangerous
   SPARTAN-II augmentation procedures
   . These procedures killed 30 and physically disabled 12 of the Spartan trainees. John was one of 33 Spartans who survived the process unscathed, while the rest who could still operate were moved to positions in the

   . At only fourteen years old, John was said to have the body of an eighteen-year old Olympic athlete; the augmentation process hastened their reflexes, increased their strength, enhanced their eyesight, and rendered their bones nearly unbreakable. After their augmentation procedures, John and the other Spartans were transferred to the

   Raid on the Third Fleet of Glorious Consequence
   to rescue
   Dr. Catherine Halsey
   . The UNSC deployed a prowler stealth corvette to transport Spartans who would infiltrate the Covenant fleet as it was forced to exit slipspace in order to traverse a stellar magnetic field. The Spartans were given ten minutes to complete the rescue mission or be caught in the annihilation of Third Fleet of Glorious Consequence, likely only possible through the use of a prototype NOVA Bomb. The team infiltrated the fleet with
   OF92/EVA "Booster Frame" fighters
   , which were designed for ship boarding actions. Solomon detected Catherine Halsey's beacon from a Covenant CCS-class Battlecruiser that had its hangar bay shields down. John-117 intuitively voiced his concern about this irregularity but chose to disregard it. Solomon infiltrated the vessel with cover from Kelly and quickly discovered the source: a Covenant antimatter charge.

   Kelly escaped the immediate detonation due to John's warning, but Solomon was vaporized. A further scan resulted in positive readings from all enemy vessels from which John deduced that Catherine was held on the Covenant flagship at the heart of the fleet. The Spartans then successfully fought their way through the Covenant's Seraph formations, and sheared through the massive vessel's hangar bay energy shields with a large barrage of explosive ordnance, gauss cannon rounds, and their own Booster Frame's as projectiles to infiltrate the Covenant

   With three minutes remaining, John and the Spartans sprinted through the collapsed Bubble Shield and down the corridors of the vessel, effortlessly slaughtering Covenant infantry as Frederic-104 breached doorways with a Spartan Laser. Ambushed by Sangheili Energy Swordsmen, Frederic locked the nearest doorway behind John and Kelly to engage them with combat knives alone. The Supreme Commander Luro 'Taralumee initiated a scuttle of the rear of the ship to escape the Spartans. Forced to leap from the section disconnected from the Assault Carrier, Kelly grabbed John's hand and threw him forward using inertia to increase his speed toward the escaping ship but thus threw herself back into space: John reached the ship.

   After rescuing Catherine Halsey from her cryonic stasis pod, John encountered

   Thel 'Lodamee

   Fleetmaster
   separated the lower section of the Assault Carrier to kill the Spartan, thereby pulling Thel back into the upper section; both combatants survived unscathed. John and Halsey descended into the ship and commandeered a weaponless Covenant shuttle craft. A Seraph formation attacked them on exit, but a Seraph commandeered by Fred and Kelly annihilated the enemy fighters and recovered John and Halsey along with fire support from their prowler. John's teammate's deaths deeply saddened him: the operation saw more Spartan-IIs killed in action than any before the Fall of Reach. John vowed to become stronger and never allow such a loss to happen again.

After meeting up with Del Rio, John and Cortana tried to convince the captain of how much a threat the Didact really is, only for their efforts to be in vain as Del Rio was more concerned with having the Infinity escape and send a report back to FLEETCOM. When John attempted to make it a point about the Didact's vulnerability, Del Rio retorted with a veiled insult about John being the final Spartan-II before the bridge.

Del Rio refused to believe it, which angered Cortana, having another fit of rampancy surprising the crew.

Del Rio ordered for the chip to be returned only to be turned down by John, angered even further Del Rio ordered for John to be arrested at the hands of Palmer. John gave a final warning of the Didact, and left the bridge.
   Lasky decided to circumvent orders and instead give John a Pelican to help in his efforts to defeat the Didact. John left the Infinity and went to disable two towers that were generating a shield around the Didact, later attempting to use a control tower to trap the Didact inside Requiem.

   UNSC research facility
   fell under attack by the forces from Requiem. John-117 managed to enter the Lich,incapacitate the Covenant crew and take over the bridge, sending a broadcast to the station and warning them of the impending attack, telling them to start an immediate evacuation. In the middle of the message Cortana's rampancy stopped John-117's broadcast with another outburst. She ignored his command to stop the Lich from a crash course with the station and continued to ramble, causing the captured vehicle to crash into the station.
  </p>
  <p key="b97eecca-813d-488f-b9ae-a95e7588ca35">
   After waking up in the remains of the crash, John-117 regained communications with the station's head scientist,
   Dr. Tillson
   . He recommended for her to evacuate the station. Replying that the Covenant had taken over the landing bays, John-117 then told her to at least prepare for evacuation while he secured one. He fought his way through the station, defeating multiple Jul 'Mdama's Covenant squads until he eventually had cleared an evacuation point. From there he made his way to Dr. Tillson to explain the situation of the Didact's yearning for the Composer on the station. As the Composer was too large to move with anything less powerful than the biggest star ship in the UNSC, The Spartan asked for Dr. Tillson to give Cortana access to the station's supply manifest in order to search for a means of destroying the Composer.

  <p key="0a6d2489-9339-4f79-9498-1dc0c061814f">
   Cortana managed to find a nuclear warhead on the station, and the Master Chief decided that it was the only way the Didact could possibly be stopped from taking the Composer. Telling Tillson this caused her great distress, as she had dedicated herself to researching the Composer for a very long time. However, she still gave the Spartan her word that she would make sure the warheads were primed for a remote detonation. Apologizing, John once again asked for Tillson to begin the evacuation.
  </p>
  <p key="13bd13bf-da0f-493b-a013-4e7ffccd69a8">
   When Tillson began this evacuation, the first evacuation shuttle was shot down by the Covenant. Cortana realized that she and John would be able to program the station's defenses to provide cover for the evacuation. Fighting his way to the defense console, Cortana's rampant outbursts continued to worsen. While Tillson's team rigged the warhead, Cortana programmed the defenses, succeeding to make them target the Covenant. The Spartan then went to rendezvous with Dr. Tillson, but was hindered by the Composer's location being compromised. Fending enemies off once more, the Chief told Dr. Tillson that, ready or not, he needed the weapon then. On his next broadcast to her, he received no response, and so headed back to the elevator platform to get to a cargo bay, hopefully to find the nuke and Dr. Tillson. An immense energy wave hit the elevator in mid-transport, stopping it.

The elevator continued on its course and John-117 exited it to find Tillson and a large crowd of distressed scientists. Telling her that the Didact stole the Composer, he inserted Cortana into the system and asked to check the flight catalog for anything that can carry a payload. Tillson in confusion asks the Chief how the Didact moved the Composer, then, trembling, told him "Wait... something is happening" as the Didact charged a beam. He asked Cortana to activate the station's defenses, but they did not respond. Cortana continued to search through the catalog but found nothing. Unable to help, Cortana watched as the Composer composed every member of the science team at once, only knocking John unconscious because of his immunity to the weapon.

   An unspecified amount of time passed before John-117 awakened and saw Cortana, distraught, sitting at the console. She asked him if he was okay and, crying, said she could hear what was left of the scientists after monitoring the data pulse. The Spartan clearly attempted to avoid emotional conversation, and stoically stated that they needed to move. Cortana sadly said that the scientists were gone, to which John dutifully added that more would follow if the Didact reached Earth. Cortana returned to dwell on her ensuing rampancy and how the UNSC would pair John with another AI, possibly another Cortana model if Halsey let them. He told her that he wouldn't let that happen. She ignored his stubborn optimism and desperately informed him that the new AI wouldn't be her. Beginning to power up a
   Broadsword
   in the hangar, the AI let the Master Chief know that whatever the Librarian did to John-117 worked.

  <p key="2f908f94-8839-4648-a500-91fcce1fa5be">
   John-117 made his way to the hangar, entering the pilot seat of the Broadsword, which was being armed with the warhead. He then set off from Ivanoff Station in pursuit of the Didact. Cortana stated a plan of boarding the ship and finding the bridge when the Didact began to prepare for another slipspace jump. She warned him that the Broadsword's shields were not rated for slipspace, but John replied that the Didact's were, before boosting forward to take refuge inside his enemy's shielding. The Spartan then started to fly along the outer hull of the Didact's ship, toward the Composer, dodging pieces of the ship as they moved and activated defenses attempting to destroy him.

   During this time, the Didact broadcasted a signal, expressing his surprise and dismay at how John-117 wasn't composed and that such inoculation should not have been possible. Cortana explained that the Didact was with the Composer and that they could destroy both of them at once. John continued to fly through the outer hull of the ship until Cortana told him that they were coming out of slipspace. Communications from Earth warned them of the fleet's detection of the unknown ship. Master Chief then attempted to contact Captain Del Rio on the

John questioned him as to where the captain was, with Lasky replying that FLEETCOM wasn't happy with Del Rio abandoning the Chief on Requiem, and that he himself would have to do instead. John explained the Didact's intentions and that he and Cortana were in a Broadsword carrying a HAVOC grade payload, with the intention of destroying the Composer. Lasky had the orbiting fleet engage the Didact and the Composer.

   The Spartan managed to fight through the remainder of the outer hull and located the Composer and the Didact. Attempting to gain access to the Composer, Master Chief was cut off from an opening to it. John informed Lasky of this, to which he recommended deactivating the shields so Infinity could make another opening. John-117 proceeded to destroy the shield and weapon generators.

   John entered the ship, and, in an attempt to stop him, the Didact caused the pathway to close down on the Broadsword. John expertly maneuvered his fighter through the compressing pathway until it shrank to a narrow strip of white light, making the Broadsword crash. He stepped away from the destroyed hull of his Broadsword, somehow seemingly unscathed, Cortana queried John as to what his next move was. He procured the nuclear warhead and magnetically locked it to his armor, designating it as "Plan B." From there he fought his way through waves of Promethean resistance leading to the Didact. Eventually the duo reached the central control area of the Composer. The Chief then used a gravity lift to thrust himself across a void, reaching the lower floors of the control center. John accessed a terminal to try to allow Cortana to deactivate the shield the Didact deployed to protect the Composer. Cortana told him to insert her into a few terminals around the Composer so that she may deactivate the shielding around it. After fighting his way to the first generator Cortana revealed that she was going to do something that he was not going to like. Her holographic form tore into multiple copies as she ejected her rampant personality spikes into the system, in order to overwhelm and disable the shielding under the stress of the sheer amount of multiplying rampant copies. Repeating this process, John-117 moved to engage the Didact, who declared that he (John) had failed, firing the Composer onto Earth and Composing the population of New Phoenix. John went to retrieve Cortana but the Didact disintegrated the terminal, launching a desperate John backwards.

   Locating a gravity lift, the Spartan was elevated to a light bridge directly connected to the Composer. He caught sight of the Didact within the orange aura above the Composer, but his enemy quickly vanished, sensing his presence. Vocally challenging John, the Forerunner claimed that the man had persisted too long offering him the opportunity to have his "resolution." John turned with a jolt to notice the Didact behind him and attempted to engage him, before being thrown back by his Forerunner enemy, having the warhead knocked away from him and sliding across the light bridge and his Battle Rifle pushed into the abyss below.

  <p key="df80c6f2-f6de-4716-9ef6-952d8897fc72">
   Regaining his footing, John-117 became torn between his options of charging the Didact or retrieving the warhead. He ran for the warhead but was stopped by the Didact who lifted and held him over the slipspace portal that was powering the Composer, claiming John was misguided and that humanity's imprisonment in the Composer would be a kindness. The Didact began to close his fist, exerting a crushing force on John and causing him to groan in what would be extreme pain even for a Spartan-II.

   Before he could drop John into the abyss, the Didact was surrounded by Cortana's rampant personality spikes who emerge from the light bridge. After a short confrontation with the Didact, Cortana attacked the Didact and bound him by the arms to the bridge by using her hardlight forms. John-117 was released and crashed chest-first onto the edge of the light bridge, barely able to grab onto the ledge, with the swirling orange abyss beneath him. He climbed up the bridge and swiftly charged the Didact, plunging a Pulse Grenade into his armor. The Didact, however, broke free from Cortana's bonds and pushed him away, sending him sliding across the bridge. Freeing his other arm, the Didact began to slowly lift John into the air, with the Spartan exerting sounds of desperation and pain, preparing for an almost imminent demise. The grenade detonated, causing the Didact to lose focus, become seriously injured and drop John, stumbling off the bridge into the slipspace rupture below.
Out of time, John painfully crawled towards the warhead, frequently crashing onto the light bridge. He prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Taking one final look up at Earth, John yelled in defiance to his enemy and smashed his hand on the tip of the warhead, detonating the nuclear weapon.

Stubbornly refusing to believe this, the Spartan ordered that they go together, and, with his voice quivering, told her, "I am

   infiltrators but ten of Sekibo's security detail were killed, along with three Sangheili guards. By the time investigators realized that the attack was the work of Sapien Sunrise, a leak had revealed false information regarding the events to the UEG public, causing outcry against the Master Chief and the SPARTAN-II Program in general.
   One of the last missions John would participate in for the UNSC is the
   raid of the UNSC Argent Moon

   Jul 'Mdama's Covenant has taken the Argent Moon and Blue Team was dispatched to retake the ship. Although fighting the Covenant isn't abnormal, John's own team has been running on continuous missions and there's been genuine concern amongst the Spartans about him. However, John insists he's okay and lead the team into the Argent Moon. It was while fighting a Hunter that John got separated from his team, falling into the lower decks of the ship. During that time, he had a vision of Cortana within a cave and saw Cortana. The A.I. talked about reclamation starting soon and the planet Meridian. When John came to his senses, Blue Team regrouped with him to retake the ship. Unfortunately, more Covenant forces arrived and John decided to scuttle the ship. It was between this time that

   Blue Team set the ship's reactor core to a time-controlled detonation and reported to the Infinity that he intends to head to Merdian to investigate a lead about Cortana. To everyone's surprise, Infinity replied that another team will handle the matter and wants Blue Team to return. Finding the whole matter suspicious, John disobeyed his return order and decided to proceed heading to Meridian. John planned to do this himself without getting the rest of his team involved, but their loyalties to John motivated the rest of Blue Team to join him. The team boarded a Winter-class Prowler and left as Argent Moon exploded. The ship cloaked and headed to Meridian. Some time later, John had gone missing and was considered to have gone AWOL.

   The personality of John is explored much more deeply in the books than the games. This is in order that players can more easily project their own personalities onto John-117.
  </p>
  <p key="dabb6451-fedf-4e47-83a6-03e50bd2403e">
   As a child, John strove to win at any situation, at all costs. This seems to have been a part of his character even prior to his conscription to the SPARTAN Program, as he pushed himself to win at any game he played, including chess,
   gravball
   or King of the Hill.
   As his career progressed, he transformed his desire to achieve personal victory to a desire to achieve victory for his squad and, by extension, humanity as a whole. John is tenacious to complete any mission at hand, and often disregards his personal safety in order to win. Indeed, he has often emerged victorious from situations many would consider impossible. Though even a Spartan is not devoid of fear, John simply acknowledges it and puts it aside, while never openly showing it.
   He is not shy about expressing caution, however, as shown in his first encounter with the Gravemind. John is generally stoic and taciturn, but not devoid of a sense of humor. He often makes dry remarks about the situation at hand, but this seems to be more frequent when interacting with Cortana than anyone else, such as other Spartans.

  <p key="d47f988d-4ae7-4872-980e-22db8fdb68a0">
   John is also known as a man of his word and will strive to keep any promise he makes, even at great personal risk. As he was forced to leave Cortana behind on

   to retrieve her. Upon finding her, Cortana was in a weak and damaged state. Nearing rampancy, John-117 told her, "You know me. When I make a promise…" to which Cortana replied "You keep it." This encouragement gave her the strength to compose herself after enduring the mental tortures of the Gravemind. John holds great personal respect for his trainer and mentor Chief Petty Officer Mendez, as well as Dr. Halsey, who he considers a mother-like figure. He appears to deny Halsey's claims about his extraordinary luck at several points in the

   In a strange twist of fate, one of John's closests friendships was with the construct Cortana, an artificial intelligence "born" from the mind of Dr. Halsey herself. Cortana was initially assigned to him for his mission to capture the Covenant Prophets. Despite some initial hesitation towards working with an AI out of fear of conflicting directives, John and Cortana quickly formed a formidable team and John realized quickly that Cortana would be a great help instead of a liability. The two's relationship evolved from a partnership to a close friendship over the course of
   <i key="13d333cb-0e7f-4452-a099-6148ab43db3e">

   , due both the duration of the mission and the life-or-death situations they struggled through. During their adventures, John showed absolute trust in Cortana, believing in her even when Lord Hood was unsure of her reliability, being willing to trust her enough to risk Earth on her word that she had a way to stop the Flood. The two also had similar personalities: they both had a propensity to blow things up, with John commenting he wasn't sure which one of them was better at it. The pair also tended to enjoy executing high risk plans. After Cortana explained to John his strategy to use a disabled bomb to blow up a Covenant Carrier was crazy, he offered to leave her behind. Instead, she quipped, "Unfortunately for us both, I

  <p key="1d33e270-36ed-439d-a241-57aead047e45">
   Although John has difficulty understanding the 'undisciplined' lifestyle of civilians, he is fiercely protective of their lives and humanity as a whole. The mass slaughter of civilians at the hands of the Covenant was enough to drive even the stoic John into a cold rage. After the massacre of Draco III, John and his Spartans remained on-site until every Covenant soldier responsible for the atrocity was dead.

   John is known to show an exceptional care for soldiers under his command, while at times viewing them as a liability rather than an asset (more out of fear and concern for them than for himself). By 2552, after his experiences on Halo, John acknowledged to Corporal Locklear that, armor and enhancements aside, there was little difference between a 'normal' soldier and himself. This is not to say that John was previously without compassion. During the Battle of Installation 04, when searching for the survivors of the

   , a Marine named Fitzgerald was wounded by an Unggoy with a Needler. John-117 retrieved a first aid kit and expertly treated the wound, taking time to ask the Marine if he was alright. By 2552, most members of the UNSC held "John-117" in complete awe, even among his Spartan comrades. His exploits and prowess quickly made him a legend in his own time, and his mere presence on a battlefield was enough to inspire the hope of victory regardless of the odds.

   during Operation: FIRST STRIKE, Dr. Halsey decided to test his morality by giving him two data chips, one containing information regarding Avery Johnson's immunity to the Flood, which would surely lead to his dissection by ONI with little chance of replicating his immunity. The other was missing this data, and John originally planned to sacrifice his friend in accordance with directive, but realized that one man

   , after Cortana's rampant outburst surprising everyone in the room, Captain Andrew Del Rio acted on his resentment of John-117 for questioning his orders to flee Requiem and subsequently ordered that Cortana be destroyed. Before Commander Lasky could retrieve her, without hesitation John did so first, displaying his unflinching loyalty to Cortana, and that not even the UNSC would stop him from doing everything in his power to save her. Del Rio personally ordered John to hand her over, but he refused, responding, "no, sir." After the infuriated Captain ordered his arrest, Commander Sarah Palmer refused to act, and John-117 promptly left

   John's age is affected by the same ambiguities as all beings who undergo extended voyages through space. By technical human Earth years, John is approximately 46 years old in 2557; this provides an upper limit of sorts - he is no older than 46. However, during the 27 Earth years that he has spent fighting the Covenant, considerable time was spent in slipspace. He also spent four years, seven months, and ten days in cryonic stasis stranded aboard the UNSC
   <i key="86b5c926-112b-4a0f-9c60-301125b521b1">
    Forward Unto Dawn
   </i>
   from 2552 to 2557. The aging process is slowed in slipspace by
   cryonic stasis chambers
   ; in which cellular aging can be halted almost completely. Also, one could expect that individuals participating in slipspace travel might be subject to the time dilation associated with travel at relativistic speeds, so there could be more discrepancy involved there as well. It should also be noted that while no direct correlation can be made between his age and the events on Requiem, there exists the possibility that when the Librarian altered John's evolutionary process, it may have affected the aging process as well as a number of other physiological functions within him. All these factors contribute to a very mixed and inaccurate estimation of his age.

It is also worth noting that on the periodic table of elements, element 117 is an artificially created halogen (note the "halo" prefix" and being "man made").
