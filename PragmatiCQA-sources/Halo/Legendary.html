   It is regarded as a large challenge even for veteran players. Allies are practically useless aside from creating distractions. Overwhelming enemy firepower and superior numbers are plentiful on Legendary, while AI enemies have greater intelligence.     
One must play cautiously and conservatively to succeed. Enemies are extremely strong while you and your allies' strength is extremely low in comparison, often leading the player to die frequently. Legendary on

   In the first Halo game, the differences between Legendary and other settings is relatively numeric. The player does not face unique or different enemies but they do encounter many more enemies who are tougher to defeat and endure. Many of the same strategies that work on other settings generally function on Legendary in this game except that the player has to be more careful of one's own weaknesses than before. This is where the

   combo really comes in handy. This game is arguably one of the hardest of the series since health packs are relatively scarce and shield regeneration is fairly slow, so the player must proceed with extreme caution, since medikits tend to be spread out.
