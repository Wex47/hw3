   . According to the Covenant religion, the Forerunners, being nearly omniscient and all-powerful beings, discovered a method to transcend the physical world and achieve divinity. They were believed to have accomplished this through the construction and activation of seven monolithic installations referred to as the
   Halos
   . Though these installations were also referred to colloquially by the Covenant as the "sacred rings." According to the Covenant belief, upon activation the Halos initiated a sublimination event known as "the great journey" propelling the Forerunners into a state of transcendence. However, all lesser species were inherently unworthy of this journey and were left behind. The Covenant Empire, or at least their leadership caste -the

   </a>
   , believe themselves to be the chosen inheritors of the Forerunners divine technology. The foundation of the Covenant Empire is built upon the desire to reclaim lost Forerunner technology and use these gifts of divinity they left behind in the physical world. Their ultimate purpose, however, is to locate and activate the Halo Installations. In doing so, they believe that all faithful adherents to the Covenant Religion will be allowed to transcend the limitations of the physical world and walk among the Forerunners as divine beings. All client races of the Covenant Empire follow the San'Shyuum prophets in the hopes of also ascending into godhood.

   A small unit attached to the Fleet of Particular Justice deployed during the Battle of Installation 04 was searching for relics on a gas mine orbiting
   Threshold
   and happened to come into contact with what they labeled an "oracle" of their faith, the monitor for the Halo installation in the system that escaped its destruction. This unit was led by the
   Sesa 'Refumee
   , who discovered the true purpose of the Halo Array from this "oracle,"
   343 Guilty Spark

Rather than taking the Covenant on a path to divinity, activating the rings would mean the destruction of all sentient life within three radii of the galactic center. 'Refumee convinced the others to renounce their religion, thus beginning the
   Heretic
   movement, and began openly preaching the truth about Halo to the rest of the Covenant. In response to this, the High Prophets sent a group of
   Special Operations Sangheili

   Following the Great Schism and the death of The Prophet of Truth, the Covenant Loyalist Empire effectively dissolved. For more than six years, the member species of the Covenant fought a brutal civil war. Immediately following Truth's death, the San'Shyuum sought to save themselves from the rage of the Sangheili, and so provided the Jiralhanae with new weapons, ships and other tools to aid in their protection. During this period the Prophets, who already had been few in number, largely disappeared, leading to rumours that they had actually finally achieved the Great Journey.

  <p key="0682a831-7526-479d-9437-25f83c8c278b">
   Even among the Covenant Separatists their ancient religion continued to survive and was not completely abandoned. As one
   Sangheili Shipmaster
   believed, "he knew his gods were out there, but he had no idea what they wanted."
   The species of the Covenant had always relied on the Prophets to lead them in spiritual matters. The devout Sangheili in particular had not had any need for their own religious leaders for centuries, and now found that no one among them had the knowledge or the ability to comprehend the will of the gods. For a people whose sole purpose had been enforcing their gods' will, this was terrifying. One faction,
   <a href="Jul 'Mdama's Covenant.html" key="f10790a3-d136-45e5-b138-69e36fe9922a" title="Jul 'Mdama's Covenant">

   Decimus

   The Banished
   also still held to their beliefs.

  <p key="dc9da4b3-3358-40ca-bfc6-d4a35f94d9c2">
   This period can perhaps be understood as somewhat being akin the
   Protestant Reformation
   in Western Christianity. A loss of faith in a society's religious leaders did not lead to a complete abandonment of said religion's deities. Rather it led to a period of intense conflict as various factions began to develop their own new interpretations of ancient beliefs. Although the Sangheili no longer believed in the Prophets as the messengers of the gods or in the Great Journey as they had described it, many still believed in their gods.

This included nearly all of the Forerunners, who had left behind an array of automated mechanisms to return the indexed life forms to their homeworlds.

   , were initially created by the Forerunners to maintain their dormant installations. They have no interest in religion or faith, rarely deviating their focus from the technology of which they are responsible for. Even prior to the Great Schism, Huragok generally seem to remain neutral in any conflict, but appear to prefer assisting those oppressed or harmed by the Covenant Empire. Just prior to the First Battle of Harvest after first-contact with humanity, one went as far as to create a gift symbolizing peace for the humans (a vehicle design which would ironically be used by the Jiralhanae as a deadly weapon to kill them for decades to come) and then later assisted the humans in their escape. Yet another Huragok repaired

   engines and even repaired a Needler in combat for John-117 to use in battle against the Covenant while another repaired his damaged shielding system. They are revealed to possess morality and generally resent their oppression by the Covenant, repairing their technology thus ensuring their technological stability and superiority against other species who also suffer at the hands of the Covenant's wrath.

   seem to feel no compulsion for religion in their societies, but continued to follow the San'Shyuum out of fear of punishment or loyalty. As a result of their hive-minded lifestyle, the Yanme'e obeyed their Prophets without thought or question. Individual beliefs may have played a part in the Lekgolo's decision, but they may have sided with the Loyalists for the same reason as the Kig-Yar. At least some of the Lekgolo sided with the Sangheili in their opposition, however.
