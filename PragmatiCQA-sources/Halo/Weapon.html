   An extensive array of weapons is available within the gameplay, with each weapon operating differently. This allows players to take a different approach and sometimes forces a change inÂ tactics depending on the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon. Each player will also find a weapon to suit his or her tastes, in terms of power, speed, range, kickback and/or feedback. For example, a player who is suited with sniping might have the
   Sniper rifle
   ,
   Beam Rifle
   ,
   DMR

   Battle rifle

   refined many weapons for both Human and Covenant sides, weapons systems were streamlined and most human weapons in particular were designed to fit combat at a certain range which defined their role. Reach drifted away from the dual wielding system. Reach also introduced three new weapon mechanics, first is reticle bloom; a part of the weapon's crosshair that indicates how accurate or inaccurate a weapon will be depending on the rate of fire. With the semi-auto weapons the faster the trigger is pulled, the less accurate it would become. With full auto weapons the longer the trigger is held down the less accurate the shot pattern will be, short controlled burst can be used to retain accuracy beyond the weapons effective range. The second weapon mechanic introduced was turret overheating, most turrets with unlimited ammo like the
   machine gun turret
   and the
   <a href="M41 Light Anti-Aircraft Gun.html" key="a68c0efd-c091-4e00-b7e6-eeac386989a7" title="M41 Light Anti-Aircraft Gun">
    Warthog turret
   </a>
   will over heat after prolonged periods of continuous fire; when a turret overheats it will become inoperative for a short time in order to cool down much like many plasma weapons, this makes firing in accurate bursts important. The final change is the inclusion of
   assassinations
   , where an extended attack animation is activated when the player holds down the melee attack button while approaching from behind. Furthermore, Reach introduced a new factor to battles. While equipment from Halo 3 was removed, it was replaced by
   Armor Abilities
   . These abilities offered active actions to the Spartan, some of which were similar to equipment (
   Active Camouflage
   , Drop Shield etc.), and some that are entirely new (Sprint,
   Armor Lock
   ,
   Jetpack
   etc.) Â As far as weapon selection goes, Reach is fairly similar to

   . The addition of the Forerunner race included a new set of advanced weapon systems specially designed for combating the Flood. These weapons are all hard-light based and some disintegrate the opponents when killed with them, making them impossible to be taken over by the Flood. Halo 4 also introduces
   Tactical Packages
   &amp;
   Support Packages
   that offer passive abilities to a Spartan whether by altering a Spartan's general performance (quicker movement, silent steps etc.) or by altering the performance of a weapon (Reload Speeds, increased ammo capacity etc.). Halo 4 advanced the use of Sprinting from an active armor ability, to a general trait to all Spartans.

    Simply running towards your enemy and shooting at the same time is not a good tactic. Strafing is a better alternative.
