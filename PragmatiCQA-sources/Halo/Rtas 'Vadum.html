   Rtas 'Vadum was born on September 21, 2487 on
   Sanghelios
   . He grew up on a keep close to the ocean. As a child, 'Vadum would often explore the shoreline and catch sea urchins and other creatures. One day, the tide went lower than usual and this allowed 'Vadum to venture out further and catch rare sea creatures. This, however, had been the onset of an incoming tsunami and 'Vadum was forced to run a kilometer back to the shore to escape the wave, sustaining injuries from the sea urchins and the limestone he stepped on while running. 'Vadum went on to graduate with honors from a top military college and joined the
