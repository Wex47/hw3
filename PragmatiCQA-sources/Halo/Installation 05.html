   About 200 years prior to 2552, the Flood on Installation 05 escaped and evaded containment due to negligence on the part of the installation's Monitor, Penitent Tangent.
   The Flood quickly grew out of control around the area of the Installation's Library. The Flood were kept contained by a
   Sentinel Wall
   built around the Library, but

   The Arbiter was then saved by the Gravemind from death and brought to a chamber where the Gravemind rests.

   made a slipspace jump inside the Covenant holy city and crashed into one of the Covenant structures. It was apparent that the Flood had successfully penetrated the Covenant's defenses and managed to spread its infection throughout the whole city. Fighting his way through the Flood and Covenant forces, John-117 found himself unsuccessful in retrieving the Index. The Jiralhanae Chieftain Tartarus and the High Prophet of Truth, along with Miranda Keyes and Johnson held captive, left the site while leaving the High Prophet of Mercy being infected slowly by an Infection form. Cortana instructed John-117 to hunt down the Prophet of Truth while she begins the detonation of

   At the same time, the Arbiter managed to gather enough Sangheili and Unggoy support to engage the Jiralhanae and the Kig-yar. He met Rtas 'Vadum once again on a cliff overlooking the Control Center, with Tartarus arriving shortly at the entrance of the Control Center. The Arbiter, assisted by Rtas 'Vadum, rallied more Sangheili and Unggoy to support their operation to take over and commandeer a Scarab. The Arbiter 'rescued' Johnson from his captors and agreed to escort him in a Banshee to the Control Center. Johnson, piloting the Scarab, destroyed the entrance of the Control Center, allowing the Arbiter to enter the structure.

   At the same time, John-117 was sent into the Forerunner Dreadnought to follow the Prophet of Truth by Cortana using the power conduit. Cortana left behind, faced Gravemind who had gained complete control over High Charity. Meanwhile, in space over the Installation, the

   commanded by Sangheili and Jiralhanae shipmasters engaged one another as a result of the expanded Civil War of the Covenant.

The firing sequence was put on standby mode, ready for remote activation through

   The architecture of structures on Installation 05 follows the general Forerunner aesthetic (i.e. angular design, and same basic functional structures), but has a clearly distinct style from some other installations such as

   or
   04
   , an example being Installation 05's Control Room having similarity to Installation 04's Control Room in purpose, but with a different look, including a spherical shape at the center of the building. This is different from both versions of Installation 04, which look almost exactly the same (being of the same style) and have the same surroundings. In addition, many structures on Installation 05 including the
   Temple
   appear to be more weathered than those on other installations, having a slightly brown-tinted gray color.

  <p key="b65ad09c-b10d-4333-8e6f-35aec589b13b">
   A curious feature on Installation 05 is some of its ruins. While visibly consistent with Forerunner architecture, the ruins seem clearly older and more primitive than most Forerunner structures. They are also made of stone, as opposed to the metallic material seen on the majority of Forerunner constructs. This brings up the question of whether these are Forerunner structures at all, or if they were built by an even more ancient civilization or the Forerunners themselves long time before the construction of the Halo installations, and later moved to the ring for unknown reasons.
   Still, only a fraction of the installation's structures represent the older variety, as most of them are in a similar condition as on other known installations. It has also been suggested that some of the newer structures were built around the older ones to support and protect them.

    When the control room of Installation 05 shoots a bolt of energy into the ball of energy at the center of halo, the bolt fired by the control room is visible, even though Halo is 10,000 km in diameter. As the control room is only a few km wide at most, the bolt was probably shown to be much bigger to be actually visible during the halting of the firing of halo, but a more likely answer to this is that the shot fired from the control room last, was charging in mid-air.
