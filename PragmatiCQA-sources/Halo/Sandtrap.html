   structures. They may have been built merely as temporary shelters or possibly bunkers. They could also be ancient Forerunner structures (similar to human castles in our time), making it an archeological site (explaining the "modern" towers surrounding the site). Another possibility is that these structures were built by the
   Precursors
   before the Forerunner's rise to power. The origin of these structures is unknown, but they bear certain similarities to the "temples" on

For example, if you are inside of the crashed Phantom, it will be hard for other players to see you and the location gives you a very interesting view to take down some unsuspecting players.

   According to the holographic displays stationed on the lower sections of both Elephants, Sandtrap has an atmosphere which is mainly composed of CO

This may mean that Sandtrap is not located on the Ark, or that it is located on a previously unseen section of the Ark with wholly different atmospheric characteristics. Simple equipment malfunction is another possibility, as the artificial nature of the Ark may well play havoc with instruments designed for use on conventional worlds.

    The two wind tunnels or air lifts are powered by a green square object. There are only two of these objects hidden underneath each of the tunnels or lifts. To see them, you must get under the map in

    The playable size of Sandtrap can be doubled by going outside of the map, where there is more playing space. The explosions of the mines can simply be countered in
    Forge
    by placing large piles of every possible type of grenades. These grenades will negate all explosions even though it seems like the explosions are still happening. However, this will only work in Forge and not Custom Games. The reason why is currently unknown.

    In Multi-Flag
    CTF
    and
    Assault
    , a good strategy is to seize the enemy Elephant and bring it to your base in order to repeatedly capture the objective. In Neutral Assault, take the enemy Elephant to the very middle of the map and continuously grab and plant the bomb until victory. Beware; stealing an enemy Elephant is quite a task, so make sure to bring several team-mates along with you.

    On several dunes to the side of the map where the sun is, you can easily see the whole area of the map. Set up here and you can dominate. A common tactic is to take the sniper and use a
    Mongoose
    to drive over to the area and snipe. Good secondary weapons are
    Assault Rifles
    to dispatch enemies that attack you at close range and
    Spartan Lasers
    so any incoming vehicles can be eliminated, and the sniper can continue wreaking havoc from afar.

    In CTF games, try to sneak up on the flag with a partner. Take the flag from the Elephant and steal the enemy's Mongoose that spawns on the Elephant's lower level. Your opponents will think that when you steal a flag, you will be easy to kill. But you will be long gone by then.

   <li key="bce3cdac-37dd-480e-ae7f-60ac2558cae1">
    If you start at the Albatross end of the map, and if you are going for the Sniper Rifle, then always keep an eye out for enemies camping up high on the other side, although a
    Bubble Shield
    is an easy way to get past this problem.

    If you are driving a Warthog, stick to the other Warthog until most threats are eliminated. That way, at least one of you can kill the enemy. It also ensures a victory over a lone enemy Warthog or Brute Chopper, provided that both gunners are paying attention to it.

    One great sniper spot is inside the crashed

   <li key="300684bb-89cc-4339-822e-98008639f461">
    Another excellent sniper spot is the highest sand dune on the outer edge of the map. This area provides a spot where you can see the whole map. However, there is no cover and you can be easily detected. Also, it is usually the first guess as to where a sniper is hiding, due to the relative popularity of the spot.

    Have your VIP jump on top of your Banshee, then gently ease up to the large towers. By crouching and on the far side of the map, it is difficult for enemies to kill the VIP.

    When playing
    Slayer
    gametypes, the Warthog is undoubtedly one of the most important things to get kills with. Have a driver drive the gunner along the paths of the map and eliminate any foot soldiers. Beware of the Chopper, Spartan Laser, and other Warthogs, as they are the biggest threat to your Warthog.
   </li>
   <li key="8a8d96bf-2e8a-4812-a20d-b727785f3b33">
    The Mongoose is a great vehicle for getting to the combat zone fast. Coupled with a passenger on the back and the ability to drive in the mine field, it can be a fast moving offensive weapon.

    On Sandtrap, heavy tanks are strong weapons and should be used. Tanks will usually survive a Spartan Laser hit so you are relatively safe inside. Just keep driving around the bases, and do not go into the middle of the map because A: Mines are usually planted there and B: Enemies could jump on the tank and easily hijack it or plant grenades on it.

   <li key="52faf74c-8234-4561-ad44-2e33556c8b75">
    An effective position for enemy snipers is at the top of the tall towers (Phantom End). They get there by ditching a Banshee aircraft just above the tower tops, landing safely on top. The enemy will have prepared by gathering weapons and equipment such as Bubble Shields, Flares, Spartan Lasers, and of course the Sniper Rifle. There is a 360 degree view of Sandtrap from the top of the towers and ground forces often won't be looking up. A good way to determine whether there is an enemy situated at the top of the towers is to look for an abandoned Banshee near the Elephant or in the vicinity of the towers. A wise enemy will, however, always destroy the Banshee once it has done it's job.

   <li key="35503038-26bc-4d75-83f6-0ac330187916">

    During Assault, take the guy with the bomb on the back of a Mongoose with a Warthog following you. Drive to the outer edge (the minefield) of the map and circle back to the opponent's base. Most people don't expect a surprise attack from the outskirts of Sandtrap.

    There are two ways to "bridge the gap" between the big wall in the center. The first is a simple two-way teleport system, obviously both being on the same channel. This allows for infantry to cross; however vehicles can't go through Teleporters. The way to fix that is to place two permanent

    . Be cautious going towards the smaller base (with the
    Albatross
    ), as you may go through the holes in the top, and flip your vehicle over.
   </li>
   <li key="ee6db201-fd99-4d90-8e6a-79b142cf1696">
    Another fun way to "bridge the gap" is to use the
    Floating Forge Items
    trick on Crates. This also gives you the opportunity to make a new focus point for some of the attention if it is a
    Flag
    ,  or
    Oddball
    , spawn point.
   </li>
   <li key="4fe262ae-587f-4c41-ba59-a966307744ed">
    Similarly, Crates, Radio Antennae, and similar objects are useful when constructing floating bases using the Floating Forge Items glitch.

    The map is obviously based on vehicular combat, so consider that when in Forge. Place vehicles like

    Two-Way Node
    from the top of the pillars to the bottoms.
   </li>
   <li key="92ecdeb0-716c-4795-8934-87795322d1a6">
    It is possible to make the Elephant fly while in Forge. Place all the map's explosives (Fusion Coils and
    Plasma Batteries
    ) in the Elephant and set the run time minimum to the highest number. Then, spawn a Hornet. Get into the Hornet and fire missiles at the explosives. The Elephant will do flips and get off the ground. It causes lots of lag and noise, but it is still fun to watch.
   </li>
   <li key="2b449d4b-771c-47d5-bc40-e9dd898a909d">
    There is a way to indirectly pick up the Elephant in Forge, though it will not spawn where you place it. Spawn a Scorpion tank and slip it inside horizontally from behind the Elephant. You will see hook-like attachments on top of the Elephant. Slip the scorpion under that and lift. It will rise a little, but the tank will slip out from under it eventually.
   </li>
   <li key="2a84cff4-3f93-46e0-85f5-e7a2faa3957b">
    Another way to pick up the Elephant is to spawn a closed Drop Pod and move it into the cockpit. Then, you just move the Drop Pod and the Elephant will come too.

    Near the top of one of the temples there is an apparent "Black Hole" that absorbs any explosive attack. For example, if you shoot a rocket into it, it will go through the "Black Hole" and not explode. If the "Black hole" is looked through at a certain angle in Forge mode, the player can see what one of the opposing players sees, similar to the blue room in Avalanche and the freezer room on Longshore (the black hole was thought to be a glitch by most players).
