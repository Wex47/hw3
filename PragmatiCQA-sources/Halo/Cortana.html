   Learning of Cortana's plans, John-117 accepted that she had to be stopped, but hoped that he could be able to reason with her. Cortana was irritated by the Warden's constant attempts to harm John, eventually banishing him temporarily as a result of his actions. She then manifested herself to see John once more, who tried to convince her to stop. Cortana was disappointed, but simply believing him to be misguided, decided to lock him and Blue Team in the

   Cortana had a witty and playful personality and a small sense of cryptic humor laced with some sarcasm. She had neither arrogance nor false modesty about her immense capabilities, and her statements about her abilities have an objective perspective that human beings typically cannot achieve. She did get bored often and easily. In fact, it is said that

   Cortana seemed to share some of her creator's memories, thoughts, opinions, and even values. When she was asked by Dr. Halsey to pick a "carrier," Cortana chose John-117 for his neural compatibility and his "luck."
   A similar reason used by Halsey for her choice, too. She was not only a facsimile of Dr. Halsey's mind, but also a replica of her physical form, albeit at a younger age.

   Dr. Halsey's and Cortana's relationship started off positive. Cortana assisted Halsey around CASTLE Base
   and even smiled at Halsey's presence.
   As rampancy took hold, Cortana began to distrust and become annoyed at Halsey. Cortana called her a "condescending bitch."
   Even after going to metastability, Cortana called her a monster for her actions in the SPARTAN-II Program.

   She had exhibited extreme devotion to John-117 beyond that which her programming or mission required. She seemed to be most loyal to him and is willing to help him with any task he requested of her. After she found out exactly what happened to John-117 as a child, she decided to protect him from further harm to the best of her abilities without compromising her mission. While a prisoner of the Gravemind, her sanity was pushed to the brink as she eluded the Gravemind's attempts to capture and dissect her for information. Her personal loyalty to and unwavering trust in John-117 helped anchor her and allow her to hold on despite being driven to the point of rampancy. Cortana also believed that she was best qualified to protect John-117 and knew he could get another AI to replace her, but believed that no one would ever look after him like she would. When John came into trouble by the Didact in the New Phoenix Incident, she told the Didact that she wasn't "...doing this for mankind." What was thought to be her final act, was protecting John.

  <p key="1ca9af34-25c0-4b02-851e-5b3f5efbde73">
   She frequently joked about having a relationship with John-117 and it is often implied that the two characters have developed some form of attachment. Prior to Operation: RED FLAG, she says to Dr. Halsey that John-117 is "attractive in a primitive-animal sort of way" while examining a photo of him.
   During the
   Raid on High Charity
   , his mere presence and the reminder of his promise to her were enough for her to pull herself together and help him.
   During the New Phoenix Incident, she sacrificed herself to save John. One of the last things she does is touch him with a life-sized hologram, something she had always wanted to do. When John is devastated by her upcoming death, saying it's his job to look out for her, she tells him they are supposed to look out for each other and they did.

   The Warden Eternal noted Cortana's unusual devotion to John-117, warning her that it would be her downfall as he intended to "stop her reign before it even started". Even when John-117 told her to stand down and abandon her plans, Cortana was not angered, but simply disappointed in his decision. Rather then killing him and Blue Team, she decided to lock them inside a Cryptum to show him the error of his ways.

   Dr. Halsey says that Cortana looks somewhat like

   Cortana was designed to infiltrate computer systems and she is excellent at the task. She has become so intelligent that she understands Covenant technology far more than her makers and in some cases, the Covenant themselves. As of early
   2553
   , she has never encountered a Covenant security measure that she wasn't able to bypass. In addition, she is proficient with UNSC military hardware and can run military ships and stations by herself. Indeed, the UNSC's primary use of AIs is to oversee targeting of point-defense weaponry used in space battles. For Cortana, this is merely an additional capability. She has helped out in several major battles including Operation: FIRST STRIKE. She was capable of storing large amounts of data within her holographic appearance, hiding it in the microscopic lines of code that made up her visual form. Even when she was in the
   Data Crystal Chip
   , microscopic lines of code are running through the holographic "filling."

   armor.
   However, in one instance, she merely needed to be touching another system to access it; however, this is most likely a product of John-117's upgraded armor.
   Quite strangely, she reverted to the data chip; this was probably because John-117's armor was badly damaged during the fall to Earth that it reverted to a back-up system, which also explains its different shield.
   In another instance, instead of having to be physically "plugged in" to the
   hologram projector
   , John can just hold the chip close to it. She then "walked" off it, later "touching" the chip to return to it—holographic representations of the data transfer.

She proved even more adept at using the ship's technology than the Covenant were and was able to perform feats with it the Covenant never even thought of trying. While she was in control of that ship, Cortana was also able to act as the

   Another of her abilities was the ability to clone herself. She got this from a Covenant AI she destroyed and dissected. She first tested it by copying her language translation abilities and found it worked great. She also could seem to sense what progress the clone had made as if she retained a connection to it. Later, due to the importance of her getting to Earth due to all of the data she'd collected on Halo, the Flood and Covenant technology, she was forbidden from going on John-117's mission, but she was able to make a clone of her infiltration abilities to give John enough of her capabilities to infiltrate the Covenant command and control station. She claimed that this would not be a complete copy, but she thought that what it was would be enough. The clone had at least some of her personality as well. The clone retained her abilities to hack systems and some limited mission planning routines that allowed her to make basic plans to help the Spartans, but was unable to make the complicated plans that Cortana could come up with. The original clone made a copy of itself into the station's systems to help out and, due to being overwhelmed by Covenant security AIs, ended up making hundreds of copies of itself which overwhelmed the system and made accomplishing anything hard for the clones as they began to lose their coherent state, but still could control the system. The original clone was left behind in the reactor system. It was placed there to overload the reactors and was never removed once it started the process. All of the clones created on the mission were destroyed when the station blew, but provided invaluable help to the Spartan team. Later, while held captive by the Gravemind, Cortana used her cloning ability to create data-stripped clones of herself and ones of her lower-priority functions to distract the Gravemind. These were all consumed by the Gravemind, but they helped buy Cortana time and one also helped her create her message to John-117. Some were even responsible for the more rampant parts of two of the Cortana Moments. During

It was also her plan that led to the destruction of all of the Flood that had escaped Installation 05 and saved the galaxy from a further Flood invasion. Apparently, she has mission-planning routines that help her with this as her clone told John that a copy had only limited-mission-planning routines and was only able to help the Spartans form basic plans.

   Another ability that she developed was a limited, teleportation ability on Installation 04. She learned how to teleport on Halo while in its control systems, but as she couldn't access Halo's power grid, she couldn't perform this task very often. She did teleport once with John-117 by drawing power from his fusion pack, saying that she was sure it wouldn't cause

   damage to his power pack or shields, but both agreed that this should only be done once. She learned where they needed to go from the Covenant Battlenet and teleported them there although they ended up upside down due to her not getting the coordinates completely right. She has not used this ability since although she could presumably use it on any Halo but would have the same power requirements problem.
