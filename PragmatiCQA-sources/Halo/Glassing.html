   Glassing is a destructive process which signifies an end to a planetary body and begins with the discovery of an enemy controlled world. In most cases the Covenant will immediately begin glassing a planet; however, there are engagements where the Covenant have to deploy ground forces for various reasons, usually to search for or secure a

    Minor Prophet
   </a>
   is assigned to most Covenant fleets to oversee the destruction of a human world; before the fleet is permitted to destroy a planet, the Prophet performs a religious ritual. This process lasts an hour, and when completed, the Prophet declares by which religious significance, marked by a glyph, will the world be destroyed. There is currently only one known instance of a
   human world
   having a glyph burned into its surface.
   The Covenant will then begin glassing the planet by moving their large warships close and blanketing the world with a series of crisscrossing orbits to ensure that every square millimeter of the surface is destroyed.
   Throughout the war, the Covenant have been known to utilize two methods of glassing.

   The first and the most commonly used method is when the Covenant's large warships aim their plasma turrets toward the planet's surface and build up plasma along their lateral lines. The plasma is then discharged in lances from the warship as it continues to orbit the planet. Contained within a magnetic bubble, the lances are guided towards the surface by the ship's automation, striking an area and converting the top soil and other surface geology into a mineral called lechatelierite, similar to glass.
   The process also vaporizes any bodies of water the planet may possess, leaving at most small, ash-choked pools. The ecosystem of a planet is also disposed of through this process. This is repeated until every square millimeter of the planet is destroyed; depending on the planet, the technology and the number of ships in the Covenant fleet, it takes between a few hours and two days to glass a planet.
  </p>
  <p key="51ea7a09-8e79-4cfa-9167-4de73fba31b2">
   The impact of the plasma bolt is similar to that of a nuclear detonation on a much different scale. When the plasma bolt impacts the surface, the magnetic field sustaining and guiding the plasma collapses, and, depending on how powerful the release of energy is, the initial zone of impact is obliterated instantly. The areas outside of the initial impact zone are affected by the heat wave generated by the blast; depending on the range, those immediately outside the blast zone are usually killed instantly by the intense heat. As thermal expansion takes over, the resulting flames fan out and create a pyroclastic surge,
   which will continue to burn the areas it comes into contact with until it has cooled enough that it cannot harm the surface.
  </p>
  <p key="5d32174e-95e2-44c7-8a62-26c0901f45a9">
   Subsequently, the atmosphere is saturated with soot and ash thrown up from the initial impact, subjecting the planet to a nuclear winter. As the initial impact area cools, the surface is covered by extensive areas of molten soil, and is comparable to active volcanic sites. The destructive process leaves the planet unable to recover to its former state. The atmospheres of most planets boil away from the process,
   though there are exceptions, the most notable being

   The second method is used when a ship must effectively destroy a ground target from low range. This method involves focusing plasma though a magnetic envelope from the
   energy projector
   located on the underside of the ship, and then discharging the plasma as a narrow beam. This method of low-range glassing has only been witnessed a few times, most notably during the

   The destruction of a human-controlled world depends on many different factors, from the world itself and its defenses, to the requirements of the Covenant fleet and its commander. Undeveloped human colonies such as atmospheric-contained habitats or stations are typically destroyed while the rest of the world is left unharmed. Well-developed planets that have been terraformed or inhabited are destroyed by many different methods.

    The term "glassing" was originally coined by the

    It seems that when Covenant vessel prepares to glass a planet, during the charging sequence of the energy projector, it becomes more vulnerable to damage. For example, when
