   . Its main benefit is that it is drastically cheaper to produce than the Mjolnir Armor. Realizing that the UNSC could not produce sufficient armor in time for its larger SPARTAN-III forces, the SPI armor was designed with an emphasis on being mass produced and being stealthy rather than on raw strength and power. However, this sacrifice also was a huge hindrance as its lack of durability and offensive capacities resulted in the near wipe out of SPARTAN-IIIs on missions. It features
   special photo-reactive panels
   that mimic the surrounding textures, effectively being the UNSC equivalent to the

   The SPI Armor Mark I was used by the SPARTAN-IIIs of
   Alpha Company
   . It featured hardened plates and photo-reactive panels. Though advanced compared to standard UNSC infantry armor, it could only take a few glancing blows before failing.
   It featured full body armor with an enclosed helmet and
   heads-up display
   , and a supply of oxygen; though only enough for
   seven
   minutes, compared to the Mjolnir Armor’s oxygen supply of ninety minutes. It was also equipped with a cushioning layer of liquid nanocrystals that provided more ballistic protection than three centimeters of
   Kevlar
   diamond weave, without the bulk. The featured photo-reactive panels gave the SPARTANs of Alpha Company a rough equivalent to Active camouflage. The camouflage patterns, however, shifted irregularly and imperfectly, which made the photo-reactive panels inferior compared to the Covenant's Active camouflage technologies.

   The SPI Armor Mark II was a more advanced version of the SPI Mark I, first used by the drill instructors of
   Beta Company
   , and then by the SPARTANs of Beta Company. They had new photo-reactive coating to boost their camouflaging properties. There were also numerous experimental refits to the ballistic gel layers, upgraded software suites, and other functions. Although the new photo-reactive coating could mimic a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, it was still sensitive to overload, so the wearer would still be vulnerable for several seconds after a flashbang or
   plasma
   hit while the panels reset.

   It was proposed in
   2537
   for Alpha Company, but the request was denied because the armor was over budget. After Alpha Company's pyrrhic victory in
   Operation: PROMETHEUS
   , the Mark II SPI armor was approved for mass production. At the time of
   Gamma Company
   's augmentation, system adjustments (upgrades including improved ballistics gel inner layer, updated software suites and new photo-reactive panels) were being beta tested, and were scheduled to be installed within a year of the augmentation procedure.
