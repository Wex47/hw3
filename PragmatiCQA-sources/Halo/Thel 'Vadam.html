  <p key="8d07ae8b-edeb-46f1-9da7-e9faa5baec78">
   Thel was born Thel 'Vadam to the
   Vadam
   family, rulers of the powerful State of Vadam on Sanghelios. As a young Sangheili, Thel was trained in the ways of the warrior by his relative
   Lak 'Vadamee
   .
   He joined the Covenant military, earning him the right to use the "-ee" suffix, which is added to a Sangheilian name upon joining the military. Thel fought alongside the Covenant when they attacked
   Madrigal
   in
   2528
   .
  </p>
  <p key="99c0fcd7-20c4-49d3-9d53-684f15eb4227">
   Soon, Thel gained the rank of Shipmaster and earned the title of Kaidon within his keep.
  </p>
  <p key="81b5f158-47dd-45a9-b1d8-3aa3ad1d5b8b">
   After being promoted to
   Shipmaster
   , Thel suffered an injury in the training ring due to a mistake. His family hushed up the incident, as well as the resultant visit by a doctor, due to Sangheili culture equating the loss of blood and medical operation by a doctor with a loss of honor. During his convalescence, Thel made an old-fashioned
   doarmir
   -fur Shipmaster's cloak, wearing it always to remind him that he could make grave mistakes if he let his guard down.

   Thel's life as Kaidon was important for the Vadam family, as he was tasked with continuing the reign of the powerful State of Vadam. Early in his rule, he was attacked by three Sangheili assassins wielding Energy Swords. He managed to kill all three without even being scratched, but bluffed that he left one alive in order to determine who ordered the attack. He then killed one of the Vadam elders,
   Koida
   , for ordering the failed assassination, and ordered all of his line to leave the keep by sunrise or they would otherwise face execution.

In addition, the ones who built the rings, the Forerunners, died upon firing the rings as planned, contradicting the belief of their "transcendence."

   , leader of the Servants, decided that the time had come to attack 'Vadam and oust him from the mantle of Arbiter. 'Telcam's forces besieged those of the Arbiter at Vadam Keep, but were forced into a stalemate due to fewer keeps joining the uprising than the Servants had expected. However, when Thel 'Vadam permitted Kilo-Five to deploy onto Sanghelios to search for

   in the Temple of Abiding Truth, many Sangheili viewed this as sacrilege, joining 'Telcam's resistance. Thel 'Vadam's forces quickly began to lose ground to the Servants of Abiding Truth, they were quickly surrounded at Vadam Keep and outnumbered. As the Servants began assaulting the Keep, the battle was all but decided. In the final moments both sides were bewildered as a gargantuan human warship, the

    Battle on Ealen IV

  </h3>
  <p key="46808dc3-dc5c-4fe7-ba42-84ed8559fe70">
   Due to an escalation in Jiralhanae raiding parties against the Sangheili throughout joint-occupational zones and the deteriorating state of the overaching
   Sangheili-Jiralhanae war
   , Thel 'Vadam accepted Lord Hood's request to have a peace conference on
   Ealen IV
   with a Jiralhanae Chieftain named
   Lydus
   , in order to gain access to the Jiralhanae resources. Upon meeting Lord Hood, Captain Lasky, Sarah Palmer, and two other Spartan Fireteams on the planet's surface, the three parties then engaged in the conference. During the conference, Thel appealed to Lydus' care for his own race, explaining that the Jiralhanae will eventually turn against each other once there are no other worlds to plunder.
  </p>
  <p key="5505fc58-b750-47f3-b327-3e2204d99089">
   The meeting was soon ambushed by the Covenant Remnant trying to stop the negotiations that were taking place. Surprised by the ambush, Lydus believed that he was deceived by Thel 'Vadam, but Thel quickly reassured him that the Covenant attacking them are not his own troops by saving Lydus' life from the sights of a Kig-Yar sniper. As more of Covenant Remnant troops begin to invade, the three conference parties began to make their way to a human shuttle, only to have it destroyed by Banshees. Commander Palmer shielded Thel with her body from the resulting explosion. With all communications blocked, and no way to contact Infinity for reinforcements, Lasky, Palmer, Lord Hood, the two Spartan Fireteams, and the delegates made their way to a parts depot and sealed themselves inside.
  </p>
  <p key="31618e84-5075-47d4-b3f7-82e233f7db54">
   While all three factions were trapped in a plasma refinement facility, Thel 'Vadam worked out a plan with Lord Hood and Lasky as to how they were going to restore communications, and where they were going to find a more decent shelter. Thel attempted to include Lydus in the planning, only to be accused of working with the Covenant Remnant, an accusation that he quickly rebuffed. When Lasky found a suitable redoubt for the group to stay, he decided to break off from the group with Spartan
   Naiya Ray
   in order to find a way to restore communications.
  </p>
  <p key="651f4f47-f198-4cf5-9250-31f60c8704d5">
   As Thel, the remaining Spartans, Hood, and the Jiralhanae began to make their way to the redoubt, Palmer asked Thel if he thought the Covenant Remnant knew about their path through the underground to the redoubt. He responded that it was very likely. Upon hearing this, Palmer sent the Fireteams out to clear the way. Thel and Lydus insisted on taking part, claiming they were warriors first and diplomats second. However, Palmer convinced them both to leave the fighting to the Spartans, as they were both sent to the planet as peaceful ambassadors.
  </p>
  <p key="491851f6-2449-4d8c-8918-ae4f554c709e">
   It was not long before the group was confronted by a
   Lich
   . The Lich and its troops were quickly destroyed through the swift actions of Palmer. She ordered the Fireteam Jackknife to move onward to the redoubt, while Hood searched the dead enemies for information. Once the dead soldiers were properly inspected, the three factions continued their journey towards the enemy fortified redoubt. Along this route, Lydus demanded that Thel explain how the Jiralhanae can trust the Sangheili if Thel is not able to ensure a peaceful summit.
  </p>
  <p key="5df243fa-2042-4ff8-939d-84df64907a1f">
   Inside the redoubt, Lydus was still unconvinced of Thel and Hood's concern for the Jiralhanae race, accusing both of playing kingmaker. During this conversation, the leader of Fireteam Jackknife,
   Vladimir Scruggs
   , flanked Hood and held him at gun point. As Palmer demanded to know what Scruggs was doing, Lydus began to threaten the traitourous Spartan. Holding out a hand to stop the Chieftan from charging, Thel asked Scruggs for his motives. Scruggs responded that the list is long and explained to Palmer that there are multiple levels of politics that have lead to this point. In particular he pointed out how strange it was that Thel had not been able to achieve stability within the Sangheili on his own over the past five years, hinting at some foul play within the politics.
  </p>
  <p key="42b4f2f9-5e5b-4e49-a537-9a61d5654c7e">
   In the midst of the explanation, Palmer shot Hood in the outer-thigh, causing the Admiral to drop and providing her the opening to attack and eliminate Scruggs. After Hood is bandaged, Thel assisted him on the walk down stairs to a small Covenant tug ship. The ambassadors and Palmer escaped on this ship, with
   DeMarco
   and Fireteam Bailey giving their lives to provide anti-aircraft covering fire. Thel, Lydus, and Hood all parted ways, not having reached an agreement.

   Despite being a former enemy of humanity, Thel has shown a willingness to fight alongside them toward a common goal. Even before peace was established, Thel was willing to work with Avery Johnson to stop Tartarus. Johnson's aid in the fight with Tartarus and the fight he put against him earlier may have earned Vadam's respect as he seemed to respect Johnson in their later encounters. He also showed sorrow at Johnson's death, and said that even beyond death, the Sergeant still guided them. He was also willing to fight side by side and back to back with the Master Chief, someone he once considered a great enemy. Thel also respected humanity enough to be present at a memorial to everyone who fell in the war. While he respected the humans he was wary of their intent and likely had his own reason for having Evan Phillips visiting Sanghelios.
