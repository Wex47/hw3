   During his childhood,  Ackerson used to play with his brother
   Ruwan Ackerson
   . They often imagined that they were fighting a dragon. Together, they created the imaginary
   Key of Osanalan
   whenever they imagined fighting the dragon.

   It was Ackerson who chose
   Kurt-051
   to serve as the commanding officer of the remaining SPARTAN-IIIs.

   With the concurrent project underway, he focused all of his efforts on political maneuvers, rather than battlefield tactics. He was arrogant and condescending to most other people in ONI, even top-ranking brass such as
   Major General
   Nicolas Strauss
   .
  </p>
  <p key="23b7c0fc-0981-4b62-8ff3-4f3d1ba579ee">
   Ackerson headed several high-profile projects at ONI. Because his projects were often competing with
   Dr. Catherine Halsey's
   projects for funds, he had a long-standing rivalry with Halsey and her
   <a href="SPARTAN-II Program.html" key="ac761e6e-b493-4127-b661-17583ee7a651" title="SPARTAN-II Program">

   During the test of
   John-117's

   , he tried to make the SPARTAN fail by authorizing the use of
   Lotus anti-tank mines

   , three 30mm chain-guns, and even an air strike with a
   AV-19 SkyHawk
   against the SPARTAN, severely jeopardizing his life and causing him moderate injury. Ackerson's purpose was to either disgrace the SPARTAN-IIs and Dr. Halsey, or to kill off the most well-known Spartan alive. Nevertheless, John succeeded, and
   Cortana
   , who was also part of the exercise, sought revenge by wreaking havoc in Ackerson's private files, hacking into his personal computer and sending a note requesting reassignment to front line service, and sending a large amount of money from his account to a brothel on Gilgamesh and then sending the bill to his home, where his wife would find it.
   However, he managed to exonerate himself.

   On his computer in
   CASTLE Base
   ,
   Dr. Halsey
   found extensive records of the
   SPARTAN-IIIs
   in a folder called
   S-III
   . One file was labeled
   CPOMZ
   and contained star charts. This suggested to Halsey that
   Chief Petty Officer
   Franklin Mendez
   was involved.

  <p key="c78d7f4e-83d9-4112-8ac0-ea4fd879c628">
   The S-III file contained a folder titled "
   KING UNDER THE MOUNTAIN
   ." It contained the records of the CASTLE Base and a complete survey of
   Menachite Mountain
   , where the original mineral mines were located before they were taken over by ONI. Menachite Mountain was an extinct volcano where Dr. Halsey found the
   Forerunner Crystal
   artifact. Halsey used this to locate the
   SPARTAN-IIIs
   on
   Onyx

   During this interrogation, Ackerson told Lepidus of the
   Key of Osanalan
   , stating it was a Forerunner object located somewhere in
   Cleveland
   ,
   Ohio
   . He told them this to ensure Cleveland's survival because the Covenant would invade rather than destroy it, and Ruwan's knowledge of the Key of Osanalan (that it was a fake) would help others escape the city. Additionally, it would stall the Covenant's Earth campaign.

   Ackerson is a cunning but shortsighted character who often mixes personal glory with more humanitarian goals. His creation of the SPARTAN-III Project, for example, was an effort to "Trade lives for time," but also an attempt to out-do his rival, Catherine Halsey. He can also be savage at times, even eager to put his own petty revenge before the betterment of mankind. During the initial field test of the
   MJOLNIR Mk. V armor
   with
   Cortana
   and
   John-117
   , the Colonel went above and beyond the testing parameters, nearly causing the death of the Spartan and AI, through use of auto-turrets, ODST squads, anti-tank mines and even an airstrike.

    Perhaps the reason Ackerson would not allow a scout to check for survivors on Reach was because, he had a feeling the SPARTAN-II's would have survived, and as stated he was against the II's, even going to length to attempt to kill
