   Silva wanted to engage the Covenant in a medium conflict that would "take the hurt to them. Nothing big, not yet anyway, but the kind of pinpricks that still draw blood," leaving Lieutenant McKay to plan out the mission. She used "crashed" Pelicans (Charlie 217's burned-out remains), mock-injured Marines, and a phony distress call as bait in order to draw in the Covenant. Since
   Wellsley
   believed that the Covenant took the Marines as a serious force after the raid on the Truth and Reconciliation, Wellsley recommended the monitoring of human radio traffic and regular recon flights, allowing them to easily pick the bait.
  </p>
  <p key="208924a6-be79-4dc5-a5f6-e16a6998c1be">
   First, the preparation of arranging for the bait took several hours (They had to scourge for bodies of comrades killed on the butte for "volunteer" casualties.) Sure enough, thirty minutes into the wait, McKay saw a Banshee and signaled for the operation to commence. Members of the third squad, some of whom had mock-injuries, hurried back to cover as the Banshee shot plasma fire at them. The Banshee then went away, presumably to tell the Covenant about a new Human location.
  </p>
  <p key="3ee90974-2cb4-4401-a0ef-5b0d1df13ba4">
   Later, a Spirit Dropship appeared, dropping Kig-Yar, Sangheili, Unggoy, and a pair of Hunters. McKay quickly ordered all the heavy weapons and sniper fire to concentrate on the "walking tanks." Soon enough, they went down. However, the dropship returned and hosed the entire area, forcing the Helljumpers to take cover.
   Thus encouraged, the Covenant rushed into the rocks to engage. However, the snipers managed to pick off five alien soldiers before the dropship exacted the position. Two snipers were killed by plasma, and another was wounded.
  </p>
  <p key="e8482f55-139b-4f0c-867c-067321bfa1a9">
   Soon, the mission turned ugly, as the Covenant engaged in hide-and-seek with the Marines. Just as McKay was about to order a retreat, something even worse appeared.
  </p>
  <p key="f572cd84-2f9f-4c58-893e-6f6112c6f939">
   Suddenly, the bizarre creatures, also known as the Flood, attacked both groups. While the Covenant had experience with the Flood, the Helljumpers simply had never seen them before. Three members of the second squad were going down under the Infection forms, while another was being massacred by the Combat forms. Confused pleas and requests for extraction filled the radio, tripling the radio traffic. McKay received her first look when she noticed a Unggoy with two Infection forms; she put down the trio with a sustained burst. However, then, Pvt. Jenkin's Combat form jumped out, hoping to be killed by the Lieutenant. In order to collect a specimen, she sidestepped and restrained the Flood form. To kill the Flood, the Marines and Covenant temporarily joined forces, and eliminated the Flood after 15 minutes. They then proceeded to return to their hide-and-seek. Finally, with half the Marines killed, the UNSC claimed a victory.

Meanwhile, McKay's troops stormed the area surrounding the grav lift, killed the security team guarding it, and entered the ship. Using the schematics from the previous raid, the humans quickly secured the ship's engine room, as well as 80% of the ship. While the human technicians studied the ship's controls, and Wellsley activated the ship's engines, a small group of Flood attacked the engine room. The Flood were quickly subdued, but the attack caused McKay to urge Major Silva to set the ship down and eradicate the Flood on board. Silva, however, believed that intact Flood specimens would gain him an instant promotion back on Earth and refused to listen. Once McKay returned to her post,
