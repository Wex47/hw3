   Installation 00 is a part of the Forerunner construct designed to wipe the Flood from the
   Galaxy
   . Located about 2
   (262,144) light years from the galactic center,
   Installation 00 is located outside the galaxy and is thus safe from the
   Halo
   effect (as it is referred to by the Forerunners in the terminal transcripts) that kills all organic sentient lifeforms. The main Forerunner behind its use was the
   Iso-Didact
   . The commission of this installation is to remotely activate the seven
   Halo
   rings then in existence, from outside the pulse radius of the array. This is a fail-safe system, and is only activated by an aborted firing such as the one that occurred at the end of the Battle of Installation 05 (Delta Halo). In addition, Installation 00 can also function as an automated factory to construct replacement Halo installations, thereby ensuring that the Halo array is always ready to fire, should the array be needed.

   However, things did not go as planned, as the Forerunner military AI
   032 Mendicant Bias
   turned on the Forerunners after considerable convincing from a Gravemind, and began assisting the Flood. Mendicant Bias knew of the Ark, how to access it through Forerunner
   Key Ships
   (only Lifeworkers had slipspace privileges at the time due to indexing requirements), but did not know of its exact location outside of the Milky Way Galaxy. The Ecumene Council then commissioned another military AI,
   Offensive Bias
   , in order to devise the best possible defense against Mendicant Bias, his fleet, and the impending attack against the Maginot Line. The Librarian scuttled all of the Key Ships under her command.

The armature's origin was subjected to debate, but it was believed by the team to be the source of the beacon picked up by the initial investigative group.
   The device was a broken, barely active monitor which eventually revealed to be 343 Guilty Spark. Claiming that he knew the location of the

   Installation 00 resembles a massive wheel with a series of eight curved arms retreating from its centre, similar to a sea star and bearing similarities to a sun. The
   Ark Core
   is the stripped remnant of a material-rich planetoid, asteroid, or other celestial body used for the construction of the
   Halos
   , which the Ark constructs. The entire upper surface is terraformed and has a multitude of environments, with oceans, forests and even a large desert, where
   John-117
   first makes landfall. At the time of construction, the Ark lacked its core and a livable surface with no land or water. The structure is the second largest known

   (such as
   Shield 0006
   ) which has a diameter of 300 million kilometers. A simple inspection of the holographic representation reveals the Ark to be anywhere from 90,000 to 100,000 kilometers (55,890 to 62,100 miles) in diameter.

  <p key="d69dd7cb-d840-40ed-a274-231ed0fa125a">
   The three shown primary functions of Installation 00 are to act as a remote for activating the entire Halo Array network while safely out of the Halos' range, as an automated construction facility for the creation of replacement
   Halo
   installations (ensuring that the network continues to operate even if any rings are destroyed), and it has also been confirmed that the Ark was meant to be used to reseed the galaxy in the event of the Halo Arrays being fired. Held deep within its mysteries was a collection of every species the Forerunners had studied and governed over. How this plan was to be initiated is still unknown, although, gleaning information from how the Milky Way Galaxy was reseeded eventually, the same conventions and constructs would have most likely been used, such as automated data logs for the retrieval and reseeding of the galaxy through means of Forerunner Key ships which were found on several planets in the galaxy such as Earth and the San'Shyuum home world of Janjur Qom.

   Most interestingly, the Ark is not actually in the
   Milky Way
   .
   The Ark is in the void in between galaxies, known as intergalactic space. As such, it's outside the believed range of any
   Halo
   installation. The Ark also has an artificial sun floating above it.

   and on the majority of the
   Central Hub
   . This surface is divided up into "
   Refugia
   ".
   These Refugia are as diverse as those of Earth and even of the Halos, consisting of deserts,
   taiga forests,
   and deciduous forests.
   Several bodies of water are dotted around the area as well. As such, the Ark can sustain its own ecosystem, providing a variety of habitation for many kinds of life. If the Halos were fired, all forms of life could thrive and reproduce in the Ark's highly varied ecosystem, eventually being able to return to the Milky Way to recreate a full food chain on each planet. The diverse locations may also assist in the studies of the Flood in a natural, but isolated, environment.

   As the Ark is outside of the galaxy, isolated in a black void of space, there are no nearby natural sources of light to power the Installation and facilitate the survival of biological organisms on its surface. To counter this problem, the Ark is equipped with an artificial structure consisting of a bright, sun-like light, with several metal arms jutting from its center.
   From aerial pictures of the Installation, it seems the light source "scans" over certain areas to generate day/night cycles, further contributing to the growth of vegetation and controlling weather patterns.

   The Strip Mining Moon is the open area at the heart of Installation 00, which is surrounded by a void, and is the automated factory for replacement Halo installations. This void conceals the
   Halo
   Foundry, which constructs the Halo Rings and sends them to their orbital destinations. Raw materials for the process are supplied by a planetoid roughly 1/3 the size of
   Earth
   . The moon is large enough to make several replacement installations, as seen in

   The intense heat generated by the Ark's Foundry, where the Halo Rings are constructed, heats the Ark up so much that multiple cooling stations are needed. At least two systems span a snowy gorge at one point or it could be that the massive cooling systems are causing this icy climate due to their nature. The systems are long, and they curve up, retreating from the Foundry of the Ark. Above the systems are small bridges, as well as two stations on each side.

   Unlike other installations, there are actually multiple Cartographers on the Ark. They are updated in real time with information on the Ark's superstructure, the progress of any Halo being built and the status of any Refugia on the installation. Due to the magnitude of this information, Sentinels are more aggressive around Cartographers than normal.
