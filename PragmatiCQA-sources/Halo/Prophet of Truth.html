   . The Kig-Yar planned to render the Unggoy infertile, as petty revenge for the displacement of Kig-Yar nests caused by a recent boom in Unggoy population. Although Casto recommended stiff penalties, the
   Minister of Concert
   decided to simply fine the Kig-Yar involved. Casto lodged a formal complaint, but was rebuffed by his superiors. However, the Infusion Incident quickly escalated into a bloody skirmish known as the
   Unggoy Rebellion
   , bringing about the
   39th Age of Conflict
   . After the Unggoy were pacified and brought back into the Covenant, the

   began, and Casto was promoted to Minister of Fortitude. Throughout his service in this position, Fortitude worked hard to see that Forerunner technology was evenly distributed among the member races to prevent another Age of Conflict. Fortitude was on the
   Roll of Celibates
   , a list of San'Shyuum not allowed to breed due to their weak genes. This did not, however, particularly bother him.
   As the Minister of Fortitude, he was fond of smoking, yet he rarely used the hookah tobaccos favored by his senior staff.

   ) that a
   Luminary
   had discovered on that planet. Tranquility planned to use these artifacts to spring himself into a position of high power, as a Hierarch of the Covenant, and offered the same for Fortitude. This marked the first alliance between the Prophets and the Jiralhanae, as Tranquility wisely decided to use them to retrieve these artifacts, rather than upset the fine balance of power by allowing the Sangheili to gain the treasures.

   In order to push the three current Hierarchs,
   Tolerance
   ,
   Obligation
   and
   Restraint
   from their positions, Fortitude utilized blackmail against the Prophet of Restraint. Tranquility had shown himself as a sympathizer for those blacklisted from reproducing due to inborn genes, after being urged to do so by Fortitude who was aware that Restraint had illegitimately fathered two children. The Prophet of Restraint offered Tranquility a high position if he would adopt the children, but the scheming Prophets instead used this to their advantage, blackmailing him and forcing the Prophet to step down or have his scandalous affair made public.

   . This was a massive revelation with great implications for the whole Covenant: If humans were the chosen successors of the Forerunners (or were surviving Forerunners themselves) yet had not transcended when the Sacred Rings were last activated, then that meant that the Halos would not necessarily provide godhood to all who walked the divine path.

   disillusioned Elite

After returning to High Charity, Truth looked on the positive side, saying they had purged possible human-sympathizing Kig-Yar and Unggoy, and because of the modified weapons, found two more human worlds.

   This led Truth to put his "divisive mandate" in motion. Secretly, he devised a complex scheme to eventually replace the Sangheili with the Jiralhanae as his personal guardians, as well as the primary warrior race of the Covenant. This started with subtle gestures that soon became
   more and more drastic

All of these forces were commanded exclusively by the Jiralhanae, a fact that Truth planned to put to great use in his plans to replace the Sangheili with the Jiralhanae after the fleet destroyed the humans once and for all. This plan had more immediate advantages as well; when the time came for Truth to return his attention to Earth, his forces needed to be led by Jiralhanae, not Sangheili.

   Although Tartarus' attempt to activate Delta Halo had failed, ending in the Brute Chieftain's death, Truth was not deterred, going back to the Artifact which Regret had sought. Truth took off from High Charity on board the Forerunner dreadnought, severing the ancient vessel from the city's power grid. Unknowingly carrying Spartan-117 on board the ship, Truth headed for Earth, and after his fleet managed to defeat the orbital defenses, he landed the Dreadnought in the middle of the Artifact, which his troops had nearly excavated during the four weeks since their arrival. While the digging was still in process, Truth broadcast to
   a UNSC base
   , declaring that Human extinction was inevitable and not even their "Demon" could stop him.

   Once the Artifact was fully uncovered, Truth landed "his" Dreadnought directly on it, while his troops set up air defenses around the perimeter. Nonetheless, the UNSC managed to break through the defenses and assaulted the Dreadnought. However, Truth successfully activated the Artifact, opening a portal to the Ark. After getting through this portal and traveling to an activation room on the installation, he activated a barrier around the Ark's Citadel and Core to shield himself from attack and captured

   Johnson was saddened by Keyes' death and reluctantly began to fire up the rings, but was halted when John-117, the Arbiter and the Flood suddenly attacked to stop him from doing so. Truth then broadcasted his final message to his remaining followers, who were quickly killed by the combined group.

   After his guards were finished off by the Flood, Truth found himself being overtaken by the Gravemind's infection. Thel 'Vadam warned Gravemind not to infect the Prophet, desiring to have his revenge on the deceitful San'Shyuum. In his last moments, Truth still believed he would transcend as a god, while the Gravemind spoke through him and stated that he would be food and nothing more.
  </p>
  <p key="4e11916a-0634-45b7-a82b-4b845e6159cf">
   Before his very last words, Thel 'Vadam held Truth up by his throat so he could watch John-117 halt all of his plans by shutting down the Ark and thereby all the Halo rings. He yelled his last words, referring to himself as the voice of the Covenant, before being "silenced" by 'Vadam's
   Energy Sword
   . With his death, the Covenant had been beheaded, finally bringing the Human-Covenant war, and the Covenant Civil War, to an end.

  <p key="b7c9d734-730a-4764-9173-d031a06aca12">
   Seeing that during Thel 'Vadamee's trial he expressed little or no emotion whatsoever despite the fact that Installation 04 was destroyed, it seemed at first that Truth had a very calm and stoic nature, giving him a hardy, stone-faced personality. However, he was quick to become impatient and angry towards those, like his fellow Hierarch, Regret, who angered him, or did something foolish or reckless. An example of this was when Truth sent a transmission to Regret, scolding him on how rash he was to attack Earth.
  </p>
  <p key="2d722852-c25d-4b6d-8ff7-3466db43ccaa">
   However, the reason he acted harshly toward Regret may have been because he worried that Regret would end up dead or worse, according to a
   letter
   he wrote to Mercy saying that he is "perhaps worrying too much." This is probably not the real reason, however, because the Prophet has been very cold to his other allies to the point of having them killed - Tartarus, Mercy, Thel 'Vadamee, and Regret himself - likely because he wanted to gain more power over the Covenant by eliminating all possible competition. After arriving on Earth, Truth appears noticeably more aggressive and impatient, possibly having grown more annoyed by the "Demon" interfering in his plans or eager to bring about the Great Journey now that it is so close, especially with the Journey having been prevented twice previously. Ironically, contrary to his name, Truth is very deceptive, frequently lying or covering up certain events to accomplish his goals. He tells the Covenant that it was the Brutes who found the Sacred Icon instead of 'Vadamee, who truly discovered it, in an attempt to boost the Brutes' popularity among the lower races of the Covenant, while also alienating the Elites. Truth also secretly orders the killing of Thel 'Vadamee by the Brute Chieftain Tartarus after he has finished using him, as well as the assassination of the Elite council members, knowing of the Brutes' own rivalry with the Sangheili and manipulating them to follow along with his plans. Another example is the fact that he stated that the Prophet of Mercy was by his side in the level
   High Charity
   , when in fact, Mercy had died in an attack by the Flood moments earlier. Truth mercilessly denied him help, stating that "the Great Journey waits for no one." During the events of
   <i key="3e9658c9-fa69-4bf6-bc08-84902b2afc1a">

   , however, he had acknowledged that he would have to be deceitful in order to "maintain the Covenant" by claiming that the humans were trying to steal and destroy Forerunner relics, when, in fact, the Forerunner glyphs were mistranslated as "Reclamation" instead of "

   <i key="cbbcfd17-fb94-44bf-9f8d-df2875514453">

   ), Truth exhibits many psychopathic traits and even shows a slight sadistic side. It would seem that he loses his cool, calm behavior when face-to-face with a formidable enemy, such as Thel 'Vadam or John-117, or that he enjoys the torture or death of his foes.
  </p>
  <p key="c6111376-15d5-42c1-97aa-2235bf401b8f">
   Although inspiring and charismatic, it is likely that Truth is at least partially insane, considering how fanatical and manipulative he is. He was solely responsible for the Covenant Civil War, along with Mercy's and Regret's easily preventable deaths.

  <p key="0bf8a86a-1cf6-421a-a6cc-e991944e171e">

   Choices in allowing both the Prophet of Mercy and Prophet of Regret to die seem to suggest that he wanted supreme power over the entire Covenant, yet he already seemed to possess a high amount of power over the other Hierarchs.

  <p key="e6878c6d-8fd9-4418-83b4-b5f38b1c82f9">
   After the death of the Prophet of Regret, the Prophet of Truth charged the Elites with no longer being able to guarantee their safety, and despite arguments that they could have stopped SPARTAN-117 if they had not been withdrawn due to his order, the Prophet began to set in motion a plan that was clearly preconceived: the shifting of power within the Covenant that elevated the Brutes into the former Elite position of the Prophets' protectors. He killed two birds with one stone - one, giving himself greater power after Regret's death, and two, passing power to the Brutes before the Schism.
  </p>
  <p key="9a8993e1-6015-4eac-874e-ab774abd3a27">
   Though the Prophet has questioned and learned from
   343 Guilty Spark
   , it is not truly known if he believes in and desires to transcend on the "Great Journey." As the Minister of Fortitude he learned from the AI stationed on the Forerunner dreadnought, Mendicant Bias, that the humans were the heirs of all the Forerunners left behind. Due to this knowledge, he concealed the truth, which would shatter the Covenant if the masses learned that some of them could be left behind when the Halos were activated, by having the AI's connections to the Dreadnought severed as much as possible and initiating the Human-Covenant war, which would cost billions of lives. Although it is only speculation, it is possible that Truth always intended to journey to the Ark, explaining why he was so eager to allow both Regret and Mercy to perish, clearing his path. He may have sought to activate the rings while safe in the Ark to clear all of his nemeses, both Elites and humans alike. This theory is apparently supported by the fact that on the
   <i key="70f4b75c-8c71-4caf-8129-a3eed2eac36e">
    Halo 3

   level,
   The Ark
   , he refers to the Ark as "this shelter from Halo's fire," which also may lead to the fact that he told the Covenant the truth and what power the whole empire would wield during the beginning of the Covenant Civil War.
  </p>
  <p key="662494e7-fc40-49eb-881c-58008f6856a5">
   This theory is rendered extremely unlikely, however, given that the entire reason he instigated the

   was to prevent this precise truth from being revealed. An interesting note is that when Johnson asks Truth, "Can't start your own party?" Truth replies: "I admit. I need your help. But that secret dies with all the rest." This indicates that he ordered the Brutes to capture a human, but did not tell them why, supporting the idea that the Loyalist Covenant remains in the dark as far as the

  <p key="eff33018-48e0-4112-a6f2-7e74b4a90c5a">
   Some part of Truth's animosity towards the Sangheili may stem from the fact that both races competed in

   Although a description for the Prophet describes him as "deluded, possibly insane" as well as a true believer, it is noted that he has always been far less ascetic in his views, even while still the Minister of Fortitude, accepting the dogma but not usually acting in particular reverence toward it.
   This continued later on in his career as a Hierarch, most likely because he was partially disillusioned to the

   All of Truth's actions can be seen as a means to preserve the Covenant. He declared war on humanity in order to keep the Covenant from learning that the Great Journey was a lie, which would tear it apart.
   When Sangheili came closer to finding out that the Great Journey was a lie, as with
   Sesa 'Refumee's heretic faction

This is described in page 325: "In the center of the chamber, floating on the floor of the imperial dais, sat the High Prophet of Truth. Its body was barely discernible, covered by a broad red cape, and on its head sat a bright ornament, with sensors and breathing apparatus that extended like an insect's antennae.
     Only its snout and dark eyes stood out, along with its small claws and its golden robes from the sleeves. "
