   The Library's true function is unknown at present. However it is hypothesized to be a collection of all information regarding the
   <a href="Flood.html" key="8de2103b-6e46-4cfc-945f-4abdfd15ca00" title="Flood">
    Flood
   </a>
   known to the Forerunner and also collated cloned DNA sequences. All of this information is contained within the
   Index
   , which is housed within the
   Index Chamber
   and is used in the process of activating the
   Halo
   system and wiping the galaxy clean of sentient life.
  </p>
  <p key="3348a5be-26e3-40cb-80a3-ef303b89767e">
   The Index is suspended within the core of the Library, out of reach of possible Flood outbreak. The only internal access is via a giant lift that descends from the highest level of the Library to the Index's suspended position.
  </p>
  <p key="6940ff62-da9a-49c8-9f15-0a3f04528a8a">
   Access to the Library itself usually occurs via each installation's internal teleportation grid.
   On
   Installation 05
   2401 Penitent Tangent
   was unable to assist the
   Arbiter
   in this manner. As a result a longer, less direct route had to be taken. An Anti-Gravity
   Gondola
   spanned the distance between a Forerunner base and the Library. This large Forerunner base was the
   Sentinel Wall
   which was protected by an energy shield and filled with hundreds if not thousands of
   <a href="Z-1500 Automated Systems Drone.html" key="7a7f09e4-dc42-4319-882e-7df39ab0e55a" title="Z-1500 Automated Systems Drone">

   On both
   Installation 04
   and
   Installation 05
   the Flood was still able to breach such defenses and infest the Library. This may indicate that the Library is not as secure as the Forerunners had hoped it would be, or that it was initially a containment facility for the Flood. The interior of both Libraries consists of multiple gigantic hallways of geometric design interconnected with one another, finally leading to the Index Room. The large hallways suggests that it was designed to hold large numbers of

   . Making specific reference to their technological superiority, he wonders why John had brought "such ineffective weapons to combat the Flood."
   Guilty Spark also recommends that John-117 should upgrade from his current
   Mjolnir Armor
   , a
   Mark V
   (which according to a Forerunner ranking system is only Class 2) to a Class 12
   Combat Skin
   , which is stated as a necessity in order to combat the Flood. However, he later tells John-117 that his suit will serve him well as the Flood would try to alter the atmosphere for their own needs (possibly referring to the Flood spores spreading throughout the facility).

   The Flood had heavily infested this library in the few short days since their initial breakout, with large groups using the ventilation shafts and access corridors to make their way through the facility. There were Flood in almost every part of the complex, including the
   Index Chamber
   itself, and the Sentinel drones assigned to the facility were mostly overwhelmed. By the time John arrived, the Sentinels were reduced to small groups using the shafts to avoid destruction and the Flood had begun terraforming, spreading their spores through the facility by using the ducts.

  <p key="6ffa3e90-4e65-4f68-ade2-ecf3fba8db2b">
   Toward the end of this Library, John encountered the body of a

  <p key="9bd33cad-8528-4781-a2f4-1cff929feb98">
   It seems the Covenant made no attempt to access the Library on Installation 04. While John-117 explored the dark bowels of the structure, there is no sign of the usual crates, shield generators or spare weapons. This is probably because the Covenant did not find out about the Library, the Index or its purpose until after the capture of Monitor
   343 Guilty Spark
   .

   The Arbiter took the gondola into the depths of the Library to find the Index Chamber. This inner section of the Library was identical to Installation 04's. After the Arbiter knocked Johnson unconscious, Tartarus and his Brute forces arrived. Tartarus pulled Keyes toward him with the Fist of Rukt, stunning her in the process, and removed the Index from her possession. Tartarus then

It should be noted that in the Index Room the elevator is broken on the bottom level (opposed to being at the top like in Installation 04's), there is also what appears to be multiple destroyed Enforcers, as well as a number of the Gravemind's tentacles. A large part of the Gravemind exists beneath the Library itself, and this is where 2401 Penitent Tangent and the Flood Infected
