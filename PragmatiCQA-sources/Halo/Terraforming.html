    Terraforming
   </b>
   is the process in which a planet is changed or "formed" to suit the needs of those terraforming the planet. It normally involves inserting plants and/or flora, introducing new minerals or substances, or other changes to fulfill the required goals for the planet in question. It can take up to several centuries to fully terraform an
   Earth
   -sized planet, or even slightly larger. The

   The UNSC uses devices known as "Atmospheric Processors" to change a planet's atmosphere towards sustainability, but human terraforming technology has its limits. Completely uninhabitable planets cannot be rebuilt, which often results in the UNSC seeking already habitable planets. Understandably, these are extremely few and far between, which results in some colonies being extremely remote.
   Still, the UNSC has several methods to terraform worlds, including a spallation-heavy process where another mantle is laid over the planet's natural one. This process is known to trap
   helium-3
   into the second, artificial mantle. At least the colony world
   Verge
   was known to have required this type of terraforming.

   , humanity began to re-terraform their colony worlds glassed by the Covenant during the conflict, possibly including
   Reach
   , which had been mostly glassed, but at least one area remained untouched by
