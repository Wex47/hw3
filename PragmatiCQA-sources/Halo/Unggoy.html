   Very little information about the Unggoy prior to the activation of the Halo array survives to the modern era, but it is known that theirs was a Tier 4 society. However, they never became spacefaring due to a number of factors. Their species' rapid breeding cycle led to a population crisis on their homeworld of
   Balaho
   , which was reflected in and compounded by the near complete collapse of the planet's biosphere due to global industrialization.
  </p>
  <p key="bfd43cc3-a007-4922-ace8-6cf9bead24b4">
   Balaho's atmosphere and hydrosphere were severely damaged by industrial waste. It's speculated that the planet was home to thousands of fish and avian species prior to industrialization; afterward, eight out of every ten species was driven to extinction. Naturally, this led to a shortage of basic resources necessary for survival, which in turn began a brief but devastating resource war that left the Unggoy all but bereft of any means of self-sufficiency. Entire clans were destroyed, cities razed and any semblance of government was nonexistent; they had fallen into a state of self-preservation and no longer possessed the resources to lift themselves back up from the pit they had thrown themselves into.

   and Sangheili, Unggoy were the sixth client race to be integrated into the Covenant, coming to their indoctrination at around
   2142

   While they are essentially a slave race, the Unggoy have managed to largely retain their cultural identity and rebelled in the past
   several times
   . Being the lowest-ranked species of the Covenant, they are bitter rivals with the

  <p key="5ea26c92-32be-4ea3-8f92-4ed29054d965">
   Despite the low position they occupy in the Covenant Hierarchy, the true irony is that the Unggoy's entry into the Covenant has ensured their species' survival. Membership in the Covenant granted the Unggoy freedom from risk of extinction during Balaho's two winters, as they now have access to sufficient supplies of food. Infant mortality has decreased to below fifty percent since joining the Covenant, and
   geronticide
   is no longer a necessity for survival. The average life expectancy for non-combatant Unggoy has doubled.
   Their incorporation into the Covenant likely also alleviated the threat of the
   Blue Death
   , which Unggoy typically fear.

   Unggoy are poor warriors in terms of skill and physique. Their focus is nominal at best, their natural posture inhibits quick movement, they lack any meaningful tactical or strategic ability and their constitution is generally unsound. When witnessing their commanders eliminated during a battle, they often go into a panic and scatter in random directions. However, what they lack in skill and prowess they make up for with sheer numbers and tenacity; also

   Unggoy are the only species known to breathe
   methane
   rather than
   oxygen
   . Their combat harnesses have integrated methane breather systems, as they are unable to survive long periods without methane due to asphyxiation much like humans without oxygen. Therefore, if the player manages to knock their methane tank off in a melee attack they will die after a short amount of time. Also, it is possible in

   Fairly intelligent, cowardly and not very creative on the battlefield, Unggoy are one of the most gregarious and sociable of the Covenant races and possess a very strong pack mentality, often associating with each other in groups. Although quite capable of operating weaponry, vehicles and machinery such as Ghosts and Shades, Unggoy are thought to be unintelligent. This is most likely due to stereotyping created by higher-ranking species such as Sangheili and Jiralhanae, who have grown accustomed to expecting blind obedience from subordinates.

   The Unggoy seem to outnumber the other races to a large degree and might offer impressive resistance if properly organized. They have been called "cannon fodder" because their Sangheili or Jiralhanae leaders will often send them out to serve as a distraction, rather than actually having them effectively engage an enemy in combat. This numerical superiority and pack mentality allows for their sense of cultural identity to remain, despite a number of hardships, including their extreme subservience to the other races of the Covenant, as well as the
   dark time
   following
   reintroduction
   after the activation of the Halo Array.

  <p key="c753c117-24f3-41ce-be82-8d4b34e5c9cc">
   An inherent psychological advantage possessed by the Unggoy are their unburdened neural pathways, which allow the Unggoy to absorb knowledge more freely compared to the other Covenant species. As such, they are often tasked with monitoring space for traces of human communication. In addition, many Unggoy have developed a clear understanding of two or even three human languages. This advantage serves as a river of confidence in times of great stress for them.
  </p>
  <p key="18c4d7c6-9d9c-4e9b-853b-1bf899b55118">
   Unggoy generally follow a few short, simple guidelines given to them by the Sangheili, namely "when in doubt, shoot," or "stay out of the way, live another day." Despite being held in low stature in the Covenant, many Unggoy appear to be strong followers of their religion. Their Deacons will often hold sermons onboard ships to boost the morale and teach the Unggoy onboard about the Covenant. For instance, a Deacon named Dadab gave sermons and taught the Unggoy on board a Jiralhanae cruiser about the Covenant and its religions. The Jiralhanae allowed Dadab these teachings because they believed that it would help the Unggoy become more competent and helpful.

   . Like primates, they walk both bipedally and with the aid of their oversized forearms in a manner similar to a chimpanzee. Their bodies are armored with a hard exoskeleton, much like crabs and insects. Their mouths have a set of small, pointed teeth, much like reptiles. However, the UNSC has classified them taxonomically as being most similar to Earth arthropods, but being alien in nature, they still aren't technically arthropods.

  <p key="1ac63acb-c79d-45c7-aa4e-a17005823037">
   Unggoy are on average about five feet tall and are relatively weak compared to other species. Although they can easily walk upright on two legs, they may often use their arms to move in a quadrupedal fashion. While carrying armaments, they are forced to walk upright so that they may support their weapons with their hands, but while trying to flee, or while patrolling without a weapon drawn, they use their oversize arms as forelegs to add speed or stability to their gait. Their eyesight and hearing are average and they seem to have a very well-developed sense of smell, sometimes sniffing the air to detect traces of foes or hidden threats.
   This is facilitated through the olfactory membranes installed in their masks.

   Unggoy also have thick, bio-luminescent,

   possibly a result of methane-based proteins in the blood to facilitate methane-based respiration. Like Earth's horseshoe crabs, it is possible that their blood is blue due to high copper content.

   Although they require an atmosphere to breathe, Unggoy are capable of surviving in the vacuum of space without sealed, full-body gear. Unggoy carapaces apparently can withstand the chilling cold and airless environment of EVA conditions, but they must employ sealed face masks in order to breathe, as well as presumably to protect their facial tissues. In the post-war era, the Unggoy seem less able to survive without a mask and are less armored.

   Unggoy breed prodigiously, with large egg clutches and short childhood periods.
   Combined with the large number of young per clutch and rapid sensory-motor integration development, this was one of the primary reasons why the Covenant cleverly used the Unggoy's breeding habits to their advantage in battle, deploying the Unggoy as cannon fodder. Overpopulation is a serious problem in peacetime and strict laws are enacted regarding when and how many Unggoy can breed.

   Unggoy do value their ties to their offspring, but are usually separated from their families at an early age by the requirements of military service to the Covenant. They resent this greatly, but because of their low social status in the Covenant, they are unable to muster any response. Unggoy also have multiple fathers and mothers.
   Though, its unknown if all but two are genetically related to the offspring.

   The Unggoy's culture has been largely erased by their incorporation into the Covenant. They have been granted very few civil rights in comparison to other members of the Covenant and on a good day they are treated like second-class citizens. Despite the advances in civil rights granted after the Unggoy Rebellion, including the right to carry weapons and hold places among infantry units, their representation on the High Council is mostly powerless. The negative aspects of their existence are offset by the irony of their continued survival due to the acceptance of the Covenant. The entire species is no longer at risk of being eradicated by two consecutive horrible winter seasons, as they had on their homeworld of Balaho, a swampy planet with a methane atmosphere. Infant mortality is now below 50 percent. Average life expectancy has more than doubled (not including combat personnel). Geronticide is no longer a necessity for the survival of the tribe. Producing enough food to last through the winter season and burning plague victims no longer rank as the top two priorities on their daily chores.

They are more fanatical than regular Unggoy, and are more dangerous as a result. They serve the same role as Unggoy Minors in the original Covenant. Their armor can be found in many colors including orange, blue, red, green, yellow, etc. Unggoy Storm, like their Unggoy Minor counterparts are cowardly, but they are as fanatical as the Sangheili they serve under.

   These Unggoy have different methane tubes than their non-Heretic counterparts. They use two rounded tubes, instead of the triangular shape. Another feature of the Heretic Unggoy armor is a small mouth breather that exposes an Unggoy's teeth. Unlike the armor of the
   Heretic Sangheili
   , there is only one uniform color for an Unggoy's armor, which is a shining, golden-brown. Because of this, there is no hierarchy or ranking system, and Heretic Unggoy are inferior only to Heretic Sangheili. Heretic Unggoy are also superior to their Covenant counterparts by their equipment and usage thereof. They almost always use needlers or occasionally fuel rod guns, but never the plasma pistols that are often wielded by their counterparts. They set up turrets like the Heavy Unggoy. They are better treated than their Covenant counterparts, and are not used as cannon fodder. It's also worth noting that Heretic Unggoy are much harder to kill than normal Unggoy. Typical Unggoy can be killed with two or three shots on normal via Carbine, but Heretic Unggoy can absorb up to five shots before dying.

   , the Unggoy are the main infantry unit, serving as the Covenant equivalent to the Marine. They start with a plasma pistol and three in each squad, but they can be upgraded with Needlers. When upgraded to Needlers, they seem to also function as anti-air units as well due to their projectiles setting off a Hornet's chaff pods and doing extra damage towards enemy aircraft.
