   While the immediate objective for SPARTAN-117 and his Marines was to push through the Covenant-held Forerunner ruins and assassinate the Prophet of Regret, the overall UNSC objective for Installation 05 was to ensure that the Covenant would not activate the ring and extinguish all sentient life in the galaxy. To accomplish this objective, the UNSC ground forces moved to capture the
   Library
   and retrieve the installation's
   Index
   , thereby preventing the Covenant from using it to fire the ring.

  <p key="34ddf2b8-ab55-4867-aabe-d04bba2b1660">
   After SPARTAN-117 and his men pushed through two Forerunner ruins, another Pelican air-dropped
   Resupply Canisters
   and a small number of Marines, refueling the UNSC offensive as they advanced through a ravine defended by
   Kig-Yar Snipers
   and Yanme'e. They proceeded to another temple, this one with a hologram of the Prophet of Regret, who was sermonizing in a main Forerunner temple to prepare for the activation of the ring and the sublimation event of the "
   Great Journey
   ." After learning all of the information the Prophet could provide, his elimination became the primary objective for SPARTAN-117, as his death would destabilize the Covenant politically and religiously. After
   Cortana
   deciphered the hologram, SPARTAN-117 and a pair of Marines battled through a pair of Covenant-held temples before reaching an open platform. At this time, the Covenant became aware of UNSC activity, and increased their defenses. Commander Keyes responded by sending several Pelicans towards John-117, which air-dropped more Resupply Canisters on the platform.

The UNSC, after clearing out the last ruins, were able to secure a landing zone for a Pelican to air-drop Resupply Canisters and a team of Marines, who aided SPARTAN-117 in the final push towards the main temple. The UNSC forces commandeered an additional gondola they found near the tower. Despite heavy resistance from Banshees and

   Responding to a distress signal from Regret,

   A large contingent of Honor Guards and Unggoy defended the Prophet. These forces were quickly bested however, and SPARTAN-117 attacked his target directly. Eschewing firearms which were useless against Regret's force shield, Master Chief boarded the High Prophet's gravity throne and beat him to death with MJOLNIR enhanced blows. Shortly thereafter, a Covenant Assault Carrier repositioned over the main temple, destroying it with a gravity beam and killing all remaining Covenant and UNSC forces on site. SPARTAN-117 jumped (or fell) into the lake with seconds to spare and was grasped by the tentacles of the
   Gravemind

   After the Prophet of Regret had been murdered, an event that would soon help to spark the Covenant Civil War, the UNSC and the Covenant both raced to reach the Library and seize the Index.

   After the assassination of Regret, Rtas 'Vadumee was furious at the Prophet of Truth for withdrawing his men at the last minute. However, Truth deliberately shifted blame to the Sangheili and stated that the Sangheili's greatest warriors had ultimately failed in their charge to protect the High Prophets. The Honor Guards of the Covenant were decommissioned, and the Jiralhanae took over as the guardians of the Prophet hierarchy, a political move that infuriated the Sangheili and drove an even deeper rift between the Jiralhanae and the Sangheili, who were already mortal enemies.

   Sentinel Wall
   , a large underground Forerunner complex heavily defended by Sentinels,
   Sentinel Majors
   , and even
   Enforcers
   . Numbers of Jiralhanae, Kig-Yar, and Unggoy had already attempted to penetrate the Sentinel Wall, with pockets scattered all over the facility, all being overwhelmed by Sentinel defenders. However, the Arbiter was air-dropped by
   Tartarus
   's Phantom at the periphery of the wall in the beginning phase of a Covenant offensive to deactivate the Containment Shield, enter the Library, and seize the Sacred Icon.
  </p>
  <p key="6629ca5e-9b5b-4fc5-8172-12f122678fba">
   After battling through the forward section of the Sentinel Wall and moving even deeper through the facility, the Arbiter was able to destroy an Enforcer, and disengage the plug locks of the generator, and then physically disengage the generator out of its "cradle," powering off the Containment Shield. While the shield had been disengaged, the path to the Library was far from clear. There was a rampant Flood infestation: the second half of the Sentinel Wall was heavily saturated with Flood, and there were icy canyons heavily entrenched by Flood battling against outnumbered Sentinel defenders that lay between the perimeter of the Containment Shield and the Library, which was accessible only by an underground gondola.
  </p>
  <p key="301754ed-4cee-4dbd-a8cc-ae89fc37bfd3">
   Tartarus attempted to pick up the Arbiter and move directly to the Library, but his Phantom was engaged by an Enforcer, forcing the Arbiter to battle through the warring Flood and Sentinels that resided in the Flood-Infested Wall
   by himself. However, the Arbiter was not alone - the UNSC had dispatched a squad of Marines to also fight through the facility, but they were overwhelmed by the Flood, leaving a trail of crumpled bodies throughout the facility and fueling the Flood's ever-growing army. The Covenant apparently sent a small team of three Special Operations Sangheili to clear out the lower levels of the complex, but these too were killed. Finally, the Arbiter jumped down a series of plummeting vertical tunnels, exiting from the Sentinel Wall and entering the battle-torn icy plains of the
   Quarantine Zone

   The Arbiter met with three of the Sangheili just outside of the Sentinel Wall, and together, they defended a makeshift Firebase from the Flood before pushing inwards, where the Special Operations Commander had landed and established a small outpost, complete with turrets and the gravity lift tower, where the Special Operations force held out against waves of Flood attacks from the cliffs before they were reinforced by a pair of Phantoms that dropped off a
   Spectre

Despite the prowess of the Special Operations Sangheili and the Arbiter, the UNSC were swifter to advance through the Quarantine Zone - the

   The small Covenant task force was forced to debark from its vehicles as they navigated the wreckage of one of the Sentinel Constructor Factories, although just beyond the wreckage they were met by another Covenant Phantom, this one dropping off a Spectre manned by Rtas 'Vadumee himself and another Special Operations Sangheili. As they progressed through the last series of snowy plains and neared the Library, they were met with increasingly heavy resistance. The Sentinels were in much larger force, while a large number of Flood-infested humans savagely held a barricade against the Library, using crates, turrets, and heavy weapons to prevent anyone from gaining entrance to the Library and retrieving the Index - the use of which would lead to the extermination of all sentient life, as well as the Flood.

   However, a small UNSC Marine force led by Miranda Keyes and Avery J. Johnson was able to slip through, and, in the end, the Arbiter, Rtas 'Vadumee, and half a dozen Special Operations Sangheili were able to slip into the periphery of the Library. There were a pair of
   gondolas
   that, when activated, automatically brought their passengers into the upper tiers of the Library, where the Index was kept. While the UNSC was first able to seize a gondola, the Covenant were close behind. However, when the Flood began to screech, alerting the Covenant that they were in full force in the bowels of the Library, Rtas 'Vadumee took a pair of Special Operations Sangheili, holding them at the entrance to the gondolas to defend the rest from the Flood as the Arbiter took four Special Operations Sangheili on the second gondola, trailing behind the UNSC-held one.

  <p key="52d7dd8d-55c9-4713-8edc-7a96bf8780c1">
   The gondola ride, however, was harrowing. The Flood attacked from all sides, assailing both the UNSC troops as well as the Arbiter and his quartet of Special Operations Sangheili. Tartarus, in his Phantom, attempted to provide cover fire for the Arbiter, using the three plasma cannons of his dropship to burn off any Flood on the upper levels of the Arbiter's gondola, but later, Tartarus chased after the UNSC-held gondola.

   With the Library cleared of hostiles, the Arbiter demanded to have the Index, as he was personally ordered by the Prophet of Truth to secure it for the Covenant. However, unbeknownst to him, he had been betrayed by the Prophets, as had the entire Sangheili race. The Prophets had named the Jiralhanae their new champions, a race both heavily militarized, and unquestionably loyal to them and their Great Journey.

   This event turned out to be a mixed blessing for UNSC forces at the Library.

   , where the Prophets of Truth and Mercy reassured the Covenant that the Sacred Icon was secure. Before SPARTAN-117 could kill both Prophets, the doors were locked and waves of
   Jiralhanae Honor Guardsman
   , Minor Jiralhanae, and Unggoy entered in an attempt to kill the Demon. Cortana managed to unlock the portals, and SPARTAN-117 began his pursuit of Truth. Shortly thereafter, Cortana picked up the IFF transponder signals of surviving UNSC Marines - prisoners of the Covenant being kept in two brigs in a multitiered detention block.

   Cortana managed to reverse a central gravity lift, allowing SPARTAN-117 to enter the detention block.

   What had begun as a political, "changing of hats" within the Covenant quickly escalated into all-out war. The Covenant splintered in the minutes after SPARTAN-117 emancipated the captive Marines. The Prophet of Truth, in three sentences over the loudspeakers of

The Sangheili, seething in hatred against the Jiralhanae who had assassinated their entire ruling Council, had finally had enough. The Sangheili burst into all-out warfare on both on

  <p key="943ed379-40c4-4f5f-a4ce-eab3688c1708">
   Truth's transmissions, however, allowed Cortana to triangulate his position and direct SPARTAN-117 and his Marines in their hunt for the Prophet. The Covenant attempted to stop Cortana, but were unable to prevent her from accessing their systems. As SPARTAN-117 and the Marines reached the

   Mausoleum of the Arbiter

   Sangheili Ultra

   Sangheili High Councilors
   , who had been gathered in the Control Room of Installation 05 for the consecration of the Sacred Icon before the Halos were fired. While most of the Sangheili High Councilors were murdered in cold blood, a small number were taken prisoner by the Jiralhanae. The rest of the Covenant garrison, however, was not so fortunate. A

Tartarus debarked from his own Phantom onto the Control Room, with Keyes and the Index in his grip. The other Phantom diverged, however, and by unknown means, the three Marines freed themselves from their Phantom aboard the docking platform. Avery J. Johnson was able to seize control of the docked Scarab while the other Marines fought off a large number of Jiralhanae Captains with

   However, there was soon a reorganized resistance movement: the Gravemind teleported the Arbiter to a high cliff south of the Control Room, and gave him an objective: to prevent Tartarus from using the Sacred Icon and activating Halo, which would not result in the promised sublimation of the Prophets, but only death and destruction on a galactic scale. The Arbiter witnessed the murders of a handful of Sangheili from afar at the hands of the Jiralhanae, but was able to push forward against a number of patrolling Jiralhanae. Taking command of the scattered surviving soldiers, the Arbiter swore vengeance against the Jiralhanae for the murders of their brothers. The small unit wasted little time, unpinning small groups of scattered loyal Unggoy and killing dozens of Jiralhanae, Kig-Yar, and Yanme'e. Taking their enemies off guard, the Arbiter was able to commandeer a number of Ghosts which proved invaluable throughout the Separatist advance.

  <p key="ae55b967-e0ab-49c3-a7e4-01c6909d9caa">
   The Loyalists attempted to set a trap for the advancing Arbiter and his allies, laying a large number of exploding weapons canisters to block a narrow stretch of the canyon. Even this measure was unsuccessful as the Separatists pushed towards a Jiralhanae weapons depot. The Separatists charged the depot, which was holed in a large Forerunner facility. The defenses were formidable, including heavily armored Wraith plasma tanks and many veteran soldiers. After securing the first half of the camp, the Arbiter moved into the depot itself, where the Jiralhanae had aggregated a large number of Covenant and UNSC weapons alike, including
   M41 Rocket Launchers
   ,
   M90 Shotguns

  <p key="74d518ee-569d-44b1-b415-91a2c64fb794">
   As the Arbiter continued towards the second half of the encampment, the Loyalists became increasingly desperate, sending a group of reinforcements, including Ghost vehicles from another base, the
   Bastion of the Jiralhanae
   . This was ultimately unsuccessful, and the Arbiter was able to advance to meet more friendly units, including Rtas 'Vadumee, who learned from the Arbiter of the Sangheili High Councilors' murder. Rtas 'Vadumee indicated that Tartarus was within the Control Room, and would soon be activating the Halos. However, the doors to the Control Room were nearly completely impenetrable. Only a

  <p key="2169dda7-e622-49dc-83fa-ce039d0e5f7b">
   While Rtas 'Vadumee advanced forward in a Wraith tank, the Arbiter and his surviving warriors secured an entrance into the base. The Arbiter quickly turned the tables on the forces within by freeing a number of Sangheili soldiers being held prisoner. They wasted little time in exacting vengeance upon their captors. Rtas 'Vadumee declared he would remain behind to cover the Arbiter's advance, preventing any flanking attack. Accomplishing this objective, he announced that he would retake the captured Separatist battlecruiser responsible for deploying enemy reinforcements.
  </p>
  <p key="eded8a09-44d1-4b3f-8bbf-9e5a3dac4012">
   The Arbiter, followed by his ad-hoc unit of liberated Mgalekgolo and Sangheili, was able to kill the Jiralhanae Captains guarding the platform, freeing two UNSC Marines (
   Marcus Banks
   and
   Marcus Stacker
   ) in the process. However, Sergeant Johnson still had command of the Scarab, and aimed its main cannon directly at the Arbiter. In a rare show of inter-species goodwill, Johnson offered the Arbiter a deal. It was in the interest of both the UNSC and the Separatists to prevent Tartarus from using the Index to activate the Halo array. Johnson quickly drafted a plan: He would pilot the walker, while the Arbiter escorted him in a Banshee. Together, they would breach the Control Room and prevent the firing of Installation 05. Though it was a small moment in a vast war, this incident was the first time Sangheili and UNSC personnel officially launched a joint attack on their now common enemy: the Covenant Loyalists.
  </p>
  <p key="94a7e651-d92d-48e2-af26-1603a6d7fe37">
   A formidable defensive line awaited the unlikely allies. No less than five Wraith tanks and two Spectres were stationed to prevent the Scarab's passage, with an additional four plasma turrets mounted on the cliffs. In a drastic miscalculation, not only did the plasma munitions of the Loyalist vehicles do no noticeable damage to the heavily armored Scarab, Sergeant Johnson was able to crush opposing enemy armor outright. The Loyalists, acting out of desperation, sortied an airstrike against the Scarab. It ultimately failed to cause any damage to the walker, and the surviving flyers were quickly shot down by the Arbiter's Banshee.

   Shortly afterwards, the Scarab arrived before the Control Room and melted through the armored doors with direct cannon fire. The Arbiter then fought his way through large numbers of Jiralhanae Captains and Jiralhanae Honor Guards. Despite reinforcements, the highly ranked Jiralhanae were unable to check his advance, and the Arbiter continued down an arched corridor before confronting Tartarus in the central control room.
  </p>
  <p key="cce464bd-3d77-4050-9842-343330fa9868">
   Tartarus had been trying to force his prisoner, Miranda Keyes, to place the Sacred Icon into its receptacle on a holographic control panel in the massive central control chamber of the Control Room. Keyes, even under great pain, refused to do so, enraging the Jiralhanae chieftain. When the Arbiter arrived, he demanded that Tartarus put her down, and attempted to reason with Tartarus, urging him that the Prophets had in fact betrayed them all. 343 Guilty Spark, who himself was a prisoner of Tartarus, confirmed the Arbiter's arguments. Unswayed, Tartarus lost all patience. Clutching the Sacred Icon and forcing Miranda Keyes to put it into its receptacle, he began the activation of Installation 05. Behind their platform, a massive Forerunner multitiered construct began to open up: a three-storied structure, which at its center, boasted a brilliant gravitic column. Halo had begun its firing process.
  </p>
  <p key="0a943b2e-aa7f-4c51-9516-04599fd9a90e">
   Miranda jumped out of the way of the imminent firefight as the Arbiter, Sergeant Johnson, and a small cluster of recently arrived Zealots and Sangheili High Councilors charged at Tartarus and his Sangheili guard. Almost immediately, the four captains were slain, and Tartarus was forced back to the recently unveiled three-story structure. When the Arbiter and his allied Zealots and Sangheili High Councilors pursued, they found to their dismay that Tartarus was protected by a nearly impenetrable energy shield. While the Zealots and Sangheili High Councilors drew their Energy Swords and charged, Tartarus openly mocked them, allowing them several blows before drawing his massive Gravity Hammer, the Fist of Rukt, and sending them to their deaths with a single blow.
  </p>
  <p key="dcb3604b-819c-46f8-9d4f-bd456e638faf">
   343 Guilty Spark announced that the installation was priming to fire. With time running out, Sergeant Johnson found that he could overload Tartarus' shields for a brief time with three successive bursts from his beam rifle. The Arbiter soon developed a tactic. He would wait for Johnson to lower Tartarus' shields with his beam rifle shots, and then rush in and attack Tartarus while his shields were down. After a long, protracted fight, the Arbiter was able to fire a finishing blow to Tartarus, ending the reign of the chieftain of the Jiralhanae.
  </p>
  <p key="339af856-2589-47bf-99c9-3ef52c3d363f">
   Miranda Keyes immediately leapt to action after Tartarus died, snatching the Index triumphantly from the control panel. Despite the fact that Installation 05 was primed to fire, because of Miranda's quick actions, the removal of the Index only triggered a partial firing, one that was inconsequential and led to the loss of no life whatsoever.

  <p key="1305cbb5-ebdf-4472-925d-79c584eda352">
   However, 343 Guilty Spark warned that the threat of the Halo arrays was not over: because of the partial activation of Installation 05, the other six remaining installations were set onto standby mode. Each was primed, and ready to fire upon command from a central Forerunner installation: the

   The Battle of Installation 05 was an extremely costly battle with significant political-military consequences for the Covenant and remarkable ramifications for all sentient life in the galaxy. Thousands of Covenant forces were killed during SPARTAN-117's mission to kill the Prophet of Regret, the race to acquire the Index from the Control Room, and the remarkable ground and orbital battles that took place on Installation 05,

   at the hands of the Flood. The Prophet of Truth held the ultimate power now, with several Minor Prophets, completely re-shifting the political dynamics of the Covenant. The Jiralhanae now held reign over the majority of the Covenant military, bringing their innate tenaciousness and ferocity to the front lines, quite unlike the more methodical Sangheili. The Jiralhanae also assumed more lower-level Covenant military authority, now replacing the Sangheili as the leaders of field squads and teams. The Jiralhanae also introduced a unique set of weaponry into the Covenant's field arsenals. The Covenant fleet was believed to have lost the majority of its technical proficiency without the technical knowledge of the Sangheili and their allies.
   This was further compounded by the near extinction of the entire San'Shyuum race, who maintained a near total monopoly of reverse-engineered Forerunner technology.

   It was indicated that all of the other Flood controlled ships were destroyed when, upon landing on Earth, an Sangheili informed the Arbiter that the Sangheili's fleet had taken care of all of the Flood controlled ships, except for that one which had managed to break through and jump to Earth. It can be inferred that the Flood controlled ships were ultimately all destroyed except the one that jumped to Earth and High Charity which was later destroyed by John-117 in the
   Battle of Installation 00
   . Cortana was left to the clutches of the Gravemind. It was later shown that she answered a few questions to buy herself some time and used the opportunity to help find a way to destroy the Flood. She would later be rescued by John-117, who would then destroy High Charity during the
   Raid on High Charity

   John-117 was aboard Truth's Forerunner dreadnought, which managed to reach Earth unharmed and landed in Africa, near the Portal to the Ark, about two weeks after its departure from

   Militarily, SPARTAN-117 was once again able to lead a successful guerrilla battle against both factions of the Covenant on the surface of Delta Halo, and later within High Charity itself. The Sangheili and Jiralhanae defense fleets devastated each other, sparking multiple battles all across Covenant space. Although Loyalist forces remained numerically superior for the remainder of the war, they were now forced to split their attention between human and sangheili targets.

   Politically, the union which had once united seven races had been shattered along sectarian lines. The Sangheili led Separatists eventually allied themselves with the UNSC, bolstering the allied fleets as well as contributing their greatest remaining warriors. Moreover, the infection of High Charity was a catastrophic loss for the entire San'Shyuum people. It is estimated that less than a thousand of their race remained alive by the conclusion of the war, and only those individuals stationed away from the battle itself. This in turn left the other races of the Covenant in a state of decay, and possible collapse, as their combined technology was imitative rather than innovated.

   In many ways, the Battle of Installation 05 was the true turning point in the Human-Covenant war. The UNSC was able to successfully assassinate a High Prophet and prevent the Halo arrays from firing, at the cost of a single Frigate and most of its crew. The Prophets had considered replacing the Sangheili with the more easily manipulated Jiralhanae for some time, yet the death of Regret in many ways forced Truth's hand at a critical moment during the Covenant's campaign against humanity. While the Covenant maintained sufficient military forces to defeat the UNSC and their Separatist allies, it had lost the three pillars of its own civilization: the San'Shyuum's secrets of Forerunner technology, the Sangheili' military leadership, and its capital city of High Charity. Losses were high on both sides of the conflict, yet for the Covenant, it was strategically a deathblow the Empire would never recover from.
