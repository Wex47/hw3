   to take it.
   While some of the ODSTs were able to attack the butte with supporting air support, some were led into what was known as a back door. After elimination of all immediate threats, this team entered the back door and took a lift to regroup with the rest of the squad. It is unknown how much of a defense Silva put into guarding this pass, but apparently, the Covenant was unable to use this backdoor to gain access to the base.

   Despite now having this strategic foothold, Silva still had a great deal of problems. The ODSTs were equipped with enough food and supplies to last 2 weeks. However, that was not the case with the 63 crewmen that John-117 was able to rescue. Also, the dropships were running low on fuel and the base was not adequately prepared for a massive counter-attack. Therefore, Silva ordered McKay to go to the downed Autumn and recover whatever supplies that she could. The raid was a success and only a minimum of UNSC casualties occurred, while several

   dropships were destroyed. The Marines and ODSTs were able to secure a sufficient amount of fuel, food, and munitions. Also, two 50mm turrets were recovered, a contingent of LRV Warthogs, and 4 Scorpion Tanks. Unfortunately, there was no ammo or rockets for the Pelicans, limiting their usage to transport only. Some of the supplies, LRVs, and Marines were lost in the return trip due to Covenant resistance.

   The base was attacked twice while during the time the UNSC was on Installation 04. This attack was led by Major Silva and his battalion of ODSTs in an attempt to wrench the protective butte from the hands of the Covenant in order to establish a place where the UNSC personnel could regroup. Silva ordered Lt. McKay to lead an assault through a pass that hopefully led to the top of the base. As McKay and her company began their climb, the Covenant launched a preemptive strike against Silva. Wellsley informed him that the attack would consisted of an estimated 100 Ghosts.

   With half of his forces committed elsewhere, Silva ordered Companies A and D to group into an
   infantry square
   . This, and the natural terrain, gave the ODSTs a better chance of survival against the Ghosts' fixed weapons. At the start of the battle, the Covenant fought very poorly, with several Ghosts firing upon each other or colliding in their haste to score a kill. Eventually, a Field Commander took charge and ordered all of the vehicles to turn counter-clockwise and then to attack the lowest pit in the square. Human casualties increased and the square started to break. Silva responded by reinforcing the pit, bringing up heavy weapons to deal with the vehicles, as well as having his sniper team concentrate fire on the Field Commander. As an apparent afterthought, Banshees were thrown late into the fight and were quickly eliminated by M19 launchers. Finally, with the Field Commander dead, and a 50% casualty rate, the attackers retreated, some carrying extra riders on their Ghost. From that attack, 23 were KIA, 6 were critically injured, and 10 were WIA. Finally Silva could get the Pelicans to attack the butte and give McKay some support.

   Meanwhile, McKay was making her way up the butte. She had already lost some of her soldiers, one to a plasma grenade, but she was making a good deal of progress. At last she made it to a back door into the structure. She fired an M19 rocket into it, which struck some sort of ammo dump, clearing the room of all hostiles in the process. She and her remaining company entered to find an elevator to the surface of the butte. As a result of the battle, the UNSC managed to secure location for a base of operations.

   Xaing Cho
   , gave the AI Wellsley control of the 50mm autocannons, with which he was able to eliminate 1 Spirit dropship. The remaining dropships released their troops further away from the base and attempted to assault it thus. Snipers expertly inflicted heavy casualties on the disembarking troops. Two of the recovered Scorpion Tanks had been entrenched and were able to cut down much of the onslaught, including the
   Field Master
   . With their leader dead, lesser Sangheili attempted to assume command with little success. In the end, all remaining Covenant were either captured, killed, or forced to retreat.
   Yayap
   and Zamamee were able to survive by stealing one of the Banshees that the Marines had been able to salvage.

    Wellsley suggested it be named 'Gawilghur',
    referencing a fortress Sir Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, laid siege to in India. Major Silva shot down Wellsley's request and stated that most of the Marines wouldn't be able to pronounce the name right.
