They measured their advancements in

   At some point during their development, the Flood was discovered to have entered the galaxy from an undetermined extragalactic point of origin, contesting the Forerunners for control of the entire galaxy. While the Flood sought to assimilate all sentient life, the Forerunners attempted to defend against the Flood threat using several measures to both directly combat them as well as carry out research in regards to their capabilities. As time progressed, they also began to develop and create super-weaponry, specifically the
   Halo Array

As a method of countering the total elimination of all sentient species outside the Forerunner's shielded planets (the result of triggering the Halos), the Forerunners began indexing and protecting them from Flood assimilation out of emotional, habitual, and ideologically-motivated actions driven by their

   The Flood entered the Milky Way galaxy at approximately 98,379 BCE, and initially caught the Forerunner military by surprise at
   G617 g1
   using captured non-military vessels to penetrate local Forerunner naval blockades to descend and land upon Forerunner-colonized worlds, overrunning local defenses and converting billions of Forerunners per world with hundreds of millions of Flood forms within a few years. Eventually, Forerunner fleets were forced to commence orbital bombardment on Flood-infested worlds to prevent the Flood's spread to other planets.

   Following the 300 years of devastating warfare between the Flood and the Forerunners, the highest levels and tiers of the
   Forerunner Fleet Command
   began to realize that Forerunner species extinction was plausible at the Flood's discretion as so many Forerunners had fallen victim to the Flood. As the spread of the Flood continued, planetary self-bombardment after Flood infestation turned into complete system-wide destruction by detonating planetary system stars after a large Flood presence was detected in a Forerunner system. Forerunner military forces were ordered to don heavy armor and other personnel was ordered into protective stasis. Flood was taken into M-type Forerunner installations and studied in an effort to find yet another countermeasure.

   Hundreds of other unsuccessful methods

However,

   During the stalemate, the Flood was exponentially growing and readying for an attack, and eventually, they assaulted the Forerunner core systems with thousands of Flood-controlled superluminal vessels. While three Forerunner naval groups, the Emergency Circumstance Fleet, Security Fleet, and Suppression Fleet, were recalled to defend against the Flood attack, 05-032 Mendicant Bias became

   Advance Survey Team-Alpha

   Earth
   at the edge of the Milky Way galaxy. The Librarian journeyed there to acquire a sufficient human population to replace that which was composed by the Ur-Didact on Omega Halo, his attempt to bolster his forces of Promethean Knight warframes. The Librarian also enacted a clever plan to buy time for the Iso-Didact to activate the Halo Array from Installation 00, and broadcasted to all Forerunner vessels, including those controlled by the Flood, that she had discovered the cure for the Flood upon the Earth. She sent her new index of humans back to Installation 00 with her newly appointed successor, staying behind to oversee the creation of a

The Forerunners saw a unique potential in the human species, creating a "Conservation Measure" for the protection of humanity, protecting them with the Ark. The Librarian lived to see that her plan had succeeded, that she had successfully led the Flood advance to Earth with her misinformation, as thousands of Precursor star roads closed in on Earth.

The Iso-Didact was out of time and activated the Halo Array. 05-032 Mendicant Bias attempted to prevent the Didact from doing as so but was stopped by a loyal Forerunner artificial intelligence,
