   Halo Alpha maintains a strict policy on how media should be documented, entirely based on whether the media is canon or not. Only
   cited
   information from canon sources should be added to articles on in-universe (i.e. canonical) subjects. Official media that is considered non-canon is still afforded pages documenting it and its content, but these must be marked with the

   , which is contributed to by a multitude of different writers, inconsistencies and errors are almost inevitable and indeed,
   some
   have already emerged. In such cases, it is important to distinguish which of the conflicting sources is considered to be correct and which source is mistaken. For this purpose, Halo Alpha's 'Canon Hierarchy' has been devised. Canonical media which is higher up in the hierarchy takes precedent over media lower than it if a conflict arises. It is important to note that the position of a piece of media on the hierarchy does not make it 'superior' or 'inferior' canon; all pieces of canonical media are just that - canon - but some simply overrule others in the rare case that inconsistencies occur.

    </b>
    EU media is often written by external writers who are less familiar with the universe than the games' writers. Hence, EU media is slightly more likely to contain errors than the games, and so is below games in the hierarchy. That said, such media is created under the direct oversight of the writers, and so is still considered an excellent source of canon information. This category includes any officially-licensed media that is set in or based around the universe such as the novels, comics, animated films, live-action movies and encyclopedic works based on the fiction.

     media:
    </b>
    Supplementary media is anything that is created to provide insight on the franchise, or an entry in the franchise, rather than be a standalone addition to it. This includes game manuals, game guide books, art books and behind-the-scenes documentaries. Such media rarely contains anything pertinent to the fictional universe, but where it does, it is considered canon.

    Marketing material is canonical, but also is often created during the development of the games, and so is based off of content that is not finalised.

It is important to note that some events depicted in marketing materials are given in-universe explanations, such as
