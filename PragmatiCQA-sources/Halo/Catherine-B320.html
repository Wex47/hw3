   2530

   Beta Company
   early on. She would later be taken out of Beta Company by
   Kurt-051
   and
   Franklin Mendez
   after
   Operation: CARTWHEEL
   , and shortly before
   Operation: TORPEDO
   would commence.
   Some time later she would be assigned to the newly formed
   Noble Team

   Kat, along with
   Carter-A259
   , is one of only two survivors from the original Noble Team. As a result, she shares a close bond with Carter. She is Noble Team's second-in-command, and described as being fiercely loyal to Carter and the rest of the team.

   On April 22, 2552, Kat planned an

   to destroy a

   The operation was successful, but cost
   Thom-A293
   his life, and Kat her right arm, which has since been replaced by a
   robotic prosthetic
   .
   Kat clearly has no problem working with her prosthetic arm, as she moves it just as naturally as her previous biological one, even continuing to hold her pistol in her dominant right hand.

   The Spartans of Noble Team participated in an operation to investigate a communications blackout at the Visegrád Relay, a mission which led to the first confrontation with Covenant forces on
   Reach
   .
   During the operation, Kat recovered a data module containing
   Laszlo Sorvad
   's "latchkey discovery" from the Relay's console and revealed that the Covenant had successfully deployed their forces on Reach.
   The discovery led the team to
   Sword Base
   , currently under siege by Covenant forces and their
   corvette
   .
   Kat and Noble Six engaged the Covenant forces on foot and repelled them off the site and the
   airbase
   .

   Intelligence gathered from Noble Six and
   Jun-A266
   's reconnaissance mission lead to a large-scale UNSC assault on a Covenant-occupied site.
   Kat and Noble Six engaged Covenant forces on the groundside while other members of Noble Team provided aerial support. Noble Six assisted Kat in reconnaissance of the Covenant-occupied site, destroying
   multiple aerial defenses
   and unveiling a large Covenant installation code-named
   Spire One

   Battle of Viery
   prompted Carter and Kat to reassess the situation. Recognizing the presence of the Supercarrier as a large threat, Kat suggested to Noble Team to reconfigure a

   into a makeshift slipspace bomb, which would destroy the supercarrier immediately.
   Carter, along with Kat,
   Jorge-052
   and
   SPARTAN-B312
   , helped UNSC ground forces repel Covenant invaders from a UNSC base, which housed the
   Sabre Program Launch/Research Range
   . Noble Team was separated from this point, with Jorge and Noble Six participating in
   Operation: UPPER CUT
   while the rest focused on groundside operations.

  <p key="05b8e42a-b173-485e-a360-e04bda08e6a7">
   At some point during the Fall of Reach, Kat and the remaining members of Noble Team assisted the UNSC in repelling the Covenant from civilian population centres. They reunited with Noble Six in
   New Alexandria
   and helped in the neutralization of Covenant communication jammers and the evacuation of ONI personnel.
   Soon, Noble Team was hailed by its supervisor,
   Colonel
   Urban Holland
   , and was ordered to destroy 'Sword Base'. The team was forced to enter a radiation bunker to shield them from the Covenant's glassing of New Alexandria. As Noble Team exited the elevator and ran towards the bunker, a
   Sangheili Field Marshal
   in a
   Phantom
   overhead, shot her in the back of the head with a
   needle rifle
   , killing her instantly.

   Catherine was described as an inspired tactician and an exemplary combatant, but also a brilliant cryptanalyst and a hacker; allegedly, there has not been a system yet that she had been unable to crack. According to
   Colonel
   Urban Holland
   , she had a habit of occasionally investigating classified Intel more than her superiors would have liked her to. Her ability to acquire and digest information has been described as "supernatural"; more than once, she had been able to read a situation, working with information many others would find overly limited.

   Like Carter, Kat blamed herself for
   Thom-A293
   's death while it was apparent that neither was responsible; according to Colonel Urban Holland, Thom died because when he went into the

    As shown in an early production note, Kat was originally intended to have been born in 2529, and was supposed to have been conscripted as a part of
    Alpha Company
    . In this version, she and Carter were the last remaining members of a SPARTAN-III team known as "Blue Team" (not to be confused with the
    SPARTAN-II unit
