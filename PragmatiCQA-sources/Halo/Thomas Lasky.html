   Thomas Lasky was born on August 15,
   2510
   to
   Colonel
   Audrey Lasky
   , his mother, in
   Mare Erythraeum
   ,
   Mars
   . Growing up on Mars, Thomas became very close to his older brother
   Cadmon
   .
   Tom also developed a close relationship to
   Petra Janecek
   .
   He began his officer training as a freshman cadet in
   Corbulo Academy of Military Science
   on
   Circinius IV
   sometime preceding spring
   2526
   , months after

   began; this development was kept from the students and much of the staff at Corbulo however. Organized into
   Hastati Squad
   , a freshman unit in the class of 2529, Lasky originally began as a team leader during field exercises.
  </p>
  <p key="273d8bb7-3eb4-4264-bd3b-a405f92358e2">
   During his time in the school, he regularly exchanged video messages with his brother
   Cadmon
   , former student of Corbulo Academy who went on to serve as an
   <a href="Orbital Drop Shock Trooper.html" key="d69088a1-73c1-4985-b134-493614e75ed6" title="Orbital Drop Shock Trooper">
    ODST
   </a>
   fighting on the front lines in the war against the
   Insurrectionists
   . Enjoying a close friendship with his brother, Thomas was deeply struck when Cadmon was killed in a battle with Insurrectionists, starting to express doubt about the sensibility of the UNSC waging war against the Insurrectionists and viewing his training with cynicism, failing to take the exercises seriously anymore. As there were no remains their mother felt Thomas should not leave school to attend his brother's funeral. Meanwhile, Lasky continued to replay his brother's messages in his spare time.
  </p>
  <p key="547d16b7-62e7-4ec1-bdb7-f442b3007577">
   Lasky's reputation suffered at his constant disregard for the orders of his superiors and displaying a lack of proficient knowledge of infantry tactics. He was subsequently relieved of his duties as team leader, which then fell to squadmate
   Walter Vickers
   . Despite this, he persistently ignored orders and continued to cause Hastati to receive low combat scores, resulting in him being shunned by the rest of the squad. Worse, his health declined rapidly during the school's mandatory acclimation to
   cryosleep
   ; he suffered from large blisters and a persistent cough.
  </p>
  <p key="048cd59a-d986-41fb-8074-42eb91038b3e">
   His classmates were unrelenting in their provocation of Thomas, affirming their distaste for the freshman who did not live up to the example set by his brother Cadmon. Days prior to the end of the 2525-2526 school year, Lasky and Vickers were singled out by their squad leader
   April Orenski
   resulting in disciplinary physical training for them, and the remainder of Hastati. Frustrated by the verbal and physical harassment he received from his squadmate, Lasky assaulted Vickers in the school's mess hall. Senior cadets and underclassmen alike continued to encourage the altercation, in which the two were performing hand-to-hand combat tactics taught at the academy. Lasky mildly injured Vickers and only ended his violent strife to acknowledge
   Colonel Mehaffey's
   presence. The professor took advantage of this quarrel in her mentorship of Lasky, hoping he would embrace the warrior culture of the UNSC and inspire him to become a better leader.
  </p>
  <p key="4f13f426-1cac-4ba8-85d9-00855cc624d9">
   Mehaffey's efforts dawned on the young cadet and he volunteered to lead Hastati moments prior to the start of their final combat exercise, a contest of
   capture the flag
   . While waiting for Zuma Squad to approach their flag's location, Lasky had organized Hastati into cover in a tight formation adjacent their flag, a seemingly ill-tactical maneuver. Lasky ordered his men to remove their helmets as they contained IFF transponders that were detectable by the enemy's motion sensors. With Zuma converging on Hastati's flag, Lasky positioned his squad in a formation reminiscent of the
   pincer movement
   , a tactic utilized to great effect by
   Hannibal
   at
   Cannae
   in 216 BCE, taught to the freshman cadets only a day before the exercise by Col. Mehaffey. The enemy soon realized that Lasky had funneled them into a trap and they were swiftly dispatched by two sections of Hastati cadets. The two Hastati elements continued to press in on Zuma's flag with ease, eliminating or capturing all enemy cadets, suffering no casualties of their own in the process. An emboldened Lasky, charging towards Zuma's flag, finally succumbed to his ailing health and collapsed meters away from completing the objective.
  </p>
  <p key="f5229472-f18e-4e29-ace8-9d917934e169">
   Examination by Doctor Hughes of the Academy's medical staff revealed that Lasky's condition was an allergic reaction to the cryo drug
   cytoprethaline
   . As cytoprethaline is vital for cryo-sleep to prevent damage to cells, Lasky was judged to be unfit for UNSC service and was to be medically discharged.

   , completely overwhelming the Academy's Marine guard and forcing Lasky and his fellow cadets into front line service.
   Much of Hastati Squad was killed early on in the action, with Lasky, Orenski, and
   Michael Sullivan

   Lasky had Halsey returned to the brig while Fireteam Majestic was sent after their missing teammate. However, Halsey used an AI override code on Roland to force him to follow her commands, gather everything the UNSC had on the Librarian, and directly contact Jul.

   who was not only an old friend of Lasky's, but was also the intended contact of their mission. As Lasky and Petra were catching up, Lasky asked her for her help in discovering which mole in the UNSC divulged the location of the peace negotiations. Petra agreed to help in return for information on John 117’s current status and whereabouts.

   Known for his renegade attitude as an "
   innie
   sympathizer," during his youth, Thomas was shunned universally by squadmates and other classmates alike. Lasky was not hesitant whatsoever to express his views on the ongoing conflict with the colonies, even with the ardent stance on the conquering of the rebel effort by the majority of Corbulo Academy's staff and cadet corps. As a result, many believed that Thomas would not live up to the level of excellency set by his brother Cadmon, by then a marine junior officer in the

   , nor the expectations of his estranged mother. Few expected him to even graduate from the academy. At the conclusion of his freshman year from 2525 to 2526, however, lingering doubts about his competency as a future officer were alleviated. Concern over his constant displays of pacifism and his sympathy towards the Insurrectionist cause fell aside as he successfully led his squad into combat using tactics that overwhelmed the enemy, causing them to peacefully capitulate. Lasky also has a very high moral standard; when Admiral Osman ordered the execution of Catherine Halsey, he attempted to persuade Commander Sarah Palmer not to commit this action - showing his compassion for members of the UNSC as well as civilians whom he joined the UNSC to protect, not to kill.
