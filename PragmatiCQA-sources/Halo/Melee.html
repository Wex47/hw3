   Melee attacks are stealthy and conserve ammunition. The close-range attack causes damage to the target's bones and tissues, allowing an attacker to injure a target without using ammunition. A melee from behind functions by breaking the target's neck or spine, and is sufficient to kill virtually any enemy in the games, regardless of how much shielding or armor they happen to be wearing (with the exception of Hunters and Flood forms). Also, one melee against a sleeping

   In Campaign, melees are "silent," thus, they don't alert enemies the way gunfire does. If used carefully, players are capable of clearing an entire room without alerting the enemy.

   Melee attacks are commonly used in multiplayer matches, where only a few blows are needed to kill an opponent; they allow one player to kill another without the sound of gunfire revealing their location or the weapons they are carrying. Melees are more efficient when used from behind.

   When wielding a melee weapon, it is possible to lunge at a distant enemy. If a target is close enough that aiming at them turns an attacker's

   red, then the attacker can aim at them and press

   A lunge delays a melee. If an attacker is wielding the Gravity Hammer, they may find a target and approach them. If the attacker aims away from the target, they can swing the hammer the moment their target gets within the "blast radius," killing the victim almost instantly. If, however, the attacker aims

  <p key="8aa27e97-e470-4038-8bd2-fa9a40c263a6">
   By contrast, lunging is extremely helpful when using the Energy Sword, as it lacks splash damage.

   Halo 4 features a more consistent melee; a melee to a player with a certain amount of their shields depleted will result in an instant kill. A popular tactic with automatic weapons is to fire on the target from mid range while closing in on them, then to follow up with a melee - this is usually sufficient to kill the target. The assassination feature from Halo: Reach has carried over, now with many more animations dependant on how the assassination is approached.
