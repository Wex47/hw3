    Brute Chieftains, as fitting their "commander" role, have incredible physical strength and agility - far more so than their lesser brethren. Avoid going into melee combat with a Chieftain, and even when facing off against a War Chieftain, take care not to get hit. However, if you do get yourself in the situation, do not try to melee him or he will quickly deliver a direct blow with the Gravity Hammer, which is a one-hit-kill even on
    Normal
    difficulty. Run away as quickly as possible once you see him trying to get close enough to melee you. Shoot him enough times with one of your weapons, until his Power Armor breaks, then try to shoot his helmet/headdress off so that you can score a

    Another way, though difficult, is to circle around the back of the Chieftain, wait for him to do his backwards melee attack, and again circle round him while he is still turning round to where you used to be. This gives you ample time for an assassination. Believe it or not, this is the best way to kill them: their swing animations are incredibly predictable during

    , and this extends to all hammer-wielding brutes. Note: assassinations ignore Invincibility, making this tactic even more useful.
   </li>
   <li key="8fde9ca4-dc2a-42a6-9a7e-2a8b7899b74d">
    One of the best ways to kill a Chieftain is to charge at them from a distance. They will begin to leap at you; use the time when they are crouching down to leap to get up close to them. When they leap, if done correctly, they over the player's head, giving him or her enough time to perform an assassination.
   </li>
   <li key="0c41b90a-5fa5-4aa6-8773-1bb1f7bada41">
    A hammer-wielding Chieftain will often utilize the Invincibility power-up while charging at you if you're firing and back-pedaling at the same time. However, if the player is able to kill the Chieftain before he activates it, the player can use the Invincibility to great gain.
   </li>
   <li key="0da6d096-5944-4c88-9882-14eef25cff8b">
    Even when Chieftains utilize the Invincibility power-up, an assassination will still kill them.

   <li key="39f524af-a814-4611-975a-39d68885fc71">
    A good way to kill a Chieftain is to use Cloaking and assassinate them. This way you are unharmed, and you can also pick up their Invincibility, since they did not have time to activate it. However, you should be careful not to alert any of the surrounding Brutes. If they know that you are there, even if they cannot see you, the Chieftain will sometimes be able to sense where you are even if you are cloaked and will turn around in your direction, although he does not attack. This will make it harder to get behind him and if you touch him, he will hit you and you will temporarily lose your cloaking, allowing the rest of the Brutes to see and attack you.
   </li>
   <li key="f64e4e0b-4809-49e7-9111-6d512203404d">
    Probably the easiest way to kill a Chieftain is to use a Spartan Laser on him. This will kill the Jiralhanae instantly, allowing you to pick up his Invincibility and, if you want, his Gravity Hammer. It is easier to do this as soon as you see them while they are taunting and growling at you, for on higher difficulties, they will activate their invincibility as the laser hits them, rendering the shot wasted.

   <li key="026b87de-b609-4c61-8ab2-b2761c1299a3">
    When facing a charging Chieftain, jump up as they try to hit you with their hammer and the blow from the hammer will push you away from the Brute, giving you more time to damage him and ultimately kill him as well as recharge your shields. Make sure you're not on an edge or the blast from the hammer could knock you over the edge, killing you.

   <li key="87233517-4099-4849-a717-50feafd9b8c5">
    Incendiary grenades are a good way to kill a Chieftain, although on Legendary, this is not a guaranteed one hit kill, as he can easily activate his Invincibility and negate the effects of your grenade.

   <li key="472153cf-122d-4080-bbb0-3079780a12e4">
    If the Chieftain is alone, you may attempt to lure him into a close range fight and melee him before sidestepping. The Chieftains are surprisingly slow to recover after a melee/hammer attempt, so you can kill them with multiple melee hits by edging around him/jumping over him every time he attempts to melee/hammer you. This is quite risky, however, and is not recommended on higher difficulties.

    Another good way to kill a Chieftain is to dual-wield Spikers, as Chieftains seem to have a vulnerability to the spikes. Enough spikes will also slow down the Chieftain, occasionally stopping the Chieftain's charge and if you pump enough into him, he

    When a Chieftain swings their gravity hammer at you, you can perform a 'gravity jump.' While not an actual move incorporated into the game, this involves jumping moments before the hammer hits, so that you ride the shock wave, usually to a place far away from the chieftain. Skilled players may utilize this to get out of an explosive's blast range, or to get head shots from above.

    Unlike Energy Sword-equipped Elites, who will generally make a beeline for their target without evading enemy fire, Hammer Chieftains will jink back and forth as they charge, making them much more difficult to head shot or stick than their Elite counterparts.

They do, however, have two weakness that the Hunters do not have: the Chieftains can be assassinated whereas the Hunters cannot be, and once their headpiece was removed they were susceptible to Headshots. The latter of these is emulated, however, by the Hunter's vulnerability to shots at its waist.
