   The message would lead viewers to a beekeeper's website that appeared to be hacked at first glance. The frontpage shows a floating counter counting down to specific time, all of which relates to the Alternate reality game. The first countdown ended on July 27, accompanied with the following message, "network throttling will erode." The subsequent countdowns displays "this medium will metastasize" on August 10, and "wide-awake and physical" on August 24. Currently, the countdown is counting down to the day the

   The game begins with the participating viewers to locate all of the payphones (or
   Axons
   as referred by Dana) across the United States. Participants who answered the axons at each countdown would be given a recording of an AI and be asked basic questions about the character. If answered correctly, an audio clip would be released and a number would be added to the counter of the website. The audio clips, when threaded together, formed an audio drama about the characters in the Halo Universe. When the number reached 777, the AI, as played by a voice actor instead of a recording, would begin to interact with the players through the payphones. The AI would question the participants on general subjects such as name and jokes.

Access to these sites would be granted provided that the participants say "The Operator left a message for me," though not all hosts of these sites were aware of the marketing campaign. At each event, participants were given DVDs of the marketing campaign, containing all of the audio files, as well as deleted materials.
