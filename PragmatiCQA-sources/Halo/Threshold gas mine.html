   Threshold
   , the planet around which
   Installation 04

   Hanging from a support superstructure higher in the atmosphere, the mine is shaped somewhat like a grappling hook, with one center shaft and many legs bending down, and inwards it has three tubes extracting gas from Threshold (although only two are operating during the game) the station is divided into five modules: two gas refinement arms (each one with its own cargo hangar), two Laboratory modules for the research of the

   , and the final module is the control section of the mine. Each of these modules can be accessed by catwalks or landing sites (there are no other visible means for access).

  <p key="3db0ebd7-be10-4c44-b953-41167940f9f8">
   The main cable is held in place by three equidistant holds on the top level. Supposedly, the holds could be released by the main control of the station. The inside of the gas mine is a curious mix of forerunner and factory, with dozens of moving energy conveyor belts carrying gas canisters about. There is a large gas storage hold, which is accessed by a large circular
   lift
   . This hold contains hundreds of canisters, most of which contain Flood.

   The gas mine was created by the Forerunners with the sole purpose of mining gas from the atmosphere of Threshold. It operated on a completely automated basis for "untold centuries" with only a handful of

   to maintain the facility.
   It is unclear why the gas was needed, but the gas canisters found in the gas mine could be found on the
   Halos
   , thus explaining why the installations were built around gas giants. It is also possible that the gas mined from facilities similar to these were used for powering the keyships. That would explain why most of High Charity is powered by one of the keyships.

  <p key="1af2216d-3c8d-411c-8040-e506c1ecc89a">
   However, after the Flood was discovered, the Forerunners retrofitted several areas of the gas mine into laboratories to study Flood specimens.
   343 Guilty Spark
   , the future
   Monitor
   of Installation 04, personally oversaw some of these modifications. A few hundred years passed, however, with no successful defense against the Flood. Thus, the Forerunners constructed the Halo Rings.

  <p key="dff077da-95d9-4a6b-9219-6e2e1c7bdb27">
   The gas mine was unaffected by the first activation of the rings and its contained Flood remained intact and untouched for over 100,000 years, until the year
   2552

   discovered Installation 04, they sent the
   Fleet of Particular Justice
   to scout the ring and the system. An artifact retrieval team led by
   Sesa 'Refumee
   and
   Loka 'Bandolee
   , landed on the gas mine attempting to retrieve any useful Forerunner technologies they could find; however, at the conclusion of the
   Battle of Installation 04

   While there, the group encountered 343 Guilty Spark, drifting in space from the remains of Installation 04. Listening to his words and finding out the truth about the Halos and the
   Great Journey

   shed their former armor for the colors of the Elite homeworld
   and began broadcasting their beliefs into space, attracting the attention of other Covenant personnel, including the
   Hierarchs
   . Dubbing his movement heresy, the Hierarchs ordered
   forces led by
   Rtas 'Vadumee
   and the
   Arbiter
   to attack the gas mine and end 'Refumee's movement forever.

  <p key="39c4d058-532e-49b5-bb43-73adb2563315">
   The surprise attack went well; the SpecOps forces were able to infiltrate the facility and pursue the Heretic Leader, even destroying the Heretic Air Force along the way.
   But complications arose when the Flood were released from their restraints by the Heretics,
   and overran the entire facility. The Flood multiplied quickly, infecting and killing most of the Heretic forces, making it difficult for the SpecOps Elites to secure the facility. The Heretic leader locked himself in the inner section of the mine, safe from both the Flood and an approaching maelstrom, but the Arbiter responded by cutting the cables holding the mine up, sending it into free-fall towards Threshold. This forced the Heretic Leader to abandon his hideout and make an attempt to evacuate aboard a Covenant
   Seraph
   fighter. Before he could flee, the Arbiter caught up to him and they fought a heated battle leading to the heretic leader's death. Shortly thereafter,
   Tartarus
   appeared in a
   Phantom
   , and he, the Arbiter, the SpecOps Elites, and 343 Guilty Spark escaped the mine before it fell into Threshold's inner atmosphere, where it was subsequently destroyed.

    According to 343 Guilty Spark, the cables supporting the gas mine, which the Arbiter cut with an
    Energy Sword
    , are actually a fail-safe function to prevent the Flood from escaping the mine, should an outbreak occur.
