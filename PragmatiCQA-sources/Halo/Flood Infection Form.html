   Though they appear small and relatively harmless, a single Flood Infection Form can be responsible for the extinction of an entire species. Their primary function is to gather biomass, and they can achieve this in a variety of ways. 
Any sentient being without shielding or other suitable protection are the most vulnerable. There have been reports of some being able to resist infection (see service records of PVT

   The process of infection begins with host contact. Tentacles protruding from its body penetrate the skin, and attempt direct communication with the host's spinal cord. Once communication is established, a potent attack of the nervous system is commenced. In the vast majority of cases, this kills the host almost instantly. It then rewrites the neural pathways of the victim's brain, forcing a resonant frequency match between the host neural signals and its own. Then, it releases the
   Flood Super Cell
   which overwrites the host DNA and causes rapid mutation.
  </p>
  <p key="fb163b70-3d8d-438d-9f87-df72f6c3c980">
   Once the internal infection process is complete, it begins to morphologically augment the body liquefying organs and redistributing biomass to create large claw-like appendages on the arm from the calcium in osseous tissue. The central mass of the Infection Form will then nest itself within the chest cavity of its host, completing infection of the host. Though complex, this mutagenic process takes seconds. In exceedingly rare cases, such as if the Infection Form has been damaged or is excessively aged, it can complete infection without killing the host. This leaves the host at least partially conscious, but with little to no control over body and mind.
  </p>
  <p key="12fb402a-32bb-4664-b6f4-6c5e8ba04c6d">
   If the infection of a particular sentient being is not possible, that organism will be completely disregarded by Infection Forms. The incompatible body will then be killed and used as biomass as the Flood spreads. An Infection Form may also abandon its host if the body has been heavily damaged.

   This aged version of the Infection Form must have been kept in captivity for far too long, thereby reducing its potential to completely transform its host into a Flood Combat Form.

However, the sheer force of numbers can sometimes deplete a victim's shields, weakening them enough for fellow Flood forms to kill the victim to allow the Infection Form to start the process or infect them while they are still alive.

SMGs are incredibly effective for taking on swarms of Infection Forms with its large magazine size and impressive rate of fire.

   Infection Forms are spawned from bulging, sac-like pods in
   Flood Hives
   , called the
   Flood Growth Pods
   . They are only released if the pods are shot at (although for some gameplay scenes such they will pop under game programming). Unlike the Carrier Form, throwing plasma or incendiary grenades will not destroy the Infection Forms inside.
