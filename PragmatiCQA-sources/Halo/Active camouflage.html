   Though Active Camouflage is quite effective from a distance, it can faintly be seen if an observer is close enough to the wearer. However, it is difficult to spot a camouflaged opponent from a distance using a scoped weapon—actual physical proximity is required to reliably spot a person using Active Camo. It should be noted, though, that Active Camouflage does not mask environmental effects such as footprints, meaning that it is not as effective on soft terrain (such as the snow found in

   The shielding provided by Active Camo can be disrupted if projectiles, such as rockets, bullets, and explosions make contact with it; such a disruption weakens the invisibility effect and temporarily reveals the wearer. The powerup can be disrupted if the wearer fires shots or if the wearer is hit. It also progressively worsens: the longer the wearer fires (or is hit), the more visible they become. Once the disruptions end, however, the wearer quickly regains their invisibility.

   The UNSC has developed various technologies to conceal a soldier or any object from view. The most common form of this technology operates on a different principle than the Covenant active camo, using photo-reactive panels to impersonate the surrounding environment like a chameleon. A device known as the Camouflage cloak can hide the wearer's infrared signature, beside serving as a form of camouflage. However, UNSC camouflage technology is inferior to Covenant active camouflage in many respects.

    Semi-Powered Infiltration armor

   used by the
   Spartan-IIIs
   utilizes photo-reactive panels to conceal the wearer's infrared signature and to blend in with the surrounding environment. When combined with their natural talent and training for stealth, it can be a very effective tool. Some
   Headhunters
   use a prototype camouflage almost identical to the Covenant version, rendering them almost invisible, except that it only lasts 3–5 minutes and other systems have their power drained while it recharged. This feature was tested by

   Active Camouflage technology was later improved and even applied to the Mjolnir armor system. This camouflage is able to function without ablative panels; the active camouflage is generated by a small device attached to the user's back. This technology has its drawbacks however; all sound is muffled while the active camo is in use, and the more the user moves, the more visible they become.
   By 2557 active camouflage no longer muffles the wearer but cannot confuse the enemy as easily.

    UNSC prowlers
   </a>
   use ablative panels or "active camouflage skin" to conceal themselves from view in addition to masking their heat signatures. This camouflage isn't perfect however, and cannot keep up with a constantly changing background such as a gas giant's atmosphere.
   However, more advanced stealth ships were developed, such as an
   Unnamed Stealth Spacecraft
   using a form of cloak "bubble." This technology hasn't yet been observed in widespread use.

   Another form of Active Camouflage is Carbon Nanontube Cloaking used on specialized Pelicans like the
   Tart-cart
   . It is used to fool the eye at a distance. It was considered obsolete by 2553 but was still being used.

   has undergone many major changes. It is now available as an
   Armor Ability
   to both Spartan and Sangheili players. As a side-effect when used, it jams the radar of the player and all other enemy players within 25 meters, disorienting them, but also informing them of the player's nearby presence. It does not affect the radar of allies. The Active Camo also greatly reduces the volume of all sounds for its user, making it difficult to notice a grenade being thrown or a nearby enemy firing a weapon. When moving faster than crouch-walking speed, the Active Camo cloaks the user only partially and drains the amount of Active Camo faster.

   The freedom for the player to control when they activate their camouflage makes it much more effective, as it allows for use in the most opportune situations, instead of restricting the player to activate it on pickup. However, the reduced hearing and radar jamming effects require the player to be aware of his/her surroundings at all times.

   Unlike previous games, if you are wielding an Energy Sword and use the Active Camouflage armor ability your sword will not show. This allows you to get closer to the enemy without them suspecting danger, maybe even getting them to charge.
   If a Spartan or Sangheili is to have their shields damaged in any way, their shields will flare when the damage is dealt and when the shield starts to recharge, outlining the unfortunate being in a yellow (UNSC) or blue (
