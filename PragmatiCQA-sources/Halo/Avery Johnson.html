   Avery Junior Johnson was born in the sprawling industrial section of
   Chicago
   ,
   Illinois
   near the Great Lakes in the
   United States of America
   .
   His family broke up when he was six years old and he was placed in the care of his aunt by
   Zone Protective Services
   .
   One situation that Johnson had fond memories of was his first day of church, as his Aunt tried her best to get the large shoes and small clothes of his cousins to fit him. Her religious beliefs were carried on by Johnson and often made him question his own decision to kill other

Byrne would hold a great deal of animosity towards Johnson for quite some time as a result of this incident.

   present in Johnson’s blood, but it was dormant and non-infectious.

   Halsey placed the decision of which data crystal to give to ONI in John's hands. If he gave them the first crystal, ONI would probably have dissected Johnson in an attempt to figure out how he resisted the Flood, killing the Sergeant.

Johnson and his team proceeded to continue through the woods, and arrived at the evacuation site several moments before the Arbiter and John-117.

   Prophet of Truth
   shut down the base's power and started speaking on the video monitor, telling the group that they would all, including their Demon (John-117), die. After the Prophet's tirade ended and the power came back on, Commander Keyes ordered the base evacuated. Johnson and some Marines stayed behind to defend the ops center, which had an armed bomb in it, while John-117 and the Arbiter went off to secure the perimeter. After much fighting, they were forced to return to the ops center, as Jiralhanae had overrun it.

He later brought in a platoon of Marines lead by Gunnery Sergeant Stacker, and some tanks from the frigate, helping throughout the mission, until the location of Truth was discovered from the

   He then went on to command the second squad in taking down the third tower that was projecting the shield barrier protecting Truth in the
   Citadel
   . There, he, along with his squad, were overrun and captured by overwhelming Jiralhanae, Hunter and Drone forces. Johnson's squad was killed, and he was brought to the Citadel.

   The Prophet of Truth attempted to use Johnson to activate the Ark, and set off the Halo array, but he only taunted the Jiralhanae, in particular a
   Chieftain
   , in hopes of angering the Jiralhanae to the point where he would kill him, and deny Truth the ability to activate the array. Miranda Keyes attempted to rescue him by crashing a Pelican through a large observatory window. Keyes was able to kill one Jiralhanae, a Chieftain, and fatally wounded another, but was surrounded. Realizing what the Prophet of Truth wished to use them for, Johnson told her that she should kill them both so they could not be used. While Keyes hesitated, Truth shot her in the back with a
   Spiker
   , killing her instantly. The disheartened Johnson was then forced to activate the Array. Johnson was rescued by John-117 and Thel 'Vadam, along with a horde of Flood. After John-117 deactivated the array, the Flood turned on the three, and while Johnson managed to escape on Keyes' Pelican with her body, John and the Arbiter were knocked off by the Gravemind, forced to fight their way back through the Flood.

This was possible because Cortana still held within her the code to the Index from Installation 04, the first Halo. After John-117 invaded

   John-117
   left his body in the Control Room as the ring activated, its unfinished state meaning that the activation sequence tore itself apart. Johnson's body was disintegrated in the explosion while Chief and Thel 'Vadam took Johnson's Warthog to escape on the

  <p key="b1509b88-29d2-4fd2-b7e3-202d6ce5c82c">
   Avery Johnson's behavior seems to be eccentric, often delivering outlandish speeches to boost the morale of those serving under him.
   However, when it came down to it, he was a no-nonsense NCO, who, although caring deeply for his troops, pushed them hard during training.
  </p>
  <p key="e5aa9354-602d-42bb-9081-6fe26a1d1856">
   Another seemingly peculiar aspect of his behavior is that he never considered

   human fighting for humanity, as well as the Sangheili, once they joined forces with the UNSC in. In return, Thel 'Vadam respected him as well, before and after his death, saying sorrowfully to John, "I am sorry, Spartan" and "Even in death, your Sergeant guides us all."
  </p>
  <p key="20f0c235-a52b-4c28-a170-13fbd7b0ebf8">
   Johnson also has the tendency to give his enemies and enemy objects nicknames. Examples include: Guilty Spark being called Lightbulb and Tinkerbell, Tartarus being called Mr. Mohawk, and Unyielding Hierophant being called "Uneven Elephant."

   , his serious and more "straight-to-the-point" side is seen more often, and he seems to fight more for the sake of getting it done, rather than enjoying himself as he did in. This may be due to age, his encounters with the Flood, the Human-Covenant War finally taking its toll on him, or a combination of the three.

   Johnson seems to not be as tolerant of enemies or violent individuals as
   John-117
