   Kurt was unusually sociable for a SPARTAN, and considered the well-being of his teammates more important than the orders of his commanding officers. While the rest of his teammates were closely guarded and private unless in the presence of fellow SPARTANs, Kurt spent a considerable amount of time making friends, such as with the drill instructors. This made some of his fellow SPARTANs uneasy, as they were not comfortable with a leader who was so easily distracted. Despite these perceptions, Kurt proved himself to be an extremely proficient leader.
   After his indoctrination into the SPARTAN-III program, his leadership qualities became even more pronounced.
