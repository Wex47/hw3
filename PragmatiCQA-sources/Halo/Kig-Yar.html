   During their early history, Kig-Yar society was divided into clans that sailed across Eayn's seas as pirates, raiding the encampments and settlements of rival clans. Eventually, the clans united, and the Kig-Yar species worked together in developing space-travel technology. Shortly afterward, they established colonies on many small asteroids around
   Chu'ot
   . Some Kig-Yar continued their ancient ways of life and became
   pirates
   once more, preying upon merchant starships. These groups of pirates were the Kig-Yar's only effective response to the overwhelming

   The war between the Covenant and Kig-Yar forces culminated in sieges of redoubts on the asteroids surrounding their world. Eventually, in order to survive, they accepted Letters of Marque: commissions from the
   Ministry of Tranquility
   to engage in the services of the Covenant, though often this was merely used as an excuse to continue their plundering lifestyle. The Kig-Yar would spend much of their time preying on the ships of the Covenant's enemies, such as humanity.

   Kig-Yar bear notable resemblances to extinct maniraptoran dinosaurs from Earth, and in spite of their extraterrestrial origin, they exhibit a multitude of both avialan and reptilian traits. Like birds and various species of dinosaur, Kig-Yar have warm-blooded metabolisms, feathers, quills, and beaks. Their more reptilian traits include teeth and scales, with scaly integument being distributed throughout most of the body in Ruutian and Ibie'shan individuals. Their legs are sinewy and muscular, and are digitigrade in a similar fashion to birds. They have sharp claws on both hands and feet. Kig-Yar are an omnivorous species, though they were initially thought to be carnivores due to their dentition and feeding habits. Their jaws are lined with rows of razor-sharp teeth; some have far more numerous teeth which bear a passing resemblance to
   baleen
   .
   Kig-Yar have been known to eat the flesh of fallen enemies, as well as live prisoners. Kig-Yar have extraordinary senses of sight, hearing, and smell. Male Kig-Yar possess plumages of spiny quills at the back of the head and on the elbows; the color of this plumage indicates the Kig-Yar's mood.
   Females of the Ruutian subspecies lack these quill plumages, instead having calloused plates at the forearms and the rear of the head. This thick skin flushes with blood and stiffens, this helps protect the female during courtship: when mating, the male will often bite, chew, and tear at the back of the female's head, neck, and arms. However, T'vaoan and Ibie'shan females retain their plumes, though the feathers of T'vaoan females are much shorter than those of males.

   While Kig-Yar have hollow bones and are physically frail compared to most other Covenant races, they are capable of moving quickly to evade harm. As a consequence, Kig-Yar are highly vulnerable to firearms. In spite of their relatively frail bodies, they are still large and strong enough to overpower a fully-trained Human soldier in physical combat, though their physical strength is often useless against augmented soldiers created by the
   SPARTAN Program
   . Their blood is bright purple in color, similar to that of the Sangheili, possibly showing a similar chemical makeup. The lack of calcium in their skeletons makes them a poor source of biomass for the

   Kig-Yar reproduce by laying eggs which the female incubates in a nest, similar to birds. Females are also capable of asexual reproduction in the form of parthenogenesis (virgin birth), and can produce offspring without mating. This ability plays a part in their sex determination system. Fertile eggs produced via mating hatch into males, whereas unfertilized eggs will hatch into females.

   The Kig-Yar species is divided into at least three subspecies: the lighter
   Ruutian
   ,
   Ibie'shan
   and the more muscular
   T'vaoan
   Each subspecies exhibits distinct variations in appearance and physiology. Kig-Yar typically exhibit light brown or tan skin tones, though some individuals feature gray-green or red skin;
   flexible quills on the head and forearms among males, with calloused plates among females; and elongated, small heads with elongated snouts and bulbous eyes, though some Kig-Yar have heads akin to those of the Skirmishers.
   Ibie'shan are similar in appearance, but feature a more reptilian features. It appears that Skirmishers are darker in color, with true feathers on their heads and arms, and have shorter, squared heads with small yellow eyes. While all three subspecies are quite agile, Skirmishers are capable of sprinting at great speeds and leaping incredible distances.
  </p>
  <p key="95f4dc42-6715-4bd4-a21a-ceec8364aea6">
   The reason behind the differing subspecies is unknown, though it has been theorized that it may be a result of the Kig-Yar adapting to different continents and colony worlds over millennia.
   The
   Ibie'shan
   are a subspecies from the isolated continent of
   Ibie'sh
   , on
   Eayn
   .
   T'vaoans
   , on the other hand, are a subspecies that originated on the Kig-Yar colony of
   T'vao
   .
   The most common "Kig-Yar" subspecies,
   Ruutian
   , originates from a landmass on Eayn known as
   Ruuht
   .

   . Kig-Yar have been known to coexist relatively peacefully with humans, as evidenced by the relationship between the Rubble and Reth's forces on
   Metisette
   . When the Kig-Yar were finally ordered by the Prophets to attack and destroy the humans of the Rubble, many of them even regretted the order. This is likely due to the pragmatic, mercantile culture of their race: As long as it benefits them economically, Kig-Yar will co-operate with nearly any group, even declared enemies of the Covenant.

   Kig-Yar serve primarily as light infantry, police forces and overseers. Kig-Yar privateers also commonly crew Covenant missionary ships, such as

   . Originally, they were intended to replace the Unggoy as the foot soldiers of the Covenant, but their temperament made this impractical. Instead, they were assigned roles that were better suited to their natural abilities, such as scouts and snipers.
  </p>
  <p key="f032404b-0442-471f-b2dc-9bd2e02f7e35">
   Within Covenant society, Kig-Yar have little status and are subservient to all but the Unggoy. Because of this, Kig-Yar frequently harass Unggoy to assert what little authority they have. In some cases, Sangheili or Jiralhanae dispose of criminals or prisoners by feeding them to Kig-Yar convicts, who eat the victim alive.
  </p>
  <p key="16846276-0d6e-4a34-9fee-3c26aaf1b0df">
   Due to their unique position in the Covenant, the Kig-Yar often utilize starships of their own making instead of Covenant-made ones. In addition, they are forbidden to build their own slipspace drives, and have to rely on heavily regulated, unmodifiable drives engineered by the San'Shyuum instead.
   Royal female Kig-Yar have known to become shipmistresses of these ships and effectively manage various combat and patrol scenarios.
  </p>
  <p key="eddf9697-1abd-4eff-808f-5bb82b4ced40">
   The Kig-Yar are not represented on the High Council but are instead vetted by the Ministry of Concert. The Kig-Yar do not vocally complain about their position but instead have elected to siphon off resources to their brethren. Whether the Covenant leadership was aware of this is currently unknown.

   The Kig-Yar government on Eayn is a post-industrial capitalist system with a population of 978 million.
   It is also described as an
   ochlocracy
   , a system of government best described as a government by mob, or the intimidation of constitutional authorities. Presumably, this implies that whatever form of local government the Kig-Yar possess is ineffective and ignored.

   Since the Kig-Yar's despotic days, to its current global government, female Kig-Yar are at the apex of power in their society. Females control breeding rights, territory, familial organization, and control of major assets. After the collapse of the Covenant, the Kig-Yar matriarchal government still exists.

   , have multiple syllables in their names. It is speculated that the Kig-Yar naming system is at least partially based on sex, rank, or both. However, their naming system might not be the one of their own culture; it has been stated that Sangheili do not allow the Kig-Yar to have more than one name. Alternatively, it may be that the Kig-Yar language consists of single syllable words (their name for themselves, Kig-Yar, actually is two single syllable words combined).

   Eayn is the homeworld of the Kig-Yar species and is the primary satellite of the planet Chu'ot. It is characterized by its single equatorial ocean, sparse volcanism, and almost total lack of glaciation. Only about one-third of all Kig-Yar who still reside in the Y'deio system call Eayn their home; many have chosen to live among the minor planets within the asteroid belt since their initial contact with the Covenant. However, it is theorized that the Kig-Yar have colonized many other planets, due to their physiological diversity.

      Kig-Yar Heavies are the most experienced and skilled of their species. They are more heavily armored than regular Kig-Yar Storms and wield stronger, yellow point defense gauntlets. They are usually equipped with Needlers. Because of their armor they can take more damage than a typical Kig-Yar Storm. Kig-Yar Heavies can be found in black, grey, teal, red, blue, green, brown, and gold armor.

      The Kig-Yar Storm is the basic Kig-Yar infantry of Jul 'Mdama's Covenant. They wield light blue point defense gauntlets and usually use Plasma Pistols. This rank is the equivalent of the Kig-Yar Minor in the Covenant Empire. It's more reptilian appearance indicates it to be a subspecies of Kig-Yar from the isolated continent of Ibie'sh. This is a likely explanation for why when compared to the Kig-Yar in the original Covenant, the Storm Kig-Yar is more vicious. They can be found in red/maroon, green, black, yellow, teal, and gold armor.
