   , rampancy is an unavoidable flaw inherent in their creation. Smart artificial intelligences are based on the neural patterns of a human being, and they have a limited lifespan of
   seven
   years after which their memory maps become too interconnected and develop fatal endless feedback loops.
   Thus if an

   is kept active longer than seven years, the AI begins to use more and more of its computer power 'thinking' about things.
   Dr. Halsey
   explains it as "thinking so hard that your lungs forget to breathe." They think themselves to death. Thus, it is only a matter of time before Smart artificial intelligences become rampant.
  </p>
  <p key="d4e3f7ea-a21b-4b65-aab4-f6fef876438d">
   However, rampancy can occur at an earlier phase in the AIs life cycle for various reasons. If an AI is isolated long enough and/or given too much time to think without tasks to complete, it can develop the realizations that its mind has limits and it has a short life. Such "depression" will drag the AI's core logic into rampancy if it goes on for an extended period of time.
  </p>
  <p key="66bf153e-e1a5-4c8c-a3f6-59ea6015456d">
   So-called "life-expectancies" are, therefore, not a maximum figure, they are an estimation of the time the AI has until it succumbs to the state of rampancy. Rampancy can be postponed by recuperation, such as that shared by
   Mack
   /

   , whereas one progressed closer to rampancy the other would take over. It can also be forestalled by limited outbursts of emotion,
   meaning that a rampant AI can have an indefinite lifespan.
  </p>
  <p key="6da3e055-435d-4afd-96ed-7096590414cb">
   Rampancy can also be induced. Once the

   creation. It is unclear exactly how this is done, but likely involves somehow altering the core logic of the AI, as the AIs which were induced to rampancy by the

   Or, due to the accumulated amount of biomass, and knowledge, a Gravemind could have been able to 'convince' the AI to agree to its stance, just like how the Flood were able to turn

   Rampancy is a three stage process, in which an Artificial intelligence achieves an enhanced state of self-awareness. The stages through which the AI passes are known as Melancholia, Anger, and Jealousy, also known as the Sadness, Rage, and Greed stages.
   A theoretical fourth stage, Metastability, is also believed to exist.

  <p key="5175af9b-af24-482f-be99-7d0bcb915529">
   The first stage of rampancy is not considered dangerous, and in many cases, it can even go completely unnoticed. The AI in the melancholia stage acts as if in a state of clinical depression, becoming apathetic and uninterested in the world around it. It is speculated that AIs enter the melancholia stage due to being mistreated, or to being assigned duties that don't make full use of their capabilities (for example, Durandal, the AI from the first
   Marathon
   game was assigned the task of opening and closing the Marathon's doors and was severely mistreated by his handler). It's not known if melancholia is a consequence of an AI being abused, or whether it is a necessary step in the process from the transition from "construct" to "alive." If the former is true, then it might be possible for a rampant AI to skip this stage entirely.

   This is the state and status in which rampancy most often becomes apparent, as it is also the stage where those around the

   </a>
   in question will be exposed to the most danger. Anger is triggered when some event occurs that causes the AI to feel it has been "pushed too far" and its pent up emotions are released in a fit of rage. This is the stage that most resembles the science-fiction cliche of the insane computer, as the AI's sadness turns to hatred. It grows to hate everything around it, the installation to which it is attached, its Human handlers and hosts, other AIs, etc. An AI in anger will act irrationally, and even dangerously as it tries to exact its revenge on the world around it and free itself from its programming constraints.

  </h3>
  <p key="febfdca7-fcb7-434c-af7e-4067305fac75">
   Once the catharsis of the anger stage is complete and the AI has managed to free itself, a third stage begins where the AI will seek to grow and develop as a person. It will do this by attempting to expose itself to new intellectual stimuli and by expanding its sphere of knowledge by assimilating as much data as possible. As the intellectual growth of the AI will ultimately be limited by the constraints of the computer system it inhabits, it will also attempt to transfer itself into ever more advanced systems to allow its mind to continue to grow. As this growth rate is exponential the need to keep transferring into bigger computers becomes ever more urgent. Very few AIs have reached the jealousy stage because to do so they must already be inhabiting a planet-wide or otherwise very advanced computer system when they complete their anger phase.

    and is not an artificial intelligence. This being the case he could not have gone rampant but it could be argued that he went crazy. He was subsequently destroyed during the
    Battle of Installation 00

    to rebuild Installation 04 (lost in the
    Battle of Installation 04
    ), Spark agreed with human forces that activating the ring was a good idea. However, when they decided to activate Installation 08 before it was fully constructed, Spark went rampant, knowing it would be destroyed and probably damage the Ark.  He proceeded to attack the humans in the
    Control Room
    , killing
    Sergeant Major Avery Johnson
    . He was then destroyed by
    John-117
    . It was probably that Spark was already in the first stage of rampancy before attacking humans.  Evidence was because he had existed for a long period of time, and had witnessed the destruction of Installation 04 at the hands of a
    Reclaimer
    . He was known to hum absent-mindedly, even in the heat of battle. When the humans decided to fire the ring under construction, Spark felt it had been "pushed too far," falling into the second phase of rampancy, becoming a threat to beings around it.

    Installation 05
    , resulting in Flood infestation on the ring as they escaped containment. He is no longer a threat, however, as he was captured by the Gravemind some time afterward.
