   Roads are the primary communication links to all sectors of the economy and the population. It is widely recognized that an efficient road infrastructure is a prerequisite for economic and social development. In the twenty-first century, roads are referred to by a wide range of names and descriptions - National, Main, Trunk, District, City, Rural, Local, Access etc. However, roads can be broadly categorized according to the Authority primarily responsible for their management as national, district, urban and special purpose roads. National Roads are the main highways of the classified road network comprising Class A, B, C roads and are managed by the Roads Department of the Ministry of Roads and Public Works. These roads provide mobility in a national context and the traffic on these roads is usually associated with longer travel distances. Hence design provisions for these roads allow for relatively higher speeds and minimal interference with through traffic i.e. restricted access. Class A are international trunk roads linking international boundaries or terminating at international ports e.g. Malaba-Nairobi-Mombasa Road.

   In 1998, Kenya and its Partner States agreed on the East African Road Network Project. The project consists of five major regional road corridors, two are briefly described herebelow. The

   The A23 resides in the western edge of the Coastal province of Kenya and is part of both the Mombasa - Malaba - Katuna, and the Dar as Salaam - Dodoma - Isaka - Mutukula - Masaka corridors according to modern-day geographical boundaries. In the twenty-first century, the A23 road begins at Voi and passes on to Arusha that is in Tanzania. Smaller towns lying between these population centres are, Maktau, Murka, Taveta, Holili(Tanzania) and Moshi(Tanzania) in that order. There is also a railway that runs the same route. Highway A23 joins directly onto highway A109 at Voi, and connects Nairobi and Mombasa. By the 21st century, this and all other national roads were maintained under the Roads Department of Ministry of Roads and Public Works, affiliated with the Kenya Roads Board.

   When the industrial revolution of East Africa begun, everything that was transported to and from Mombasa had to be mediated by Voi to Nairobi and Dodoma in the Republic of Tanzania. This caused Voi to be greatly influenced by the revolution and it co-evolved industrially with Mombasa. Because of the increased heavy traffic from and to Voi, the old national A23 highway had fallen into disrepair. Under the authority of
   Tterrab Industries
   , it is decided to construct an entirely new highway, though most prefer the name

   rather than the four-digit code simply due to the fact that it is easier to recognize. Instead of replacing the A23, it was decided to be built parallel to it, thus allowing traffic to flow uninterrupted. The 'new' highway is an approximate 1.2Â km

   parallel to the A23. In the twenty-sixth century, the old A23 was abandoned and only still used by the local farmers to avoid the heavy traffic.
