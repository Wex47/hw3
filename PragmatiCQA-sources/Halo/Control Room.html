   The temple structure and edifice had the same basic triangular shape as Installation 04's control room, with a long support beam running from the ground to the top of the structure. There were minor aesthetic differences, including the walkways on each level being more narrow, as well as the tower at the top being replaced by a large flat landing.

  <p key="91ac14d9-f10d-41e5-8ba1-40844ad10f88">
   The actual control room and control panel is scarcely different from the original. The large dome-shaped room still showed a holographic image of the halo ring, although Threshold was missing from that image (as the ring has not been moved to that point). It was here where John-117 fights 343 Guilty Spark when he goes rampant because
   John-117
   is going to destroy his installation.

  <p key="2d0f3786-6dd3-4cab-be29-164c7970378c">
   The "newer" design could also be what Installation 04 originally looked like before the Flood outbreak and the activation of the Halos by the

   The Control Room to
   Installation 09
   was radically different from Installation 04 and 08. Unlike the previous two iterations, 04C's was located in a jungle biome, in the midst of several Forerunner platforms. It appeared that the primary entrance to the facility was through
   Forerunner elevators

    The control room was first seen in the BETA pre-Xbox version of Halo demo in 1999. In the video, the control room was practically 3 times smaller than the versions seen in the Halo trilogy.
   </li>
   <li key="6d63550e-146b-4bbf-abd0-f481942c8750">
    It is most likely that the appearance of the control rooms differ with each Installation since the design of the one found of Installation 04 bears almost no resemblance to the one on Installation 05. It is also believed that as each Halo was built, their control room designs appeared more elaborate and well-defended. For example, Installation 04's control room is smaller than Installation 05's control room. In addition in terms of defense, 04's 1st control room (before its first destruction) was defended by obstacles such as, a series of ramps and stairs, a series of poorly defended blast doors (door control panels horribly placed in terms of strategy), along with a slightly yet passable platform/ramp complete with an observation tower. In comparison to 05's, it's surrounded by fortified walls with architecture similar to the
    Citadel
    located on the

    , inner corridors consists of obstacles such as a series of blast doors (similar to 04's) and several platforms that must be climbed to reach the Installation's controls, a moat/trench around the complexes perimeter, and its entrance is suspended above an island surrounded by neighboring defensive islands.

   <li key="df8c87b4-1656-4307-81cd-b39bc6247b3a">
    It has been noted, that when viewed from the top, the main console room of Installation 04 resembles the
    Marathon
    logo. This can also be seen in the Installation 08 Control Room.
