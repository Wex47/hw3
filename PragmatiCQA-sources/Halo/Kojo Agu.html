   He is shown interacting aggressively or abrasively with almost every squad member, as they will tell him to show some respect, including striking the
   Rookie
   with his
   Sniper Rifle
   to wake him up. He is good friends with
   Dutch
   , the squad's heavy weapons specialist. In his old unit, Romeo racked-up multiple code of conduct violations, any one of which should have resulted in demotion—or worse.
   However, he was kept because the UNSC was running out of battle tested snipers, and Romeo is one of the best. He is a consummate combatant, but also saw himself as something of a ladies' man. He is proud of his colonial background, and doesn't hold much respect toward Earth. Prior to the Battle of Earth, he had never been to Earth, and had only seen it from the window of a transport. While he is still listed as a Madrigali citizen, Romeo's last known place of residence is
   Holetown
   on the colony of
   Emerald Cove

   Romeo was born in the
   Castra arcology
   in
   Castra
   on
   Madrigal
   in
   2524
   .
   His homeworld was glassed by the

   when he was only four years-old, but he managed to survive the glassing. Before enlisting in
   2541
   , he served in the
   UNSC commercial fleet
   . He later became an ODST when he angered the
   Governor
   at the colony of Castra by having an affair with the Governor's wife. This prompted the Governor to call upon people he knew in the UNSC who in turn sent Romeo into the ODSTs to keep him away from the Governor's wife. During his tenure with the ODSTs, Romeo served on various colony planets, such as
   Coral
   ,
   Mamore
   ,
   New Jerusalem
   , and
   Beta Gabriel
   , with a remarkable 100% kill rate.

    Battle of Ariel

  </h3>
  <p key="16eb6129-00e5-4a36-8ee2-ccec0b111069">
   In early 2552, Romeo and Dutch served in an ODST unit commanded by
   MSgt
   Frost
   . Before being deployed to planet
   Ariel
   , he and
   another ODST
   were discussing the Spartans and expressed extreme disbelief over their claimed fighting prowess. When another ODST,
   Brimley
   heard this, he told them that a
   teenage Spartan trainee
   had killed his friend
   Langston
   27 years ago. In his typical fashion, Romeo burst out laughing, ridiculing Langston for being killed by a teenager. This led to a fight with Brimley, and Romeo was coming off worse until
   Dutch
   interfered in the fight. Sergeant Frost confined them both to their quarters because of the fight.
  </p>
  <p key="6cdb3405-edc6-4a5e-930e-e6492da07b99">
   Later, inside Ariel's generator complex, Romeo and Dutch were cut off from the remainder of the ODST unit. It was there that they learned that the Covenant was digging for something. After a brief engagement with two
   <a href="Sangheili.html" key="be52be14-11e6-4fe0-b9e6-5ca68977247a" title="Sangheili">
    Sangheili
   </a>
   (whose corpses were later used as shields to survive a generator explosion), the two found an injured
   <a href="Unggoy.html" key="a97469c5-769a-4ff3-b865-1093959bfe68" title="Unggoy">
    Unggoy
   </a>
   . They attempted to interrogate it, but its only reply was "knowing." Romeo pretended to let the Unggoy go before killing it, believing it to be a liability.
  </p>
  <p key="82df011c-d870-44c1-93b9-940b365949aa">
   After evading three Unggoy and a
   legion
   of Sangheili, the two made plans to steal a
   Phantom
   . They proceeded to kill an Unggoy, use its corpse as a ruse, and then eliminate several Covenant infantrymen guarding the Phantom. However, a Sangheili managed to down the ship. The ODSTs bailed out before it crashed, falling through a building's skylight and into a building where the planet's missing colonists were being held hostage by an Unggoy.
  </p>
  <p key="6b67035b-5030-44f9-a23d-5407ef2d15a8">
   The ODSTs made short work of the Unggoy and learned that the colonists had been forced to dig deep into the planet's surface, activating several traps along the way. The ODSTs entered the dig site intending to liberate other colonists; it was there that they found what the Covenant was looking for: an

   called
   The Knowing
   . If the Covenant got their hands on it, then they could wipe out humanity down to their last DNA strand.
  </p>
  <p key="32a9d28d-69d2-4afe-9103-e4d9f7d98cc4">
   Though Dutch believed that the Knowing would be beneficial to the UNSC, Romeo preferred to destroy it (per ONI standing orders). Romeo asked the Knowing to activate its self-destruct and direct them out of the complex. As they made their way out, Romeo tripped over a Unggoy's body and broke his ankle. Dutch carried him and managed to escape the blast. When they got back to the surface, they were reunited with their squad, who had seen the Covenant fleeing the planet because of Knowing's destruction.
  </p>
  <p key="89cf420a-6d21-4eeb-b1ab-3c077ded52e2">
   Later, Dutch visited Romeo while he was on the infirmary bed. Romeo stated that he filed in a transfer to be with Dutch; he told his friend that he withdrew his. They both tried Rock, Paper, Scissors to decide who would go.

   to Romeo's punctured lung, the squad decided a risky move to hijack a Phantom, and finally escape the city. Eventually, Romeo and the rest of the squad escaped New Mombasa aboard the captured Phantom after going back and finding both the Rookie and Dare. They were last seen a month later, in an orbital ONI facility.
