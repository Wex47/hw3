   . This is later put to use by the Prophet of Truth, in realization that the Luminary's reading of the humans as Reclaimers would help him scour the galaxy for any other human colonies. This may help explain why Covenant forces are so often quick to converge on the position of John-117 in an otherwise vast and barren network of tunnels as found in the Halo constructs. Mendicant also claims that the humans are his makers, which corroborates what 343 Guilty Spark says to the Master Chief in

   species are referred to as "intruders" or "meddlers" by 343 Guilty Spark. In addition, non-Reclaimers are unable to access or fully utilize Forerunner weapon systems on the Halo rings, the Ark, and Shield Worlds (as well as, most likely, other Forerunner constructs that have not yet been discovered). Because of this, the
   Prophet of Truth
   had to force Sergeant Johnson to activate the rings in

   <i key="68790c55-6bbf-44b6-aacb-0cf4b213f4d0">
    Halo: Ghosts of Onyx
   </i>
   , the
   Sentinels
   do not identify the humans on Onyx as Reclaimers. It could be that Sentinels only possess limited analytical intelligence while apart from a controlling
   <a href="Monitor.html" key="18d998a3-971c-42cb-b15c-accd63063439" title="Monitor">
    Monitor
   </a>
   . It is safe to speculate that the Monitors, as custodians of the Halo installations, play an important role in helping local Sentinels determine who is friendly and who is not. This is noted by the behaviors of the Sentinels on the first Halo construct that the Master Chief visits: namely, their general ignorance of the Chief until the Monitor demanded that they attack. It should also be noted that the first human a Sentinel tried to identify on Onyx was
   Ash-G099
   , one of the
   <a href="SPARTAN-III Program.html" key="f51c2ade-c28b-4389-b3b9-98f71e7945c5" title="SPARTAN-III Program">
    Spartan-IIIs
   </a>
   . All of the Spartan-III's possessed artificial augmentations, most notably a cocktail of illegal drugs, which were designed to affect the brain's frontal lobe to enhance certain traits in combat. This may have been reasonable enough for the Sentinel to identify him as something other than human or Reclaimer (after Ash spoke to it, the Sentinel said, "Reclassification of targets as non-Reclaimers. Aboriginal subspecies."
   ), and after that the Sentinels may have simply assumed that all humans on Onyx were of the same classification. Logically, by the term "subspecies", and by the aboriginal notation therein, the Sentinels could easily, by conjecture, be making the notice that the chemical changes in the brain caused by their augmentations cause the Spartan-IIIs to represent an earlier, more animalistic breed of humanity to their scanners.
  </p>
  <p key="275a9a8f-fe6e-40f6-a587-16b1c3290910">
   However, this reclassification could have also been caused simply by Ash not exchanging the proper response to the Sentinel as it had asked him. The fact that, initially, it automatically identified Ash as a Reclaimer on sight (which never once happened when Forerunner technology came into contact with Covenant species) supports the theory that the human species as a whole, rather than some specific members of it, were deemed Reclaimers by the Forerunners. When it reclassified him it also said he was a possible infection vector,
   whereupon the Sentinels' increased hostility may have had to do with a directive about preventing any way for the Flood to infiltrate the Shield World. It seems entirely possible (given that the Forerunners were ultimately willing to sacrifice themselves in order to halt the Flood's advance across the galaxy) that even an actual Forerunner that did not know the proper response, should an Onyx Sentinel have somehow come into contact with one, would have been treated the same way in order to halt a possible Flood infestation.

    It is possible that 343 Guilty Spark does not recognize Reclaimers as individuals, but instead believes that every Reclaimer is the same being. When talking to Master Chief in
    Installation 04
    's Control Room, Spark says, "Last time, you asked me, if it were my choice, would I do it? Having had considerable time to ponder your query, my answer has not changed."
    It seems that Guilty Spark was referring to a question posed to him by a Forerunner -
    <a href="Bornstellar-Makes-Eternal-Lasting.html" key="571e298c-76e5-457a-a74b-60e7b0d5583a" title="Bornstellar-Makes-Eternal-Lasting">

     this

    Reclaimer is delicate," assumedly referencing the Master Chief's durability as contrasted to Keyes'. It is also possible that 343 Guilty Spark believes that the Reclaimers are one mind in many bodies. Another theory: Spark's statement to the Master Chief could just have been a result of his instability; somewhat like humming in battle. Another more complex idea is that since all humans seem to be able to be classified as Reclaimers, and Spark when speaking to the Chief (a Reclaimer) on Installation 04B states "You are the child of my makers, inheritor of all they left behind. You are Forerunner." Spark views the Chief as a continuation of the Forerunners, and the "same" as
    The Didact
    . Other characters also reference the humans as the same as the Forerunner in some fashion. Spark said that humanity holds the Forerunner's duties (Reclamation, The Mantle etc.), Mendicant Bias holds himself in debt to humanity when he cannot find any Forerunner to redeem himself to, and the
