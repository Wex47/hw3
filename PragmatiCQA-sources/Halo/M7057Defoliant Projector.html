   , the Flamethrower is a very powerful weapon, laying waste to any opponent in close quarters. It can be used strategically to put flame in front of entry ways as a denial of entry, or to shoot it while running backwards around a corner (giving you the ability to damage them while denying them a direct line of sight to you).

  <p key="cfb62b21-4808-4332-98a6-76a0c7a8e119">

   . The spread, stickiness, and lethality of the flame makes it nearly impossible to escape when in the hands of a skilled player. However, in rare cases, if a player walks through a

   ), the game engine will ignore the damage and the player will survive (with low shields). Effective utilization of the chemically-active volatile spray and the damage-per-second (
   <i key="09e46983-98d0-40da-9804-04bf967075ae">

   ) dynamic can make the Flamethrower the most effective shield-stripping tool in the game, as it can easily tear through shields with close proximity short-burst shots (making the opponent a "One-Shot"), allowing another teammate to quickly finish off the opponent with a single head shot. It is very effective to use around corners or at entrances, a tactic called "camping," but even though you cannot crouch and hide while using the Flamethrower, it is a great weapon to use in conjunction with this tactic as enemies can be quickly stopped with a quick ignition. The Flamethrower in the

   throwing in tandem with Flamethrower-spray can effectively quell any enemy infantry and provide a formidable force of explosions. The Flamethrower can also be used as a psychological weapon, as its mere appearance and use strikes fear into the enemy. Another thing to remember is that the flame remains on the ground for a couple of seconds, allowing a user to temporarily block a door or corner in a confined space. The Flamethrower excels in small games and on small or enclosed maps where there is little chance of killing a teammate.

   , the Flamethrower's reload rate is very slow, making the player vulnerable to all sorts of attack. Additionally, the Flamethrower, along with its fuel supply, is very rare, and respawns at a very slow rate. The Flamethrower is also incapable of doing ranged attacks; therefore, while using this weapon in combat, your movement options are limited. It also flouts a powerless range ability, which can ‘‘clearly’’ be seen from afar, making you a target for snipers or sharpshooters.

   , like with all support weapons, you cannot refuel the Flamethrower. Maneuverability is much more difficult and movement speed is slowed, and the player wielding a Flamethrower cannot melee. You also cannot throw grenades or use equipment without having to drop it first. The Flamethrower is only a threat (potentially to all players) in confined spaces; in open spaces, it's very hard to directly harm your opponent. The Flamethrower also makes it impossible to crouch and to disappear on enemy motion sensors--making stealthiness an impossible component of battle while wielding the projector. The

   (damage per second) aspect of this weapon also makes it potentially lethal to all players, as the chemically projected fluid will pool on all surfaces (even ceilings and walls) for a brief period (yet on the ground the pool lasts longer) and can be a deadly trap for any player nearby. Once ignited, depending on the range and amplitude of ignition (how much of the fluid is burning upon you) the player's shields will quickly, or slowly, fall respectively. The only way to combat the "burn"
   <i key="2ff73131-12df-4bf7-84d1-c4f0751be515">

   </i>
   effect is to use a
   Regenerator
   , however this may not save those that are fully ignited. Another danger to this weapon is that when an enemy is ignited, depending on the exact
   <i key="e95415bf-1b34-4459-858a-66b675fabd13">
    DPS
   </i>
   ratio (if they are fully ignited and they are burning fast, or if they're only ignited a bit and they're burning more slowly), the enemy may run up to the user while on fire and cause a secondary proximity ignition to everyone around them, even their teammates. This danger is similar to the lethal proximity of an enemy stuck with a
   Plasma Grenade
   or a
   Spike Grenade
   that can simply run up to you and kill you with the same explosion that kills them.

   This weapon can be very messy and hard to maneuver for early first-time players so it is generally advised that experienced players use the weapon, as it is very easy to betray teammates with the spray. Also, once the weapon is "overheated" it must be fully re-cooled before it can fire again. It is advisable to use the burst-fire tactic that one would use with the
   Assault rifle
   —this method not only conserves ammunition, but it allows for a safer spray and alleviates some of the dangers that come with rampant wide spray (betrayals, setting traps, etc.). The Flamethrower can also ignite nearby grenades, making it much more dangerous when many corpses are gathered (depending on the grenade count) or nearby grenade spawn points.

   The flamethrower is best used in close quarters combat. The trail of flame can act as a temporary smokescreen to blind snipers with. It is especially effective if used to retreat by running backwards away from an enemy to leave a trail of flame, deterring would-be pursuers from giving chase to a wall of fire, use caution because the flamethrower's damage is reduced when running backwards. It is effective as a denial of area weapon, you can set fire to doorways or flags to discourage anyone from crossing that area, and damaging those that do (possibly even catching on fire and killing unshielded opponents). Setting indestructible objectives on fire can discourage players playing for the objective.

   Most types of equipment can often be used to your advantage when escaping the flames, like deploying a
   Radar Jammer
   (although it is now not available in matchmaking) to confuse the enemy if he/she can't exactly see you due to the continuous flames, and since you'll be moving about, the enemy can't exactly identify you from the "fake" red dots on his/her radar.  Deploying a

   will cause the wielder of the Flamethrower to cease fire temporary to avoid having their shields to be drained if smart enough, however, if the wielder continues to fire they risk being drained of shields and made an easy target to any enemy players in the vicinity.

    Present-day flamethrowers have a range of up to one hundred meters (about 300 feet). Strangely, 540 years in the future, the range has decreased by 86%, the weight has significantly increased, and the ammunition capacity has decreased, but it is likely that it is just for gameplay purposes and is not as a canon element.

      In fact, this is a common nerf found in most video games, due to the fact that if a flamethrower was to behave as it would in real life, it could very easily decimate anything caught in its wake. So to prevent them from overtaking and destroying game balance, they often are portrayed as heavy, quick to burn through fuel supply, and having rather short ranges.
