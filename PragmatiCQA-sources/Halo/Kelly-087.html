   Kelly is notoriously fast, even by Spartan standards, easily making her the fastest human who ever lived. She is the fastest of all the other Spartans, capable of running at bursts of up to 62 KPH (38.502 MPH), has quicker reflexes than all other Spartans and is even capable of accomplishing normal tasks quickly and more precisely than her fellow Spartans. Before missions, she had to slow herself down considerably to spar with other Spartans. She has demonstrated an incredible tolerance for pain, as she has been injured quite gravely on several occasions and managed to recover fully each time.

  <p key="d06eac1f-22af-4d2c-8539-c27f1dec7ded">
   When she was younger, Kelly had her hair dyed blue and was taller than John. He eventually outgrew her and her hair color returned to its natural brown color. Kelly has a cynical sense of humor and often cracks jokes over her and her team's situation and mission. Her speed has led her to being termed the team's "rabbit," acting as quick bait to draw enemies into traps laid by the other Spartans.

   Kelly-087 was born on September 21, 2510, on the
   Inner Colony
   world of
   Imber
   . She was conscripted into the SPARTAN-II program at age six in
   2517
   when she was singled out as a physically and intellectually superior child by
   Dr. Catherine Halsey
   . During her abduction she eluded
   Retrieval team Gamma
   for six hours but eventually came forward when she thought the abduction was a game for her birthday.
   After her abduction she was replaced with a
   flash clone
   . She was then sent to
   Reach
   to begin her training.

   On her first day of Spartan training, Kelly was teamed up with John-117 and Sam-034 during a drill at
   Military Reservation 01478-B
   . Their team did poorly, because of the lack of teamwork, and finished in last place. As a consequence, they were not allowed to eat that night despite John 117's protest that he came first. The next day Kelly showed her true speed by running for a pulley lift, which she reached twice as quickly as John and Sam. They did not come first, but they did come in third. This was just the first of many times that her speed would be a key factor in strategies. The three of them became close friends that day. When the Spartans' heads were being shaved, Kelly disarmed the Master Sergeant barber of his clippers before three other attendants were able to pin her down and shave her head.

  <p key="65b60f9b-d41a-43c2-9b6e-1e9f0f6b962f">
   Kelly participated in numerous missions with the Spartans from 2517 to 2525, including those in
   Emerald Cove

   Chiron Test Station

   Military Wilderness Training Preserve

   Highland Mountains

   After her
   SPARTAN-II augmentation procedures
   at the
   ONI Medical Facility
   station, Kelly was close to death. She was the slowest to recover from the operations, and many of her fellow Spartans were afraid that she would not make it. She did, and her already amazing speed was even further augmented. John-117 noted that she was "... almost untouchable, no one could touch her if she didn't want them to."

   Later, in 2544,
   Kelly also participated in an ONI-led operation which required a squad of Spartans (consisting of Solomon-069, Arthur-079, Fred-104, John-117 and herself) to infiltrate Covenant-controlled space via
   booster frames
   and recover a stolen package from a Covenant fleet. The Covenant fleet was temporarily unable to enable their slipspace drive due to a stellar magnetic field, providing the Spartans some time to retrieve the package before the Covenant fleet departed. During the course of the operation,
   Arthur-079
   and
   Solomon-069
   were killed by the Covenant. The surviving Spartans then infiltrated the Covenant flagship and got separated as they made their way to the package which was revealed to be Dr. Catherine Halsey‎. The operation was successful with the Spartans escorting the "package" back to the ONI
   stealth ship

   Kelly's injuries turned out to be life-threatening; she had a fever and low blood pressure due to moderate bleeding in her liver, and one of her lungs had completely collapsed. Dr. Halsey noted that it was amazing Kelly was still alive, let alone still fighting, despite these two potentially fatal conditions.

   The Covenant attacked immediately and Dr. Halsey was forced to activate

   artifact. It sent a spike of radiation that allowed the Covenant to triangulate on the Spartans position and a gravity lift immediately appeared. The group was forced to retreat, but Vinh and Isaac disappeared after their

   Anton-044
