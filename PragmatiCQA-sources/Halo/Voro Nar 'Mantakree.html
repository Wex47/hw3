   Voro ordered Unggoy to remove Tano's body from the bridge but said leave Tano's blood remaining where it was as a reminder of the price he had paid for their survival.

   Voro voiced his opinion to 'Jar Wattinree and fellow Ship Masters that victory might mean nothing if the Flood upon Halo were to escape; it had to be cleansed from the galaxy if the Sangheili were to survive.
   Instead of having him killed, as Voro suspected, the Imperial Admiral instead acknowledged the truth of Voro's words.

   Second Fleet of Homogeneous Clarity

   to make a Slipspace jump to the northern pole of Onyx. Immediately after the ship exited Slipspace, a wave of Sentinels fired upon and destroyed

   before the ship's shields could come online. He then ordered no ships to enter Slipspace without his viable permission. Voro scanned the northern pole to find a clue as to how the Sentinels had jumped fleet-wide, finding that the Sentinels could hone in on the Slipspace destinations, but could not generate Slipspace themselves. After the fleet vaporized what was left of the Sentinels, the ships moved into the planet's atmosphere. There they met with little resistance from the Sentinels and Voro recognized the holy Forerunner scriptures on the walls and ground. Voro ordered
   Y'gar
   to pulse the Greeting of the Ancients, though he doubted there were any Forerunners present. Instead, he picked up a signal from another Covenant ship, the

   . 'Mantakree was able to triangulate the signal of the ship and ordered his Hunter pair to muster the reserves from every ship in the fleet because he was going to lead the assault. When he discovered the
   Core Room Antechamber
   , he ordered all ships to the "OVERARCH" attack pattern and to prepare for an orbital descent.

   Kig-Yar Point Defense Gauntlets
   . Though it was an uncharacteristic order for an Elite commander, it served for the better; Voro needed his troops to be prepared for anything and wanted to give them a better chance of achieving their goal - to not lose Onyx to the Demons as they had lost the first Halo. After a wave of troops was sent in front of him, he led the later attack alongside the second wave. When he reached the peak of the Core Room Antechamber, he found Spartan-051,
   Kurt Ambrose
   , mortally wounded from hand-to-hand combat with a Hunter. He was about to grant the wounded Spartan an honorable death with his
   Energy Sword

   FENRIS Nuclear Warheads
   that Kurt had triggered remotely to protect the remaining
   Spartans
