   Forge is a game mode originally released in Halo 3 designed by Bungie to allow players to customize, save, and share maps for
   Custom Games
   . Forge was originally created to be used by players to make relatively simple changes to maps in order to tweak their gameplay experience. Maps altered in Forge are referred to as

   weapons
   spawns, and the addition of scenery items such as crates, Fusion coils,

   - In Forge, players can add items that aren't available in unmodified maps. Halo 3 players proved so resourceful and imaginative with the tools provided to them that Bungie released two maps created specifically with Forge in mind. The scenery and layouts of these maps are almost entirely composed of movable and removable Forge objects. The

   model (a
   Monitor
   ) by pressing Up on the D-Pad. A variety of Forge-specific settings can be altered by the party leader while in the Forge Lobby. As an example, players in Edit Mode can be granted more (or less) health and shielding as well as varying levels of Active Camouflage—editors can even be granted near or total invulnerability. There is also a setting that, if enabled, prevents all but the party leader from entering Edit Mode. Players can play actual games in Forge, experiment with Forge's features, kill each other, play diverse and varying 'honor rules' games, and do other things that aren't accepted in regular Multiplayer.

   s Forge proved to be very primitive in terms of allowing players to edit maps. This is because Forge was created originally to allow players to make smaller changes to maps; Bungie did not expect so many creative and amazing maps to be created with the tools they provided.

    Restrictions
   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="ba5185c4-8cdc-4f22-97c0-9d36edc3e88f">
   There are some limits when placing items in Forge. The most obvious limit is the set of items permitted in a map—specific items are only allowed in specific maps. As an example,
   <a href="AV-14 Attack VTOL.html" key="dbd5abb8-fe72-4589-8988-e334687426f5" title="AV-14 Attack VTOL">
    Hornets
   </a>
   and
   Scorpions
   cannot be placed in
   The Pit
   , and
   Deployable Covers
   may not be placed in Sandtrap. (The technical explanation is that the
   tags
   for certain objects are only present in certain maps. Bungie likely did not place them for balance issues.) There are also varying limits on how many of each item can be placed; while the player can usually place up to thirty-two
   <a href="M9 High-Explosive Dual-Purpose grenade.html" key="68f4b865-b05a-4285-8159-7c517dc6630d" title="M9 High-Explosive Dual-Purpose grenade">
    frag grenades
   </a>
   , the player can only place two
   Scorpions
   when they are available on a map.
  </p>
  <p key="e5a8fc18-b3d3-449a-850a-505ba8f3bae2">
   The amount of items the player can place in Forge is also regulated by an economy budget system.
   Different objects are assigned to different values. This is to keep the player from
   overloading
   maps and using excessive amounts of memory. Deleting items that are already on the map will free up more money for other items. The spending limit is merely a counter to help the player gauge how much they can place on the map at a given time; no real currency is used. The highest encountered budget is located on the map Sandbox, with a grand total of 1,500 credits. However, using the budget glitch, the player can go beyond the limit set, to do this make the run time maximum one more than the current amount placed on map.
   or they can download canvases with the budget glitch already in.
  </p>
  <p key="2cbfc8b3-71b0-4493-a800-663042198958">
   All maps have a maximum limit of 640 items.
   The 640-item limit behaves somewhat oddly; removing items that are in the map by default does not free up more of the 640 "slots," so when editing large maps like
   <a href="Sandbox.html" key="4d1cd78a-9170-408c-bf23-936164565c60" title="Sandbox">
    Sandbox

   , it is best to move all default items to the side instead of deleting them and trying to replace them when they need them later.

   currently features the most Forge environments out of any Halo game yet. These are:
   Alpine
   ,
   Breakout Arena
   ,
   Glacier
   ,
   Parallax
   ,
   Tidal
   ,
   Barrens
   , and
   Depths
   . All but two maps, Depths and Breakout Arena, have modifiable skyboxes that affect weather and time of day. Parallax and Tidal are the only two maps without a solid, permanent floor. Each map, except Breakout Arena, has a series of objects in the natural section dedicated to each map. Breakout Arena would use props from the Breakout section. There are no restrictions preventing props that are related to a different map, from being placed on another. Meaning the asteroid themed props from Parallax can be placed on Tidal should a player so choose.
Present in the template maps are special pillars, triplets of pillars, and large diamonds designed to remind the player of where the hard-coded kill boundaries are present. They appear only in Forge, but objects can be placed at their positions to substitute them in main games, especially with flying vehicles.
