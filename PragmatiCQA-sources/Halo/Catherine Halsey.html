   as a civilian consultant and brought her to Reach.
   In August of that year, Halsey purchased a small, hardback journal in a shop on
   Reach
   , near the base she was stationed in. Halsey used the journal as a medium through which to express her thoughts and concerns, as well as pen important research notes, and would do so for another forty-two years, until she abandoned it during her escape from

   2553

Dr. Halsey always used their first names, never their ranks or Spartan tags. She had a huge amount of respect for, and from, the Spartans; as their only mother figure, she commanded absolute obedience from her Spartans. Accordingly, she was also privy to the Spartans' closely held secrets, having taught many to them as children, such as the security code,

   In the aftermath of the battle, she was presumed dead by the Office of Naval Intelligence and honoured along with other ONI personnel on a plaque at the

Another possibility is that her name was added to the wall after the Battle of Reach but before the Spartans returned to Earth. It could also be that ONI did not want anyone to know that she had kidnapped Kelly, so they covered up the incident by saying she had died.

Paragosky also informed her about John-117's disappearance and her daughter Miranda's death. Both news, but specially the last one, afftected Catherine greatly. After the shield world is brought into normal space, Kilo-5 was sent in to arrest Halsey for the crimes she had committed (hijacking ships and kidnapping a Spartan).

   sharing worried looks, Halsey confronted the former, accusing of having known the Prometheans' true nature. Lasky admitted that the UNSC has been aware that the Prometheans are ancient humans made into AIs. Halsey corrects that this Promethean is made from a person who lived in New Phoenix. Lasky expressed confusion, as these memories couldn't have gotten from Earth to Requiem. Thorne then abruptly left the room and Halsey realized that he had been staring at an image from the artifact.

  <p key="4d5e895c-e826-4dab-9880-ba42a8844cd0">
   Halsey was then moved to Lasky's ready room, her wrists cuffed. She defended herself, stating that she did not give any information to her contact. Just as she criticized Palmer,
   Roland
   (the ship's AI) informed the Captain that Thorne had been detected alive on Requiem.
  </p>
  <p key="9ed62c93-bd3f-456e-adf3-6e9d8fcff88b">
   After being placed in the brig, Roland asked her why she withheld the truth.  She responded by using an AI override protocol on Roland to escape and gather what information the UNSC had on the Librarian, all of which was her own work, save for a debriefing of
   John-117
   , whom she apparently believed dead after the
   New Phoenix Incident
   . She then got into communication with 'Mdama, offering her assistance to find the Librarian. However, Roland then managed to overcome the override and cut the communication and summoned security. Captain Lasky then confronted Dr. Halsey and planned to place her in cryo, but she slaps him in the face, accusing the Captain of withholding the truth about John-117's survival.  Then suddenly, Promethean Knights began to teleport through the artifact onto the

   Some time after arrival, she meets up with Jul 'Mdama at his base in the Librarian's chamber. After managing to deactivate the shield which, according to her, required a 'more human touch', she runs into the beam which has formed in the Librarian's artifact and disappears. During this time, however, Osman, as the new head of ONI, has ordered Lasky to have Halsey eliminated should she ever be found again. Commander Sarah Palmer then assigns herself the task of eliminating Halsey, much to Lasky's protest.

   When Halsey entered the Shrine, she came face to face with the
   The Librarian
   . The Librarian spoke about how
   Requiem
   's time was coming to an end, and how Halsey must accept her gift so Humanity remains on the path to reclaiming the Mantle. The gift Halsey received was called the
   Janus Key
   , an artifact which was, indeed, a map which showed every piece of Forerunner technology in the galaxy, including all the
   Halo
   installation locations as well as hidden Forerunner technology that could propel Humanity into a new stage of technological supremacy. However, when Halsey accepted the gift, she was launched back into

   Majestic
   was doing there, and when told their mission, she questions why they would save a traitor, to which Thorne attempts to change her opinion by stating why Halsey had thrown him the Key if she was presumably working with 'Mdama.

  <p key="b571b195-9ad4-47d9-8b90-90752c677712">
   Dr. Halsey carried extraordinary guilt because of the SPARTAN-II Program, feeling that she had exploited the children and destroyed their lives, a feeling which was later passed to Cortana. Though she continued to support the Spartans and gained monumental prestige for her efforts, she also felt responsible for each one who died. She never could quite justify their exploitation as a "necessary sacrifice." She also had considerable respect for the Spartans, and addressed them by their first names (even with their armor on), which seemed to greatly annoy them.

  <p key="b4b3d039-5337-430f-9cfd-a66f8ac026e7">
   Her feelings of guilt were made evident by the fact that she often referred mentally to "sacrificing the few to save the many," though this rarely worked to soothe her conscience. By the time she was rescued from Reach by the
   <i key="2b2296ce-49f4-4a7f-9e08-13e935d3a063">

   was not one that the UNSC could possibly win. While she knew that her own Spartans, the Spartan-IIs, couldn't be persuaded to turn from the war, she believed the Spartan-IIIs may not yet have been fully determined to win the war, and she set out to try and weaken their resolve to fight. When she was arrested Halsey allowed herself to be taken without any resistance due to her guilt.

   Halsey also had somewhat of a unique relationship with John-117, much more intense than the one she had with the other Spartans. Some of this may stem from him being the first subject she observed, but she had a great fondness for him and he was her favorite Spartan. Halsey told Cortana she considers him the luckiest and best of the Spartans and also apparently finds him attractive given her reaction to Cortana's comments on that. Halsey was responsible for John's first promotion to Squad Leader as a result of her acknowledging his leadership skills and suggesting it to Mendez. Halsey also had John's full trust and he always did his best to never undermine her authority.

She estimated that there is a billion to one shot that they could have replicated Johnson's condition, but conversely ONI would do it to save Humanity from a greater foe.
   At first, John chose to sacrifice Johnson in order to try and save millions of people out of his duty to protect all of Humanity. However, John reconsidered and eventually destroyed the data due in part to the sacrifice of

   Since the time both meet, despite Halsey's outside cold appearance with him, she appreciated Jacob, and spend months together with him before parted company amicably. Both meet on Reach for the last time the August 12 2552, a meeting she was hoping and dreading, but they parted well. When Halsey knew of Keyes horrific death, through Cortana's memories, she barely closed her eyes and said

   Halsey dearly loved her only daughter, but she was often too busy to see her. Miranda would be raised mostly by her father, due to her mothers busy schedule. Mother and daughter barely spoke in years. Halsey, after the beginning of the Human-Covenant War, used her influence to move Miranda onto a non combat vessel, expecting to protect her. When her daughter was promoted, she invited her mother to the ceremony. Miranda didn't know why her mother was absent from the ceremony. When her daughter was killed, Halsey was trapped in the Shield World known as
   Trevelyan
   . When Admiral Paragosky told her about the loss, Catherine almost fell to her knees. Halsey thought about how she barely knew Miranda, and hadn't seen or spoken to her in years. She regretted this decision greatly.

    After the Fall of Reach, she was declared dead by the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), although no body was found. She was mentioned in a memorial plaque inside the

    This is because
    Admiral Parangosky
    , director of ONI, wanted Halsey to be thought dead, even though she was alive, and under arrest under charges of aiding the enemy, which was a result of her actions after the Fall of Reach, and throughout her life, mainly the way with which she acquired children for the SPARTAN-II Program. Parangosky needed Halsey because of her technical expertise and knowledge of Forerunner technology, as ONI was building the most advanced UNSC warship ever built, the
