   Created in
   100,043 BCE
   , by the
   Ur-Didact
   and the
   Master Builder
   , Mendicant Bias' purpose was the control of all Forerunner defenses, including the fabled Halos, but only under dire emergencies. The Master Builder, without authorization of the Ecumene Council, tasked Mendicant Bias with the interrogation of
   The Captive
   , after its release on
   Charum Hakkor
   following the Halo's test firing, in place of the Lifeworkers due to the
   Master Builder's
   distrust for them. This resulted in a 43-year long discourse where Mendicant Bias attempted
   <span key="99410e2c-6af7-49d6-8a6f-662891f13377" style="font-style: normal;">
    to find exploitable weaknesses of the Flood.
   </span>
   Mendicant Bias was listed missing by the Master Builder before returning to overlook the second testing of the halo on the
   <a href="San'Shyuum.html" key="aba899d3-3f06-42ea-bb08-f9b1096208a9" title="San'Shyuum">
    San'Shyuum
   </a>
   quarantine system.
   Mendicant Bias sent the logs of his interrogation to his Forerunner masters, who apparently never received the transmissions. Eventually, The Captive persuaded Mendicant Bias to abandon the Forerunners and defect to the Flood cause, convincing him that the Forerunners deny the next step of evolution: the Flood.
   The Captive insinuated that by clinging to the legend of the
   <a href="Mantle of Responsibility.html" key="419fa0dc-d4bf-42c8-86f1-4b4a04df0b06" title="Mantle of Responsibility">
    Mantle
   </a>
   , the Forerunners had doomed the
   galaxy
   to eternal stagnation; the only way for the galaxy to progress was for superior beings to "restart" it. These superior beings, unsurprisingly, took the form of Compound Minds such as Gravemind and Mendicant Bias himself. Although the 43-year long conversation logs between Mendicant Bias and The Captive were sent back to the Forerunners, they believed that Mendicant would automatically fulfill its objective and destroy The Flood, and so did not intervene.
   Convinced by The Captive's arguments, Mendicant Bias intentionally became
   rampant
   , developed a hatred for his creators and actively worked toward their destruction, starting with using five of the original twelve Halos to attack the Forerunner capital. The remaining seven returned to the Ark along with Bornstellar-Makes-Eternal-Lasting, the Councilor Splendid Dust of Ancient Suns, and the Warrior Servant Glory of a Far Dawn.
   Mendicant Bias is potentially the first known victim of the Flood Logic-Plague, to which AI were particularly vulnerable.

   The now rampant Mendicant then attacked with a fleet of over five million ships and completely obliterated the
   Maginot Sphere
   ,
   and forced the Forerunners to accelerate work on the
   Halo Array
   . In order to give them time to complete the Halos' work, the Forerunners created another AI,
   Offensive Bias
   , to slow Mendicant Bias' advance. Offensive Bias lacked Mendicant's creativity, but was more methodically lethal and engineered to take advantage of the parculiarities of Mendicant and it's ranpancy-enduced, single-minded hatred. Offensive Bias' only purpose was to prevent Mendicant Bias from accessing
   <a href="Installation 00.html" key="f83b4d6c-c4a6-4499-88ac-fc1d6efb5657" title="Installation 00">

   Halo Array
   .
  </p>
  <p key="3856be24-fd3e-4abf-b6ab-d44272c4ef68">
   Possibly being unable to find or deduce the locations of the Halos themselves, the only chance Mendicant had to the Array was to secure the Ark and stop the firing sequence directly. While he did not know the location of the Ark, he was aware of a method to reach it via the
   <a href="The Artifact.html" key="de029b21-38af-4055-9a94-48b4393eceaa" title="The Artifact">
    portals
   </a>
   and
   Key Ships
   . The Forerunners subsequently destroyed or disabled most of the keyships to stall Mendicant's assault. However, Mendicant Bias managed to locate (or thought he had located) one of the remaining keyships; this allowed Offensive Bias to predict where Mendicant would breach the Maginot Sphere and the site of their battle. Mendicant's fatal mistake was that he had come to hold the Forerunners in abject contempt — his rampancy clouded his perceptions, such that he failed to anticipate the possibility of facing another AI. Mendicant focused on attacking and converting crewed ships in Offensive's fleet and failed to notice the other AI's careful maneuvering to destroy Mendicants autonomously contolled core warships. When the Halo Effect reached the battle, the majority of Mendicants naval power was rendered useless while it's opponent retained the majority of its remaining fleet, leaving the outcome of the battle certain. Mendicant Bias was outsmarted and
   defeated
   by Offensive Bias who used many of the now crewless ships as explosive triggers, aggressively pushing Mendicant back now that it's ships did not have to account for the survival of its biological crews.

   In order to prevent Mendicant from subverting or harming him, Offensive Bias broke the Compound Mind of Mendicant Bias into its component sections and scattered them throughout the few remaining ships of his fleet for transport. Only a part of Mendicant made it to the Ark, where it was entombed by the last of the Forerunners with a single thought allowed to it: repentance.
