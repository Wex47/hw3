   Captain Keyes was born on Earth and spent some time around the
   Pacific Ocean
   during his early childhood. At some point in his life he read
   work
   by
   Elias Carver
   , but considered his view of the situation in the colonies to be pessimistic. Keyes attended Officer Candidate School (OCS). During his second year of training, an incident occurred where fourteen ensigns were killed due to an instructor's error during a poorly planned test. Keyes suffered

   burns during the test and had to be rehabilitated in a hospital for two months. Keyes refused to testify against the instructor and was nearly demoted for it. Keyes' refusal to testify is what sparked Catherine Halsey's interest in the then Lieutenant Junior Grade Keyes.

   project. Keyes was chosen by Halsey for this assignment partly because he could "keep a secret." In order to fool anybody who was suspicious, they told them that they were looking for a school for their daughter, and so they both began observing the chosen subjects for the program. The first child they observed was SPARTAN-II subject 117, or
   John-117
   . Later, he expressed doubts when Halsey actually let
   Soren-066
   choose whether he wanted to become a Spartan, saying it was an "awful lot to lay on a child, even one who's grown up so fast."
   Keyes never forgot this assignment or the names of any of the children.

   Early in the Human-Covenant war, he became a widely known hero when he led a small group of security troops against the Covenant ambush of the frigate

   He later toured on the Stealth
   Frigate

   Charybdis IX

   Keyes was often quite officious, overly formal and put the safety of the UNSC before his own personal safety, even going as far as to almost self-destruct the ship he was on so that the Covenant wouldn't find Earth. He was prepared and willing to give anything for Earth. He would often charge headlong into battle keeping a straight and calm face whether fighting alongside his men on the ground or
   in space
   . As a captain, Keyes expected the best from his Marines by maintaining their morale even through hopeless situations. This was seen when he silenced one Marine for panicking when there was no available escape route in the

   and when he angrily ordered
   Private Mendoza
   to resume his position when the latter was attempting to flee from their first encounter of the Flood. Keyes was also known to be fearless in most situations, as he refused to tell
   Zuka 'Zamamee
   about John-117, and even dared the Sangheili to kill him. He had a strong will as he prevented the proto-gravemind from discovering the location of Earth, when he was consumed by the Flood.
