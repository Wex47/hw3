   It is possible that Article 2 governs protocol in terms of abandoning a vessel. Article 2 could be theorized to mandate the removal, not destruction, of a shipboard AI if the ship in question will still be intact and its crew is able to protect the AI in question. This does seem to contradict Article 5 of the Cole Protocol, which states that ships in danger of being overtaken by Covenant forces must self-destruct.

As such, its usage is universal - from warships, to freighters, to even stationary space stations in inertial orbit. For structures that are incapable of leading Covenant forces to a colony, the purging of their navigational data banks is still mandatory, and self-destruct options exist to prevent the capture of any remaining data or crew.

    Statistically, enough jumps from enough ships could be used to see which direction ships *don't* jump towards as often, and then use that as triangulation effort. In WW2, many tactics were used to 'hide' these statistical effects that could give intelligence about a protocol in effect, including 'giving away' select (real or artificial) locations of bases, ships etc. as decoys to balance out the statistics. Although, due to the immense nature of space, such statistics would take a monumental amount of time and battles to gather. Though this strategy may have lead the Covenant to a few human worlds.
