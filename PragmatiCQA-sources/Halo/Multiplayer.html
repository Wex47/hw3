   was redone in order to balance out Matchmaking even further. The
   system was still present on ranked playlists, but a new "Experience (EXP)" stat was added to player profiles. Whenever a player plays a match without quitting and is in a top position or on a winning team, the player gains 1 EXP. Players who enter a playlist, but disconnect or quit early lose 1 EXP for desertion. Players also lose EXP for losing games. In theory, this helps with player matching and balance by finding players who have been playing the game as much as you have based on their EXP level.
