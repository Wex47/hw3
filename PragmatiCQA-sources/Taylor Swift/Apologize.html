    I'm so glad you made time to see me
    How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
    I haven't seen them in a while
    You've been good, busier than ever
    We small talk, work and the weather
    Your guard is up, and I know why
    Because the last time you saw me
    Is still burned in the back of your mind
    You gave me roses, and I left them there to die
    So this is me swallowing my pride
    Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
    And I go back to December all the time
    It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
    Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
    I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
    I go back to December all the time
    These days, I haven't been sleeping
    Staying up, playing back myself leaving
    When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
    Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
    I watched you laughing from the passenger side
    And realized I loved you in the fall
    And then the cold came, the dark days
    When fear crept into my mind
    You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye
    So this is me swallowing my pride
    Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
    And I go back to December all the time
    It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
    Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
    I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
    I go back to December all the time
    I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
    So good to me, so right
    And how you held me in your arms that September night
    The first time you ever saw me cry
    Maybe this is wishful thinking
    Probably mindless dreaming
    But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
    I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
    So if the chain is on your door, I understand
    And then he said it's too late to apologise
    It's too late
    He said it's too late to apologise
    It's too late
    And I said, this is me swallowing my pride
    Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
    (It's too late to apologise)
    And I go back to December all the time
    It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
    Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
    (It's too late to apologise)
    He said you're not sorry
    No, no, no
    You're not sorry
    No, no, no
    You're not sorry
    No, no, no
    You're not sorry
    No, no, no
