   . Throughout its early years, it gained the reputation of being legendary for its "serious and hard-hitting journalism." This public opinion would later shift the tides, with management trying to appeal to younger teens to gain more sales. This idea, however, was put to shame in the 2010s with falsified stories.

   In 2016, the now sole founder, Wenner, decided to switch management, giving it to BandLab Technologies at a 49% stake of the company. Penske Media decided to acquire the remaining stakes of 51% from Wenner, and would later in 2019 also buy BandLab's which would give full ownership.
