   </b>
   is a Swedish music streaming service. It was founded by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon in 2006 as a response to rapt illegal music file sharing. However, it wouldn't go public until October 2008 after Ek had pleaded with major record labels to open catalogs and allow buying at a 20% stake. As of the third quarter of 2021, they have 381 million total users with 172 of those choosing to pay for premium,
   making them the biggest subscribed streaming service.

It was first released on Apple Music and its subsidiary iTunes, but when it eventually came to Spotify, it was never released on any playlists.

   The second allegation was brought forth by Music Business Worldwide saying that they had paid producers to create tracks which they would take the masters from - only paying for the tracks.

   Due to the multiple cases shown between 2012 and 2017, it was quickly decided the following year that Spotify would settle, paying over $43 million in damages. Although Spotify disagreed saying it believed "factual and legal allegations…are incorrect."
   Any songwriter not under National Music Publishers’ Association (NPMA) who had their music uploaded, and contends Spotify did so without a license, was eligible to be reimbursed.
