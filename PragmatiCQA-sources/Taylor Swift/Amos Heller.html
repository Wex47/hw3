   He received his first electric bass when he was thirteen, and like most other thirteen-year-olds, joined a band that knew a few songs. Throughout high school, and college he played any genre of music that would have him, going from top 40 cover bands to Frank Zappa-inspired rock to Christian worship to small-combo jazz.
