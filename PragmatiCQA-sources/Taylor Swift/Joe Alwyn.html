   Early 2017, Taylor wrote about their relationship in a journal: "I'm essentially based in London, hiding out trying to protect us from the nasty world that just wants to ruin things. We have been together and no one has found out for 3 months now. I want it to stay that way because I don't want anything about this to change." The journal was released in 2019.

   , which is presumably about Joe. In the song, she sings “Some boys are tryin’ too hard, he don’t try at all though / Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so”. Joe is younger than her previous two boyfriends, Calvin and Tom. The lyrics "No one has to know" could refer to Taylor and Joe keeping their relationship private. On Tumblr, Taylor liked a post of a fan explaining how the lyrics refers to Joe. The music video also has references to Joe: The number 91 appeared, which could refer to Joe's birthyear 1991. Taylor also typed the number 21 on a keypad, which could refer to Joe's birthday, February 21.

This isn’t a secret. She wanted us to tell people.” In the song, Taylor sings "You should take it as a compliment / That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk". Joe is British and has a British accent, which is probably what Taylor was making fun of. She also sings "Ocean-blue eyes lookin' in mine": Joe has blue eyes.
