   Swift became inspired to write "You Belong with Me" after she overheard a male friend of hers speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call.
   He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled at him, and said to her, "No, baby...I had to get off the phone really quickly... I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry."
   Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song.
   In a writing session with co-writer
   <a href="Liz Rose.html" key="435ea2c0-445a-43c8-b8e3-6c2c74dec698" title="Liz Rose">

   </a>
   , Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, "You’re on the phone with your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said."
   Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to breakup with his current girlfriend for her.
   Swift described the song's concept as "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like this guy who you have for your whole life, and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time."
   Swift recalled, "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts'."
   "You Belong with Me" was first released as a promotional single from

   It follows the chord progression G♭–D♭–A♭m-C♭.

   The lyrics to "You Belong with Me" alternate between narrative modes, where she speaks of herself, a male friend whom she has an unrequited crush on, and his girlfriend. Greenblatt described Swift's role as a storyteller, the song being a narrative set to music, which describes concerning about love and boys "just [being] very hard to catch".

   believes "You Belong with Me"'s plot is "confessional" and regards scenarios themed with high school, while Swift "is the girl next door who's had her heart broken and takes refuge in music".
   Lucy Davies of the BBC noted, "Swift deals in the prosaic imagery of high school boys".
   In one verse, Swift contrasts herself with her friend's girlfriend and states, "She wears high heels, I wear sneakers / She's cheer captain, I'm on the bleachers", which Davies interpreted as the song's protagonist feeling envy towards cheerleaders, in particular, the one dating her male friend.
   In the choruses, Swift attempts "to persuade some boy to come to his senses and submit to her every girl charms".

   She opined that "You Belong with Me"'s "lyrical palette has few colours [...] and it's repetitive".

   "You Belong with Me"s accompanying music video was directed by Roman White. In the video, Swift portrays both the protagonist and antagonist, which she respectively described as "the nerd, who is pining away for this guy that she can't have" and "the popular girl."
   Swift described the popular girl's persona as "horrible and scary and intimidating and perfect".
   Her love interest is portrayed by American actor Lucas Till; Swift met Till while acting on the set of

   in April 2008. She later asked him to act in the video, as she was intrigued by his "cool look", embodying a "dreamy guy".
   In regards to his acting on the video, Swift said, "He's absolutely perfect for the part and really fun to be around, too."
   According to her, the video's plot is "charming"; she also said that, "the whole video, I'm just sitting there pining away, wishing I could be in her position."
   In regards to the video's conclusion, White explained that Swift "becomes who she really is", while Swift thought it was a happy ending.
   Swift commented, "One of my favorite things about this video is that there wasn't a standard performance scene. This video was pretty much all story line and I'm narrating it in the moment, basically narrating while all this is happening around me."
  </p>
  <p key="2e56a3bf-052e-4ae3-9ecc-56ac6648c998">
   The video was shot in two days between Gallatin, Tennessee and Hendersonville, Tennessee.
   On the first day of filming, Swift used a body double in order for both Swift, as the protagonist and antagonist, to appear in one shot.
   In a scene where she appeared dancing, White replaced Swift's routine with a one having no rhythm; she recalled, "It was some of the most fun I'd had in a long time, just freaking out and doing the dumbest moves."
   On the second day, they first filmed a prom scene and, lastly, the football game, both being filmed at Pope John Paul II High School. The school supplied many students as extras, including football players, band members, cheerleaders and students for the final prom scene. When filming for a touchdown, Till was unable to catch the ball, furthering the length of the shoot.
   "You put a lot of good solid effort in it and it looks good", Swift stated about filming.
  </p>
  <p key="ec177f85-76a9-45e4-a0d6-0269d09b3eb9">
   The video commences with Till arguing with his girlfriend through a phone call. As soon as Swift, as the protagonist, notices, they begin to communicate by holding up signs through their bedroom windows. Till closes his curtains, and Swift holds up a sign saying, "I love you". As the song's chorus approaches, Swift starts to sing and dance in front of a mirror, changing to different clothing multiple times. Afterward, Swift is sitting in a bench while reading a book. Till arrives and the two converse. Then, Swift, as the antagonist, arrives in a red convertible car and Till gets in it; Swift, as the antagonist, kisses him and gives a vicious look towards the protagonist. Suddenly, she is seen cheerleading at a football game while Swift's other persona is in the bleachers, performing in the school band. After scoring the winning touchdown, Till moves toward his girlfriend and finds her flirting with a teammate; meanwhile, Swift, as the protagonist, stares in amazement. Back in their bedroom windows, they again communicate through signs, Till asked Swift, as the protagonist, if she was attending prom and she responded, "no, studying". Shortly after, Swift is seen entering prom with a white dress, no longer looking like a nerd, while all her peers stare in amazement. When Till spots her, he walks towards her and Swift, as the antagonist, attempts to impede him, but he ignores her. Ending the video, Till and Swift reveal folded signs saying "I love you" and kiss.
