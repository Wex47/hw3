   Many fans quickly came up with the theory that the pseudonym William Bowery refers to Joe Alwyn. The name of Joe's great grandfather was William Alwyn, who also happened to be a musician. Bowery would refer to the Bowery Hotel, where Joe and Taylor were spotted around the time they started dating.
