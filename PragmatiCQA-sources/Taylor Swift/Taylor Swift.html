    Taylor Alison Swift
   </b>
   (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, actress, music video director, philanthropist, and businesswoman. Her discography spans multiple genres and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise.
  </p>
  <p key="2244045a-19a9-4796-b343-3e26e9c78119">
   Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording deal with Big Machine Records in 2005 and released her eponymous debut studio album in 2006. She explored country pop on her second and third studio albums,

   (2008) and

   </i>
   (2010). The success of the former's singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" on both country and pop radio established Swift as a leading crossover artist. She experimented further with pop, rock, and electronic genres on her fourth studio album,
   <i key="9748cc4a-a8f2-48f2-98b6-0b1122cddb44">

   (2012). Her fifth, the synth-pop album

   <i key="bb222dba-a463-46fe-bb1d-90f77e845881">
    Billboard
   </i>
   Hot 100 number-one singles "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". The media scrutiny on her personal life that followed largely inspired Swift's sixth studio album,

   Taylor Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania, and raised in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania.
   She is the daughter of

   She grew up on a Christmas-tree farm.
  </p>
  <p key="b0ac77d8-9e2a-466f-a5b1-8ef6d59c2bb4">
   When Swift was in fourth grade, she won a national poetry contest with a three-page poem, "Monster in My Closet".
   At the age of ten, a computer repairman showed her how to play three chords on a guitar, sparking her interest in learning the instrument. Afterward, Swift wrote her first song, "
   <a href="Lucky You.html" key="426d14d0-0113-4f97-a6c7-2b0580affe00" title="Lucky You">
    Lucky You
   </a>
   ".
   When Swift was 12, she devoted an entire summer to writing a 350-page novel, which remains unpublished.
   She began writing songs regularly and used it as an outlet to help her with her pain from not fitting in at school. Swift was a victim of bullying, and spent her time writing songs to express her emotions.
   She also started performing at local karaoke contests, festivals, and fairs.
  </p>
  <p key="22852fb4-c31e-4c51-aae4-0723ca441425">
   Swift began to regularly visit Nashville, Tennessee, and work with local songwriters. When she was 14, her family relocated to Nashville.
   Her first major show was a well-received performance at the Bloomsburg Fair.
   In Tennessee, Swift attended Hendersonville High School, but was subsequently homeschooled for her junior and senior years. In 2008, she earned her high school diploma.
  </p>
  <p key="b3efabc7-c1fa-4314-b21e-2b52c9eeb39d">
   Swift's greatest musical influence is Shania Twain.
   Her other influences include LeAnn Rimes, Tina Turner, Dolly Parton, and Swift's grandmother. Although her grandmother was a professional opera singer,
   Swift's tastes always leaned more toward country music. In her younger years, she developed a love for Patsy Cline and Dolly Parton.
   She also credits the Dixie Chicks for demonstrating the impact that one can have by "stretching boundaries".

   At age 12, Swift made her first trip to Nashville, hoping to obtain a record deal by distributing a demo tape of her singing with karaoke songs. She gave a copy to every label in town,
   but was rejected.
   After Swift returned to Pennsylvania, she was asked to sing at the U.S. Open tennis tournament, where her rendition of the national anthem received much attention.
  </p>
  <p key="bae89400-7dfb-4fff-baf6-8a902b769792">
   When Swift was 15, she rejected RCA Records because the company wanted to keep her on an artist development deal.

   Swift's fourth studio album, Red, was released in October 2012. She wrote nine of the album's sixteen songs alone. The remaining seven were co-written with Max Martin, Liz Rose, Dan Wilson, Ed Sheeran and Gary Lightbody. Nathan Chapman served as the album's lead producer but Jeff Bhasker, Butch Walker, Jacknife Lee, Dann Huff and Shellback also produced individual tracks. Chapman has said he encouraged Swift "to branch out and to test herself in other situations". Musically, while there is experimentation with heartland rock, dubstep and dance-pop, it is "sprinkled among more recognisably Swiftian fare". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times placed Red at number two on his end-of-year list, characterizing it as the album on which Swift "stops pretending she’s anything but a pop megastar, one with grown-up concerns, like how two bodies speak to each other and how taste in records can be a stand-in for moral turpitude."

   remarked: "From late-night monologues, to the kids on 4chan, her breakups have become her defining characteristic and easiest detraction ... There are some obvious reasons; she's young, she can be contentiously dramatic, she puts herself in the center of her stories, and obviously she's dated a lot of famous people in a relatively short amount of time. But none of that is exceptionally rare -- pop-stars have lead [sic] vogue, ecumenical lifestyles for a long time ... It should be a little bit uncomfortable that Swift's earnestness can be so easily discredited when plenty of other, more egregious songwriters are let off the hook ... It's really easy to dismiss a blonde girl trying to play by the rules."

   In August 2017, Swift successfully sued David Mueller, a former morning show personality for Denver's KYGO-FM. Four years earlier, Swift had informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event. After being fired, Mueller accused Swift of lying and sued her for damages from his loss of employment. Shortly after, Swift counter-sued for sexual assault. The jury rejected Mueller's claims and ruled in favor of Swift. Swift thereafter cleared her social media accounts and then released "

   Swift's lyrics are highly autobiographical; she has said that "If you listen to my albums, it’s like reading my diary."
   For example, the song "Forever &amp; Always" was inspired by her relationship with Joe Jonas,
   while the song "
   <a href="Hey Stephen.html" key="2d4e1723-359c-4a85-a470-eb9099ac3c55" title="Hey Stephen">
    Hey Stephen
   </a>
   " was written about a boy whom she toured with in the past.
   "Fifteen" was written about her freshman year of high school. It has been said that her lyrics "can be tinged with acid: the quiet loner girl getting one over on the cheerleaders, or a caustic payback for the boy who dumped her."
   She has also indicated that she tries to write so her fans can relate to the lyrics, saying "My goal is to never write songs that my fans can't relate to."
   She parodied her confrontational style of songwriting during her appearance on
   <i key="c4a4b582-8d8c-46c0-986a-ba13775b70e4">
    Saturday Night Live

   ; during her opening monologue, she performed an original song that featured lines such as "You might think I'd bring up Joe, that guy who broke up with me on the phone/ Hey, Joe, I'm doing real well, tonight I'm hosting 'SNL'" referring to her highly publicized relationship with Joe Jonas.
  </p>
  <p key="7456d7f6-d95b-4612-ae21-27a4c1f8e1f9">
   The intensely personal nature of the songs has drawn her attention in the music industry. Swift once said, "I thought people might find them hard to relate to, but it turned out that the more personal my songs were, the more closely people could relate to them."
   Due to the autobiographical nature of her songs, some fans have researched the songs' origins. Swift once said, "Every single one of the guys that I’ve written songs about has been tracked down on MySpace by my fans."
