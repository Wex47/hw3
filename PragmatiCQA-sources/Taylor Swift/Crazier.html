   came about after filmmakers approached Swift about using her music in the film. Film officials emailed her asking for a song "that was perfect to fall in love to" and "sort of a country waltz".
   Although it was not written intentionally for the film, Swift sent in "Crazier" and the filmmakers "loved it".
   In addition, Swift offered to perform the song in the film herself as a cameo appearance. In the film, Swift performs at an open mic fundraiser to save a small town's treasured park from developers.
   The quick scene was filmed in a single day, but Swift's performance impressed film members. Film director Peter Chelsom said, "I've made a very big mental check to work with her again".

   She complimented it for being "more genuine, more effortless, than any of [Cyrus'] or Hannah's tracks".
