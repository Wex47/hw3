   At a meet-and-greet photo session at a Pepsi Center back in June 2013,
   <a href="Taylor Swift.html" key="eda20d42-fade-436a-af08-d2e5b0953fea" title="Taylor Swift">
    Taylor Swift
   </a>
   was the victim of being groped by radio host David Mueller. After the incident, Mueller lost his job, and sued Taylor in response.

   August 14, 2017, after six days in court, and hours of deliberation, a jury found him guilty.

  <p key="f46fe7cc-5a8b-4656-94c9-be56467eef7a">
   He had sued Swift claiming her accusations cost him his job, she then filed this civil suit against him and won, forcing him to pay one dollar. The symbolism behind the single dollar was to show that Taylor wanted justice for those who were not able to speak out about their own assault experiences.
