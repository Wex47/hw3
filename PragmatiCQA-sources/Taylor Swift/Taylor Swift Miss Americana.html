  <p key="dfee7b1f-7567-4894-be6d-351980148f65">
   A teenage country-music prodigy who evolved into a pop star, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift wins countless awards, fills stadium tours with rapturous fans, and continues to reinvent herself—all while maintaining her autonomy as an artist. Her megacelebrity leaves her personal life very public; every relationship and every feud is fodder for her haters on social media. After achieving so much in so little time, Swift is now at a crossroads in her career. Notably apolitical in the past, Swift, as a young American woman at this time, in this country, is motivated to address injustice and inequality in a way she never has, and she is emboldened to speak out for herself and what she believes in.
  </p>
  <p key="06ccea85-292f-4107-9c84-f3af928c6a95">
   Director Lana Wilson (After Tiller, 2013 Sundance Film Festival) offers a multifaceted window into Swift, her creative process, and her singular experience of being a star of this magnitude. With a skillful touch, Wilson accesses Swift’s vulnerability and sensitivity, fierce intelligence and wit, and reflective moments with her Scottish Fold kitties as she embarks on the latest chapter of her already extraordinary career.

In the apology, Glaser stated that: "Unfortunately, I am featured in her [Swift's] new documentary as part of a montage of asshats saying mean things about her, which is used to explain why she felt the need to escape from the spotlight for a year", and admitted that her comments may have come from a place of "projection". She further added that "if you're familiar with my 'work' at all, you know I talk openly about battling some kind of eating disorder for the past 17 years, I was probably 'feeling fat' that day and was jealous". Swift responded: "One of the major themes of the doc is that we have the ability to change our opinions over time, to grow, to learn about ourselves. I'm so sorry to hear that you've struggled with some of the same things I've struggled with. Sending a massive hug".
