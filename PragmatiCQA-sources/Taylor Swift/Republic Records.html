   Both the brothers had previously worked for labels, with Republic Records initially being a hobby of theirs. At the time of the start-up in 2005, they named it "Cheese Factory", and was a subsidiary of the Greffen Records umbrella owned by UMG. KRDQ radio station was the first station to ever airplay any record of theirs with Bloodhound Gang's "Fire Water Burn". Soon after, however, they would change distribution to Universal Records under a multi-year deal with vice-chairperson Mel Lewinter in 2000.

   Monte went to Universal Records to be chairperson of their group in 2001, while Avery remained as president of Republic Records. In 2006, Monte would go back to being president, but this time of Universal Motown Republic Records. This was because Universal had merged itself, including Motown Records with Republic.
