Swift wrote the song about interrupting a wedding, after conversing with her friend, whose ex-boyfriend would soon wed to someone else, and having a dream about one of her own ex-boyfriends marrying another girl. The song relies on acoustic guitar and is narrated from the perspective of a person who crashes her former love's wedding in attempt to win him back.

       This song was inspired by one of my friends who was telling me about her childhood sweetheart, crush guy. They were kind of together in high school and went their separate ways, and it was kind of understood that they were gonna get back together. Then, she one day comes in and tells me he's getting married. He had met this girl who was just this mean person who made him completely stop talking to all of his friends, cut off his family, had him like so completely isolated. And I just, kind of randomly, was like, "So, you gonna speak now?" She was like, "What do you mean?" And I was like "Oh, you know, like storm the church, speak now or forever hold your peace? I'll go with you. I'll play guitar. It would be great." She was just kind of laughing, and later on I just was wrapping my mind around that idea of how tragic it would be if someone you loved was marrying somebody else.

       Later I had a dream about one of my ex-boyfriends getting married, and it just all came together that I needed to write this song about interrupting a wedding. For me, I like to think of it as good versus evil, and this girl is so completely painted as the evil one. So this is "Speak Now."

   "Speak Now" was written by Swift, as were all the tracks for the album.
   The song was inspired by one of Swift's dear friends and the story of she and her high school sweetheart. The couple went their separate ways after high school — with the idea that they would get back together. Swift acknowledged that she thought it was inevitable for them to reunite. One day, Swift's friend informed Swift that her high school sweetheart would soon wed. "He had met this girl who's just this horrible, mean person who made him completely stop talking to all of his friends, cut off his family. She had him so completely isolated,"
   says Swift. She asked her friend if she would "speak now." Perplexed, her friend asked for an explanation, and she answered, "You know, storm the church. 'Speak now or forever hold your peace.' I'll go with you. I'll play guitar. It'd be great."
   Swift's friend found this to be humorous, laughing at the idea.
  </p>
  <p key="ee4077a8-033c-443b-bbf7-74b11feea1d3">
   After speaking with her friend, Swift became deeply fixated on the idea of how tragic it would be for the person one loved to wed someone else. That night, Swift experienced a dream where one of her own ex-boyfriends married another girl. To her, this signaled that she had to compose a song about interrupting a wedding. In retrospection, she concluded, "For me, I like to think of it as good versus evil. And this girl is just completely — just the evil one."
   Swift entitled the album after "Speak Now" because it fit the album's concept, each song being a different confession to a person, well.
   "It's called
   <i key="d5461e42-42db-4304-9ed3-4ffd3419928d">
    Speak Now
   </i>
   , and that pertains to the album as a concept and as an entire theme of the record more than I can even tell you", she said.
   A 30-second clip of the song was previewed on Comcast's Xfinitytv.com on October 4, 2010.
   "Speak Now" was released as a promotional single from

       Real life is a funny thing you know. In real life, saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial. So crucial, in fact, that most of us start to hesitate - for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. But lately, what I've begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything. I think you deserve to look back on your life without this chorus of resounding voices saying 'I could've. But it's too late now'. So there's a time for silence, and there's a time for waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel and you so clearly know what you need to say, you'll know it. I don't think you should wait. I think you should speak now.

   Swift's vocals begin in a hushed tone, gradually turn grow, and at one point belt the song's title.
   The song features different twangy, up-and-down vocal hooks might, in similarity to "

   In the lyrics of "Speak Now", Swift narrates about crashing her former love's wedding in attempt to win him back.
   The opening lines acknowledge that, although out of character, Swift still in love with her ex-boyfriend and wants to make sure he does not marry the wrong girl. Throughout the song's verses, Swift sneaks in the wedding and describes her observations, such as the bride-to-be's bearing of a poofy wedding gown, her cumulative family, and an organist playing "Bridal Chorus".
   In "Speak Now"'s refrains, Swift pleads her ex-boyfriend to not say his vows in order to run away with her.
   The bridge has Swift responding to the priest's calling of "Speak now or forever hold your peace" before repeating the opening lines. The last refrain is altered to tell that the groom and Swift indeed run away together.
