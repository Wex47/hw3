   (2008), co-produced by Nathan Chapman. Swift wrote the song about a love interest who was not popular among her family and friends. Because of the scenario, she related to the plot of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597) and used it as a source of inspiration to compose the song, but replaced the play's original tragic conclusion with a happy ending. "Love Story" is a midtempo country pop song with dreamy soprano vocals and a continually building melody. Its lyrics are from the perspective of Juliet.
