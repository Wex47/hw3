I wanted a story that could work in the form of a song and I called my co-writer Liz Rose and said, ‘Come over, we’ve gotta filter this down,’ and it took me a really long time to get it."

    Oh your sweet disposition
         And my wide-eyed gaze
         We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
         The autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
         And I can picture it after all these days
         And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
         And I might be okay but I’m not fine at all
         'Cause there we are again on that little town street
         You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin’ over at me
         Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well
         Photo album on the counter
         Your cheeks were turning red
         You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
         And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team
         You tell me about your past thinking your future was me
         And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
         And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
         'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
         We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
         Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well
         Yeah
         Well maybe we got lost in translation
         Maybe I asked for too much
         But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
         'Till you tore it all up
         Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
         Hey you called me up again just to break me like a promise
         So casually cruel in the name of being honest
         I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
         'Cause I remember it all, all, all, too well
         Time won't fly
         It's like I’m paralyzed by it
         I'd like to be my old self again but I’m still trying to find it
         After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
         Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
         But you keep my old scarf
         From that very first week
         'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
         You can't get rid of it
         'Cause you remember it all too well
         'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
         Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
         It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
         Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
