       "Back to December" addresses a first for me, in that I've never apologized to someone in a song before. In the good, or bad, or the apology, the person I wrote the song for deserves this. This is about somebody who was incredible to me, just perfect to me in a relationship, and I was really careless with him, so these are the words that I would say to him -- that he deserves to hear.

   According to Swift, "Back to December" is an apology to a former lover in the form of a song, something that she has never done before.
   She continued, "I've never felt the need to apologize in a song before. But in the last two years I've experienced a lot, [including] a lot of different kinds of learning lessons. And sometimes you learn a lesson too late and at that point you need to apologize because you were careless."
   Based on the lyrics, critics have speculated that the song is Swift's apology to her ex-boyfriend,

   The song's narrative is in first person, and depicts Swift apologizing to a young man whose heart she broke. Lyrically, it is about somebody who was incredible and perfect to her in a relationship. However, she was really careless with him hence the break-up. Therefore, the lyrics are the words that she would say to him that he deserves to hear.

   describes the song as "a melancholy mea culpa with the kind of driving chorus and age-appropriate yet universal honesty",
   adding that "in the tune [...] she says she’s sorry for the last time he saw her (“You gave me roses, and I left them there to die”) and that she wishes she realized what she had (“I’d go back to December, turn around, and change my own mind/I go back to December all the time”).
