   ) is a fusion genre of
   country music
   and
   pop music
   that was developed by members of the country genre out of a desire to reach a larger, mainstream audience. Country pop music blends genres like rock, pop, and country, continuing similar efforts that began in the late 1950s, known originally as
   Nashville sound
   and later on as
   Countrypolitan
   . By the mid-1970s, many country artists were transitioning to the pop-country sound, which led to some records' charting high on mainstream
   top 40
   as well as the
   <i key="f16ab2e4-561d-46d7-96fb-35edb06906fc">
    Billboard
   </i>
   country chart. In-turn, many pop and
   easy listening
   artists crossed over to country charts during this time. After declining in popularity during the
   neotraditional
   movement of the 1980s, country pop had a comeback in the 1990s with a sound that drew more heavily on
   pop rock
   and
   adult contemporary
   .

   The joining of country and pop began in the 1950s when studio executives
   Chet Atkins
   and
   Owen Bradley
   wanted to create a new kind of music for the young adult crowd after "rockabilly stole away much of country music's youth audience".
   According to Bill Ivey, this innovative genre originated in
   Nashville, Tennessee
   and thus became known as the
   Nashville Sound
   . He believes that the "Nashville Sound often produced records that sounded more pop than country, after the removal of the fiddle and banjo. Patsy Cline, Jim Reeves, and Eddy Arnold were among the most popular artists during this time.
   The famous male artists to come out of this genre were Marty Robbins,
   Jim Reeves
   and
   Eddy Arnold
   . Both Reeves and Arnold had major influence on their RCA labelmate
   Elvis Presley
   , apparent not only in secular songs, but even more so in
   country gospel
   songs.
   Patsy Cline
   was a famous female country singer in the early 1960s. Skeeter Davis "The End of the World", Sonny James "Young Love", Jenny C.Riley "Harper Valley P.T.A.", and
   Bobby Goldsboro
   "Honey"
   were 60s pop country hits. Even though Cline also gained widespread acceptance from country and pop audiences alike, the Nashville Sound was not well received by country purists, and faced competition, first from the
   Bakersfield Sound
   and later the
   outlaw movement
   on that front; on the pop side, the format was overshadowed by the
   British Invasion
   , which was taking place during the same time that Cline and Reeves died by airplane accident.

   Country pop started when pop music singers like
   Glen Campbell
   ,
   John Denver
   ,
   Olivia Newton-John
   , and
   Anne Murray
   (Canada), began having hits on the country charts. Songs like Campbell's "
   Rhinestone Cowboy
   " was a crossover hit between the pop and country charts.
   Rhinestone Cowboy was produced by blue-eyed soul writer team Dennis Lambert &amp; Brian Potter and written by Larry Weiss. Denver's single "
   Take Me Home, Country Roads
   "  went to No. 2 on the
   <i key="cebfb460-e68e-470d-b129-ee0a99991db5">
    Billboard
   </i>
   charts.  Denver's career flourished from then on, and he had a series of hits over the next four years. In 1972, Denver scored his first Top Ten album with
   <i key="173c265e-991d-49e6-a57c-e39d39291bad">
    Rocky Mountain High
   </i>
   , with its title track reaching the Top Ten in 1973.
   In 1974 and 1975, Denver had a string of four No. 1 songs ("
   Sunshine on My Shoulders
   ," "
   Annie's Song
   ," "
   Thank God I'm a Country Boy
   ," "
   I'm Sorry
   ") and two No. 1 albums (

   </i>
   . Another crossover artist was
   Olivia Newton-John
   , who emerged from
   Australia
   in the mid-1970s, hoping to make it big in the United States. Her single "
   Let Me Be There
   " became a big pop-country crossover hit in 1974. She won a
   Grammy
   award for "
   Best Female Country Vocal Performance
   " for the song, and also won the
   Country Music Association
   's most coveted award for females, "Female Vocalist of the Year" (beating out established Nashville artists
   Dolly Parton
   ,
   Loretta Lynn
   , and
   Tanya Tucker
   , as well as Canadian transplant
   Anne Murray
   ). Newton-John began moving away from country in the late 1970s after starring in
   <i key="be3686a2-ae78-4bf8-9a46-1863171dd857">

   and focused mostly on pop music from then onward.

  <p key="9ef16c38-e7e8-4beb-bfc7-9de80e72f408">
   The debate raged into 1975 and reached its apex at that year's
   Country Music Association Awards
   when reigning Entertainer of the Year
   Charlie Rich
   (who himself had a series of crossover hits) presented the award to his successor, John Denver. As he read Denver's name, Rich set fire to the envelope with a cigarette lighter. The ACE would only last two years; its two biggest backers, firm traditionalists
   George Jones
   and
   Tammy Wynette
   , faced a bitter divorce, and
   Jean Shepard
   , the other major backer of the ACE, closed down the organization when she could not find others that shared her enthusiasm for the association's purpose. Bellamy Brothers "Let Your Love Flow," Starland Vocal Band "Afternoon Delight"      (1976), Amazing Rhythm Aces "Third Rate Romance" (1976) were examples of late 70s pop country hits.

   In 1977,
   Kenny Rogers
   , former frontman of the rock band
   The First Edition
   , burst onto the country charts with "
   Lucille
   " and would go on to become the most successful of the country pop performers, topping charts.  After "Lucille," Rogers had a string of songs that did well on both the country and pop charts around the world, including "
   Daytime Friends
   ," "
   The Gambler
   ," and "
   Coward of the County
   ," all of which were produced by
   Larry Butler
   . Rogers would go on to push the boundaries of pop influence in country music, having records produced by the likes of
   The Bee Gees
   ,
   Lionel Richie
   ,
   David Foster
   , and
   George Martin
   , all of which did well in both the pop and country markets.
   Barbara Mandrell
   's vocal style is also known for blue-eyed soul style. Several of her other hits charted on the country adult contemporary charts, but her songs were the Bubbling under Billboard top 100 charts. She was one of country music's most successful artists during the 1970s and 1980s. She was involved in a serious car accident in 1984.
   Her big country hits included "Sleeping Single In a Double Bed," and "(If Loving You is Wrong) I Don't Wanna be Right.

   country radio
   full power to determine a chart ranking by their collective

   . The commercial boom in the industry during this time was also attributable to the rise of talented artists who coincided with the implementation of new marketing strategies that were meant to attract a larger fan base; this further pushed the genre into a pop musical style with an emerging new image.
   Garth Brooks

   The 2010s saw many changes  for the country-pop genre, not only in sound, but also in values; there was a significant shift away from big-voiced
   power ballads
   to more irreverent, casual, hip-hop influenced styles. One such trend was the controversial
   bro-country
   subgenre, which
   <i key="96f00bed-b3fa-4de7-aee9-1f761279077b">

   restored recording sales to the chart formula but also added airplay from non-country stations, giving an inherent advantage to country pop crossover songs, at the same time maintaining the 1990 formula solely to measure country radio airplay. After the change, crossover songs have increasingly set the record for the longest run atop the country chart for longer and longer stretches; "Meant to Be" currently holds the record, 50 weeks and counting as of November 2018, more than double the pre-2012 record (

   The way audiences consumed their music also changed during the 2010s decade, as
   streaming services
   became more prominent, thus affecting how artists marketed their songs.
   Being played on the radio was no longer a requirement to be a contender in the country industry, as it had been for decades before; one such example was
   Kacey Musgraves
   . Despite receiving little airplay for her singles sent to country radio, Musgraves won the
   Grammy award
   for
   Album of the Year

   Musgraves’ success was unprecedented in the sense that she earned fans from both the pop and country genres without the benefit of airplay on country radio, instead promoting her music through online media platforms such as
   YouTube
   and
   Apple Music

    The Hoya

   pointed out Musgraves' groundbreaking approach, writing, "Musgraves’ refusal to bend the knee for Nashville record label executives, coupled with her massive success, proves she is the Nashville big machine’s worst nightmare. She is a female artist who managed to find widespread success in an industry that endlessly tried to muzzle her."

  <p key="f7094615-a02d-4889-80c0-9cd3f69ae70c">
   The disparity between male and female artists on country radio became even more obvious during the back half of this decade, with one study finding that male artists accounted for 5.5 to 1 in total airplay during the years 2000–2018.
   In 2018, that number only increased, with a ratio of male vs. female at 9.7 to 1.
   In 2015, radio consultant Keith Hill made controversial comments about why women received less representation on the radio, referring to male artists as the "salad" and women as "tomatoes"; the controversy became known as
   Tomato-gate

   wrote, "Sam Hunt and Maren Morris arrived on the scene in the years that followed, each of them possessing fluency in the postures and cadences of millennial pop that turned heads and blurred boundaries. "Modern country singers love to flaunt phrases and attitudes borrowed from hip-hop, but Hunt's borrowings are softer and sneakier," noted Kelefa Sanneh.
   Jon Caramanica said: "Think of all the ways dissenters have tried to upend country in recent years: by sneaking in rhythmic vocal tics learned from rappers, by thinning out the genre's musical baggage, by pledging inclusive values. Ms. Morris, an astute synthesizer, has studied and perfected them all."

   Still, the debate on what constituted the country sound continued into the 2020s decade. Despite placing at the top of Billboard's Top Country Albums chart, Kacey Musgraves' album
