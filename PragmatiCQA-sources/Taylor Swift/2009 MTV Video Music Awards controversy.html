   In what was an off the record part of an interview, the incident received condemnation from even U.S. President Barack Obama, who invited West to perform at the Youth Inaugural Ball in January.

   later obtained audio of the comment.
   "You know, it was like, she's getting an award and what are you butting in? ...The young lady seems like a perfectly nice person, she's getting her award and what's he doing up there? He's a jackass," said Obama.
   The "off the air" comment forced ABC, whose news anchor Terry Moran leaked the information, to issue an apology after the Internet quickly "became abuzz over the stunning remark".
   Additionally, West was criticized by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter for the outburst.
   The day following his outburst, West posted a second apology on his blog;
   and appeared on

   later that night, where he delivered another apology to Swift which was met with cheers from the crowd.
   "Dealing with the fact that I hurt someone or took anything away, you know, from a talented artist—or from anyone—because I only wanted to help people," he said, "...My entire life, I've only wanted to do and give something that I felt was right and I immediately knew in this situation that it was wrong."

   Emil Wilbekin, managing editor of
   , said West may have gone too far with his antics this time. "I think that it was not Kanye's place to speak for Beyoncé or to ruin Taylor Swift's moment," said Wilbekin. "It's OK for Kanye to rattle off about himself, but I think he crossed the line when he decided to speak for other people."
   Ann Powers of the

   said that "from one vantage point, it was a case of chivalry gone horribly wrong" as West meant to "stand up for" Beyoncé.
   She added that when Swift accepted Beyoncé's invitation to return to the stage, "The two women [engaged in] a quick sisterly embrace, adding another layer of meaning to an already complicated moment. Now this controversy was about women sticking up for each other, too."

    Well, I think my overall thought process was something like, 'Wow, I can't believe I won, this is awesome, don't trip and fall, I'm gonna get to thank the fans, this is so cool. Oh, Kanye West is here. Cool haircut. What are you doing there?' And then, 'Ouch.' And then, 'I guess I'm not gonna get to thank the fans.'

  </blockquote>
  <p key="905319c4-f9b3-417b-ae63-ead91fb7833c">
   Swift described how she had to get over the shock quickly. "You know, I'm not gonna say that I wasn't rattled by it," she said. "But I had to perform live five minutes later, so I had to get myself back to the place where I could perform."
   She said that West had not spoken to her following the incident.

   West's outburst resulted in an internet meme which saw images of West being superimposed onto other images alongside text in the style of his VMA outburst ("X is one of the greatest Y of all time", or variants thereon, in some cases accompanied by "I'm a let you finish" and/or "I'm really happy for you"). This culminated in the launch of the blog/imageboard site
   , which compiles such images.
