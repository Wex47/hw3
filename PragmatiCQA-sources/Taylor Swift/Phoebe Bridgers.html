   Although she is a frequent collaborator with many people, she has released a few albums under her name. She released an EP on March 31st, 2014 under Ryan Adams, known for his band
   <i key="a69190d6-0cbf-4c98-a324-a5f93820a35d">
    Whiskeytown
   </i>
   and his
   1989
   cover. Very little is known about the EP, being released to relative obscurity and not much fanfare, besides the songs on the EP itself. It featured the song Chelsea, - a reference to the Chelsea Hotel - Georgia, the title track Killer, Turned Around, and Whatever.
  </p>
  <p key="4f83b576-3cfc-4420-ab54-6fdfdbcfec89">
   Following that she released a string of EPs including the 2015 duplicate named Killer, Daytrotter Session, a compilation of her songs on tour with other bands called 2016 Tour CD, and the 2017 singles for her upcoming album Stranger in the Alps entitled Smoke Signals and the demo for Motion Sickness.

    Stranger in the Alps
   </i>
   . She released it on September 22nd, 2017 via Dead Oceans.
   It was supported by vinyl, which only had limited copies produced including the demo Lavender version which has been highly sought after. It included a reprise of her previous EPs Killer with Killer, Georgia, Chelsea, Would You Rather, but also new tracks like Motion Sickness, Funeral, Demi Moore, Scott Street, You Missed My Heart, and the two versions of the single Smoke Signals.
   It received generally mediocre reviews from

   From there she would re-release two songs from Stranger in the Alps, recording them for Spotify at their studio in New York City in 2018. She also released an EP as a precursor to her next album entitled "Inner Demos" which showed demos of some of the songs off the album. This would lead to her most acclaimed release,

If We Make It Through December, the other also showcased 4 songs with the title track being the most famous.

   Although she has been extremely private with her relationships, some have come out while others have been rumors. The first confirmed relationship she had was with Ryan Adams, in 2014 when he was 40 and she was 20, turning romantic after promising to "jump-start her career". Bridgers later accused, along with seven other women, of being abusive. She then started a relationship with Emily Bannon, who was also with reportedly consensual Chris Nelson. Nelson later sued Bridgers after Bannon and Bridgers continued their relationship after Nelson and Bannon broke up and claimed Phoebe, "maliciously and intentionally posted the false and defamatory statements about [Nelson] as part of a vendetta to destroy [Nelson's] reputation."
