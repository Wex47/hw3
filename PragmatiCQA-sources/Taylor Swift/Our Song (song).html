   Swift self-penned "Our Song" for the talent show of her freshman year in high school with no intentions of including it on her debut album.
   She thought to herself that to be appropriate for the talent show, the song she would write needed to be upbeat and relateable to her classmates.
   "I wrote it about this guy I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one", she said.
   The writing process, as with her lead single "
   Tim McGraw
   ", took place in approximately twenty minutes.
   Several months after performing it at the talent show, some of her peers approached her to inform her that they enjoyed the song she played at the talent show, singing a few lines.
   "They'd only heard it once, so I thought, 'There must be something here!'", Swift recalled.
   When choosing tracks to record for
   <i key="b32c4a4a-fe5f-4d13-80c3-1dda438b4cb1">

   </i>
   , Swift "stood by" "Our Song", repeatedly insisting album producers to record it with her. She claimed she "knew there was something about it."
   She concluded, "I think there's just some sort of magic in the way the track sounds like it's bouncing."
   Swift said she desired for the song to be placed as the closing track on
   <i key="f28d9c8d-0ac7-4878-8b5b-276024a120e9">
    Taylor Swift
   </i>
   due to its last lyrics repeating the phrase "Play it again", which she thought would subliminally request audiences to replay the album.
   Big Machine Records executives chose "Our Song" to be the third single from
   <i key="f49d2c56-5d43-47b9-af3d-cfd5b5a08340">

   </i>
   , which Swift was surprised
   yet glad about.
   The song was released as a CD single on August 22, 2007.
   "Our Song" was introduced to countries outside of Canada and the United States in the international version of Swift's second studio album,

   "Our Song" is a country music song with a length of three minutes and twenty-two seconds.
   It is set in compound time with eight eighth notes per bar and has a moderately fast tempo of 96 beats per minute.
   However, Sean Dooley of About.com described "Our Song" as a snappy midtempo number.
   The song is written in the key of D major and Swift's vocals span one octave, from G

   Jody Rosen of Slant Magazine considers Swift's vocal performance to be twangful.
   It follows the chord progression D–Em7–G–A.
   The song's instrumentation relies mainly on banjo
   and, after the completion of the break, a violin solo arrives.

   The lyrics are in first person.
   In the first verse, the protagonist realizes she and her boyfriend do not have a song of their own as he drives his car.
   The young couple come to using the events in their lives in place of a regular song in the song's refrains.
   Those events are described in sharp detail and include slamming screen doors to sneak out late.
   Dooley identified Swift's role in "Our Song" to be a narrator.

He identified Swift's "uncanny ability, especially at such a young age, to write a compelling narrative" as the song's highlight, referencing the opening lines "I was riding shutgon with my hair undone in the front seat of his car / He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel / The other on my heart."

   The accompanying music video for "Our Song" was directed by Trey Fanjoy.
   While listening to "Our Song", Fanjoy shared her ideas for a music video with Swift. "She had this idea for a front porch performance and then a field of flowers for another performance, then a black-and-white performance shot. It all came together in her head. She was able to translate that so well onto film. It just shows what a truly great director she is", Swift informed CMT News.
   The video begins with a shot of Swift's toenails as she paints them. Swift, casually wearing a blue tank top, white hot pants, and straightened hair is revealed to be engaging in a phone conversation in a bedroom. A cut-scene shows Swift affront a restroom mirror, which she writes the word "Love", before furtively approaching a front porch, seen in a blue dress and curly hair. Swift then sits near the edge and performs "Our Song". The scene transitions to Swift lying on a bed of flowers and wearing an orange evening gown. She holds a card that spells her first name. Then, clothed in a long, black dress, black cowboy boots, and black gloves, Swift sings with a microphone and a backup band behind her in front of a white backdrop. Throughout the remainder of the video, scenes alternate between previous settings and concludes giggling while sitting on the front porch.
The video was shot on a sound stage.
The video premiered on September 14, 2007 on CMT.
   The video received a nomination for "Number One Streamed Music Video" at the web-hosted 2008 CMT Online Awards, but lost to

    I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
    In the front seat of his car
    He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
    The other on my heart
    I look around, turn the radio down
    He says, "Baby is something wrong?"
    I say, "Nothing, I was just thinking
    How we don't have a song"
    And he says
    Our song is the slamming screen door
    Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
    When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
    'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
    Our song is the way you laugh
    The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
    And when I got home 'fore I said amen
    Asking God if he could play it again
    I was walking up the front porch steps
    After everything that day
    Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
    And lost and thrown away
    Got to the hallway, well on my way
    To my lovin' bed
    I almost didn't notice all the roses
    And the note that said
    Our song is the slamming screen door
    Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
    When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
    'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
    Our song is the way you laugh
    The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
    And when I got home 'fore I said amen
    Asking God if he could play it again
    I've heard every album, listened to the radio
    Waited for something to come along
    That was as good as our song
    'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
    Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
    When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
    'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
    Our song is the way he laughs
    The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
    And when I got home 'fore I said amen
    Asking God if he could play it again
    Play it again
    I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
    In the front seat of his car
    I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
    And I wrote down our song
