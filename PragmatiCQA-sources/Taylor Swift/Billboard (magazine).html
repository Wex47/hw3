   The very first Billboard - then called Billboard Advertising - the magazine was released by William H. Donaldson and James H. Hennegan of Cincinnati on November 1st, 1894.
   In 1897, it would be changed to "The Billboard" to appease editorial concerns by its staff, and then Donaldson purchased Hennegan's share in 1900 so the company wouldn't go bankrupt. This would lead to many important changes, like publishing the magazine weekly instead of monthly to engage audiences and get more timely reporting.
  </p>
  <p key="77fadec9-dc4a-4d57-a14a-de92a807d3d6">
   In 1932 they decided to add a section called "Amusement Machines", which also added charts for jukeboxes, which were experiencing a surge around this time. This made them publish weekly charts for the best-sellers, the precursor to the Hot 100. In World War II, which had happened shortly after starting in 1939, more music charts would emerge onto the scene. This was due to more people wanting to enter the music business, with various genres and formats.

  <p key="6f7455eb-31dc-4e83-ac7c-4b80b80e6c18">
   In January 1961, they again switched names to

   (in 1963, it would be shortened to Billboard) to emphasize the music section of it, as their charts had exploded in popularity. By 1984, they would become the undeniable leader in music. It was old in 1897 to Affiliated  Publications, purchasing many magazines under it, although private investors would buy back 75% of it.

   In 1994, it would be sold to VNU (not known as Neilsen), wherein it was combined with other enterprises, it would go into doubt from the amount of buying it had done and had a halting takeover. Tamara Conniff would decide to lead a major rebranding, jumping sales over 10%. Seeing that they would fall if they continued on music, they would reach out into other branches including gossip and celebrity fashion.
