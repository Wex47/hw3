   Darkstalker had ebony
   black scales
   and midnight-black wings,
   appearing as a pure NightWing except for a line of icy, white,
   silvery IceWing scales where his wings met his body.
   He had one silver teardrop scale on the outward corner of his dark
   eyes,
   which were as black as underground caverns.
   He had a narrow, handsome face, long, twisted horns,
   and was enormous,
   at least three times as tall as the largest living dragons.
   His huge
   wingspan was as wide as Agate Mountain,
   and he had a long neck.
   He wore a plain, white, half-hoop earring made of bone in his left ear.
   He was handsome
   and powerfully built,
   with scales that felt as hard as armor.
   He moved slowly and purposefully
   and spoke in a cavernous, booming,
   low rumble.

   thoughtful,
   cocky, proud,
   defiant,
   happy,
   hopeful,
   mischievous,
   patient,
   intelligent, intense, knowledgeable,
   and sarcastic.
   He was charming, courageous, and cared about those he loved very deeply.
   He believed in not worrying excessively about the future, and preferred to focus on the present.
   In his youth, he was willing to make an enormous sacrifice by creating his talisman in order to make Clearsight feel safe.
   He hated sleeping, as he felt that he had so much to do, and missing out on things made him feel restless.
   He was skilled at problem-solving,
   and had a nervous energy about him whenever he had to tell someone something.
   He knew how to play tricks with his words,

  <p key="6f2712bd-a1a1-4e1b-b903-2bafbbf1c327">
   Several of his earlier spells were kind: a doll carved to look like a scavenger that would appear at Whiteout's pillow every night; a plate that kept prey warm for Hope when she was late for dinner; a blanket that ensured peaceful sleep for Hope when she was in the
   Kingdom of Sand
   with the NightWing army; a set of paints for
   Whiteout
   that never dried or ran out; a bell that rang whenever Fathom felt sad or lonely.
  </p>
  <p key="390236dd-9a0f-4e88-83c5-7b249bc1acad">
   However, his later, larger spells were much more menacing: a dagger to kill one IceWing every full moon for one year; spells to torment classmates he hated in small, creative ways; a spell that sent nightmares to
   Diamond
   with all of the ways he planned to kill her.
   He was crueler than necessary towards

   and held a serious grudge against
   Indigo
   after she attempted to kill him.
   He began hiding certain enchantments from Clearsight
   and despite Clearsight stating she would never be okay with her feelings being manipulated,
   and Fathom pleading with him not to use his animus magic,
   he used his powers without regard to either of them. He was dismissive,
   defiant, and even smiled at Clearsight when confronted about manipulating her foresight ability.
   He was genuinely puzzled as to why Clearsight did not want him to murder
   Vigilance
   and truly believed that Clearsight's moonstone earrings were simply a kindhearted, sweet gesture to help her focus less on desolate futures.
   He was completely willing to force Clearsight and Fathom along the path he desired, even if he had to drag them along it kicking and screaming.
   He was also willing to keep Clearsight in a relationship with him against her will, even if she had wanted to separate.
  </p>
  <p key="cce33557-8dff-48f6-bb42-2619d2b5aded">
   After he began to seek vengeance upon the IceWing tribe, he became dishonest,
   devious,
   vengeful,
   furious,
   manipulative,
   angry, and callous.
   He radiated menace.
   He adopted an unsettling
   new smile that implied Darkstalker thought he would always be okay, and nothing bad could happen to him, and that he could arrange the world the way he wanted. The loss of his mother broke him into a thousand pieces on the inside, making him furious and devastated, but he could hide it very well.
   He devolved into a sad, furious mourning,
   but a strange angry kind where he kept insisting his mother would come home soon.
  </p>
  <p key="f5d16535-2540-4b84-b1bd-7e5f630c4a25">
   Darkstalker then, suddenly, appeared happier and more energetic, explaining that he had found a way to deal with all of his most annoying problems.
   These included enchanting Indigo to become trapped inside of a small wooden dragon, and to leave a note for Fathom to manipulate him into believing she had returned to the

   </a>
   and did not love him anymore;
   enchanting a pair of moonstone earrings for Clearsight to, unwillingly, be forced to focus on the brightest futures;
   and enchanting Arctic to obey his every command.
   He acted falsely sympathetic towards Fathom
   and was grimly determined upon finding and punishing the dragon who had sent
   Quickdeath
   to assassinate him.
   He eventually was eerily blank when facing the concept of Hope's death,
   and wanted the NightWings to fear and respect him.
   Clearsight saw multiple highly likely futures in which Darkstalker killed her after she stole his talisman,
   and feared that Darkstalker would soon enchant away her and Fathom's ability to feel and think for themselves freely.
  </p>
  <p key="e9b5926b-fd00-4a07-9d8e-e624bee698e7">
   After awakening from his sleeping spell, Darkstalker acted like a charming, sincere,
   ambitious
   leader, causing other dragons to follow him.
   Immediately after being released, he cast a secret enchantment to make other dragons believe that he was charming, friendly,
   humbled, and unambitious.
   However, after being released from said enchantment, Darkstalker was seen as brainwashing, genocidal,
   complicated,
   sinister,
   evil, and deserving of what had come to him.
   When Moonwatcher explained how fundamentally wrong killing the entire IceWing tribe was, he only growled that they had started it.
   He appeared externally to be polite,
   friendly, at peace, and slightly bored.
   His gaze was intense, and made Qibli feel as though Darkstalker could look through him, to see all the versions of Qibli that had ever existed and all of the ones that might ever be.
   He was desperately lonely,
   but did not trust other animus dragons; each one was a threat to his absolute power.
   He was careful to feed his subjects' vanity and need for usefulness so that they would love him all the more.
   He wanted to make the world a better place, and he wanted genuine friends,
   but it was difficult for him to admit when he was in the wrong,
   and he was astounded and upset by the soul reader's opinion of his lack of morality.
   His choices were vengeful,
   dark, and damaging,
   even if he genuinely believed they would lead to the best future.

Preyhunter added that The Darkstalker played with his prey until they were paralyzed with fear before attacking. Fierceteeth disregards this, and the trio continues flying.

       Later, while Moonwatcher read a scroll on animus history in search of information on dreamvisitors, she came across the legend of Fathom and Darkstalker. Darkstalker then admitted that he was the same mind-reading, prophetic animus dragon from the legend. He claimed that history had gotten it wrong, and he was not a monster. After two thousand years, the bracelet that Fathom enchanted to make Darkstalker sleep for all eternity had snapped due to the tremors caused by the

Winter and Qibli later caught up, arguing over the animus touched scroll.

They flew off to save him from attempted murder and found him with his throat slashed, lying in a pool of blood, though miraculously, still alive. Darkstalker healed Stonemover with a stalactite, simultaneously removing the stone enchantment on his scales. Stonemover then woke, reacting with fear at the name 'Darkstalker' before beginning to yell that his claws were not his. Darkstalker said he could enchant him to calm down, with Sunny and Stonemover quickly saying that he should not do that. This ends in Darkstalker begrudgingly reverting him to stone. Anemone enters with Flame following, and he admitted that he tried to kill Stonemover because he lied about being able to heal Flame's scars.

Qibli denied that, but Darkstalker tested him for animus magic by telling Qibli to enchant his scroll to roll up. After confirming that Qibli did not and could not cast any animus spells, Darkstalker commented on his intelligence, remarking that he would have been a great animus. When he leaves, Turtle and Qibli realized that he must have cast a spell to sense when animus magic were being cast.

       for the throne of the NightWings, but she declined with a different idea: the NightWings that choose to go with Darkstalker could leave, and the NightWings that want to stay could stay. Darkstalker decided to stay in the Rainforest Kingdom for a day. Few NightWings seemed interested in spending time with Darkstalker, knowing his history, but after his offering of superpower enchantments and casting his charm spell on them — they begun to warm up to him. When Turtle got Anemone to wake Kinkajou in the

       Darkstalker also saved Glory's life. When he looked into the future, he saw Fierceteeth leading a band of escapees from

       The next morning, Darkstalker left for the
        lost city of night
        with most of the tribe, leaving only forty to fifty NightWings in the Rainforest. Darkstalker also freed Fierceteeth and Strongwings from the RainWing prison, bringing them with him. Darkstalker begged Moon to join him, but Moon said that she wanted to stay with Glory but would visit the lost city with Turtle and Kinkajou, as the lost city needed to be found to stop Jade Mountain from being destroyed according to

       . Anemone saw Darkstalker begging and said to Moon that she was nothing special and did not deserve his attention. The tribe flew the whole day and rested next to the ocean. In the middle of the night, Darkstalker suddenly left his tribe to fly somewhere, and Turtle was forced to follow him. He went past a mountain range, later to be realized as

       by Winter. When he arrived at his destination, Turtle realized it to be the lost city of night. Darkstalker went over to his rugged, abandoned school and found a painting of Clearsight. He begun to cry, and Turtle felt pity for who had seemingly be portrayed as a monster and wondered if he could even afford that. In an attempt to get Darkstalker talking, Turtle picked up a marble and placed it next to his feet. He picked it up, asking if Clearsight to speak to him if she was still there. He then asked her to listen, apologizing for everything he did and promising that they could still rule the NightWings together if she came back. Eventually, he admitted to himself that Clearsight was not here and that she could not be, thus flying back to his tribe.
      </p>
      <p key="5f422821-5b7d-4df1-885f-7def94030056">
       The next day, Darkstalker lead all the NightWings into the old kingdom. While the tribe adjusted to the new territory, he showed Anemone to Fathom's old suite. After 2,000 years, it stood in disrepair, but when Anemone complained about this, she was told to clean it up with her magic. Anemone decided to take out her anger and jealousy on Moon by enchanting a broom to whack her until she cleans up the room herself. She also enchanted jewels to distract Darkstalker and make him forget about Moon. Darkstalker was not fooled by the enchantments, returning to Anemone's room to banish her from the lost city. He cited her as a true descendant of Fathom and "just like him." Darkstalker told her to kill her mother if she wanted, or anyone else who stands in her way.
      </p>
      Darkstalker sensed the spells being cast during Anemone and Turtle's battle and summoned all the living animus dragons in Pyrrhia to his throne room. He then asked Stonemover how many dragons were in the room. The old NightWing said four, and Darkstalker finally realized that somebody had been sneaking behind his back, hidden. Anemone told Darkstalker that the dragon was brave and did not trust him from the beginning, and the king cast a spell on her to obey his every command and shut up. He cast another spell to bring in the dragon's loved one, Kinkajou, and said that she would die if he did not appear. Turtle threw his magic stick to Anemone, who caught it and was free from Darkstalker's knowledge; he did not remember her or that he cast a spell on her. Darkstalker then stripped Turtle of his animus power and placed him in his dungeon.

      Darkstalker was soaring away with Moon, Turtle, Anemone, and the NightWing students to see the NightWing tribe and become their king. Qibli observed that the NightWings were letting Darkstalker lead the way even though he most likely did not know where the NightWings live in the rainforest. When Qibli gives Sunny and Tsunami copies of his enchanted earring using a bowl Turtle left him, it proved that Darkstalker had set a spell to make every dragon in Pyrrhia to like him and not think he is evil.

       , Winter was frightened of all the IceWings getting sick and started to take off to ask Darkstalker for help, proving that Darkstalker did enchant Winter specifically to like him, more so than the enchantment placed on other dragons. Winter remained unaffected by the plague because of Darkstalker's promise to Moonwatcher that he would not hurt her friends.

      <p key="cfcf1d27-24d1-4393-8ced-324afc014394">
       Later, Qibli looked into the Obsidian Mirror again and looked at Moon first. Kinkajou and Moon were fighting about if Darkstalker was evil or not. Kinkajou said he is evil but could not tell Moon why because then Darkstalker would know, and Moon believed he was a good dragon. They also spied on Darkstalker himself and found him giving powers to the NightWings on a limited account.
      </p>
      <p key="8f8d88e9-369e-42fd-b95a-bdd4d56f0fb1">
       When Qibli got to the lost city of night and talks to Moon, he gave her the earring, and she said nothing had happened, stating Darkstalker had not put a spell on Moon because he liked her as a friend. Darkstalker walked into the library where Moon and Qibli were, noticing the earring Moon is wearing. Darkstalker walked in later with Fierceteeth, enchanted to look and act like Clearsight.
      </p>
      <p key="e484f7e5-402a-4921-af5c-00307fe161dd">
       Later, Moon and Qibli spied on Darkstalker and overhear him casting spells on the fake Clearsight to recreate her, which ultimately failed. Later during the spell casting, there was a glimpse of Darkstalker's good side, suggesting he was not completely evil. When Moon showed herself, Darkstalker noticed the skyfire she is wearing and asked if they were really friends. Moon responded, saying it was hard to be friends with him when he lied to her and did such terrible things. She also suggested that the fake Clearsight idea was terrible and should be turned back to whoever it was. Darkstalker asked if she would be his friend forever if he changes fake Clearsight back into whoever it was. Moon refused to promote it because of the IceWing plague, and Darkstalker revealed that an IceWing-NightWing battle would take place at Jade Mountain because of his return. When the vision returned, he turned fake Clearsight back into Fierceteeth and prepared the NightWings for war, granting many of them superpowers along the way.

      <p key="f058592b-986b-4150-a444-79743cf1be54">
       During the battle, Anemone used a spell suggested by Qibli on the NightWings, asking them to retreat in Darkstalker's voice telepathic, which failed as he shows up and said it was a fake, also throwing a boulder at Anemone and Turtle, which did not kill them due to Turtle's spell to make his scales invulnerable.
      </p>
      <p key="e9a91c88-0977-4327-8cf8-2577ca0863fd">
       When Anemone used the next spell, suggested by Qibli, that linked the minds of all the IceWings and NightWings for a hundred dragon heartbeats, Darkstalker grabbed Qibli with a swift movement and carried him to the spot where he burst from his underground prison after being trapped there for 2,000 years. He stated the similarities between Qibli and himself and offered a deal to make Qibli an animus if he could put a spell on him to make him not try to harm him. He also stated that he needed Qibli's mind to help him make the right choices and just wanted friends. He even summoned Vulture and enchanted him to obey his every command, which he used to quiet him, and showed how he could change Vulture into the grandfather Qibli wanted. When Qibli refused the deal, Darkstalker threatened that he would have to kill him otherwise, but when Qibli suggests that it is evil to kill him, Darkstalker suggested ripping his earring off and putting a powerful spell on him. Before he could do so, Qibli pulled out the soulreader and pointed it at Darkstalker, revealing that he was more evil than good. Darkstalker got terrified by this revelation and thought that it was broken, so he re-enchants it and pointed it at Vulture, showing Vulture was just as evil as portrayed with Darkstalker. He did it on himself again and gets even more terrified of how he was evil even if he protected his soul. Qibli suggested it was because of his actions and not his magic. Darkstalker suddenly got a strange vision and reveals that he knows Moon was watching them. Moon and Kinkajou showed up, and they asked him to come with them. He decided to and finally meets up with Foeslayer, his mother.
      </p>
      Darkstalker, happy to see his mother, told her about what the soul reader stated. Foeslayer agreed that his choices were evil, and Moon told Darkstalker her vision of a dragon obsessed with strawberries, getting married, having two dragonets, and living happily for the rest of his life. Moon suggested this dragon is him but with a spell to restart his life. Darkstalker refused to do so because he wanted to remember Clearsight and keep his powers. He said that with his power, he could create a good future. Foeslayer, Moon, Kinkajou, and Qibli all agreed it was better if he did not do that. Foeslayer handed him a strawberry and suggested that he did it because it would make both of them happy. After considering a little, he ate the strawberry, saying that no animus magic will work on him, but Kinkajou furiously told him that his own magic would. As he slowly turned into a RainWing-NightWing dragonet, he begged to keep his powers and memories. Qibli said he had his chances and chose the wrong choices, as a one-year-old part-RainWing-part-NightWing dragonet named Peacemaker is created from Darkstalker.

His parents, Arctic and Foeslayer, were arguing about Darkstalker's name; Foeslayer, his mother, saw it as a hero that chased back the darkness, while his father, Prince Arctic, saw it as a villain that crept through the shadows. Darkstalker foresaw that he could make his sister's egg hatch on the Brightest Night as well, but he decided against it out of selfishness and the desire for all of his mother's love.

      <p key="9cdcf2e1-8f6b-4020-8533-27132c6adc9c">
       The next day, after school, Darkstalker took Clearsight to his house, which was empty; both of his parents were at work. He showed her a blank scroll, also known as his talisman, that was wrapped in a black leather casing, and explained that he had put all of his animus power into it so that he would not lose any of his soul when he used his magic. Any time a dragon wanted to use the scroll, they only had to write down their specific enchantment, and it would happen, just like natural animus power. Darkstalker enchanted four things with it that day: an inkpot, a blanket, a moonstone bracelet, and one of his history scrolls. However, they were caught in the act by Arctic, who angrily scolded his son, warning him not to waste his animus power. He enchanted more items that included an earring that made him look especially charming and handsome, a goblet that he planned to give to Fathom — which was enchanted to make him forget Indigo, forget about his oath, and use his animus power freely — Clearsight's moonstone earrings to make her see only happy futures, a pebble that made Indigo turn into the SeaWing carving that Fathom made, sneaky enchantments on other students at his school, and many more.
      </p>
      <p key="9a76bd4d-3159-4f3a-8214-7268a2bf13d8">
       Arctic later told Queen Vigilance that Darkstalker has animus powers, and arrangements are made for Prince Fathom, an animus, to come and befriend Darkstalker. This was done in the hope that Darkstalker would be more cautious with his powers since no one besides Clearsight knew about his scroll at this point.
      </p>
      <p key="20ee2e28-9704-4beb-8118-b09ea00c86f4">
       Darkstalker formally meets Fathom at the SeaWing welcoming party the NightWings had thrown. Darkstalker thinks that Fathom looks uncomfortable at the party and possibly terrified since the Royal SeaWing Massacre had happened at a party as well. So, Darkstalker tries to make him more comfortable by inviting him and his guard, Indigo, to go on a flight with him. However, Indigo is suspicious of Darkstalker and shows this when she attempts to kill him once they are outside. Although Fathom convinced Indigo not to kill him, Darkstalker wants to get revenge on Indigo from then on and makes plans to get rid of Indigo for personal reasons and that he thinks that Fathom would be better off without her.
      </p>
      <p key="15be6201-09a3-4f12-aa4f-b531cd6c4a90">
       After the party, Darkstalker thought about how Indigo could have killed him right then and there. He did not want anyone ever to murder him or even accidentally kill him, so he decided to enchant his scales to be invincible, hiding the enchantment from Clearsight by writing it in invisible ink.
      </p>
      <p key="f22350ae-7a32-40a2-9325-22a1f1f69a04">
       Soon, Darkstalker went with Clearsight for her to meet Fathom. Darkstalker showed Fathom a new item he enchanted, a soul reader that proves how much soul a dragon has left. Clearsight, Fathom, and Darkstalker started to become better friends. After some time, Darkstalker suggested that they all celebrate Clearsight's fifth hatching day in the woods by the
        Night Kingdom
        . There, Darkstalker presented the
        dreamvisitors
        to his friends, much to Fathom's dismay. However, his protests about Darkstalker using his magic were cut off as Clearsight has a vision about Darkstalker's mother, Foeslayer, being enchanted by Queen Diamond and sent to the Ice Kingdom.
      </p>
      <p key="48a045ce-2a16-485d-94e6-6dd4f5bc30b2">
       Darkstalker received the same vision and, anxious at this, decided to interrupt the party to go and try to save Foeslayer. When he got home, Darkstalker read in his father's, Prince Arctic's, mind that Arctic and Foeslayer fought. After this fight, she took off an earring that Arctic had enchanted to protect her, which allowed Queen Diamond's magic to get through to her. Darkstalker tried every enchantment he could think of, but nothing works. Later, when Queen Vigilance is with Clearsight, Vigilance sent an assassin after Darkstalker.
      </p>
      <p key="806b1b56-72d1-418e-a42c-8a53f03aa1f0">
       When Darkstalker arrived, he shared some of his ideas for what they could do to the IceWings with his magic. Most of them were brutal, and Clearsight was horrified by all of his ideas that lead to the IceWings' genocide. Eventually, Darkstalker settles on the idea of a shield that killed only IceWings.
      </p>
      <p key="8e62f2ce-b63f-4aa1-94b9-fa55e415f86c">
       Darkstalker continued to mourn the loss of his mother for a few weeks. Eventually, Darkstalker asked Fathom if he wanted to fly up to the Royal Tower and watch the lightning storm with him. Fathom gave Darkstalker a statue of a SeaWing that he had requested, which he took and offered Fathom a goblet made of shimmering sea-green glass. Indigo smashed it before Fathom could take it, fearing that it is enchanted. Still fearing Indigo's safety with Darkstalker around, Fathom decided that
        Wharf
        should come with him instead of Indigo.
      </p>
      <p key="13f79c2b-9c86-4268-b6f7-c76f7f3ae568">
       Later on, Clearsight and Listener went to a festival being held in the
        Great Diamond
        . Clearsight and Listener met up with Darkstalker, Fathom, and Whiteout, who were all playing a board game. They invited

       , who was playing alone, to join them. Before
        Listener
        could introduce herself to Thoughtful, Clearsight introduced Whiteout first, who took Thoughtful's talon and looked at his palm before saying, "Words and glass, spun in flutes and verse. Waterfalls of language in fire-blown claws," and then told him that he was the one who made the Cascade of Dreams. Thoughtful was surprised and amazed that she had noticed his art and said, "No one — you really saw the pieces of the scroll inside the waves?" Whiteout then confirmed this, and due to the strange grammar Whiteout was using and Thoughtful's ability to understand it, the whole conversation left Listener bewildered. However, before anyone could explain what happened to her, a spear was thrust into Darkstalker's heart.
      </p>
      <p key="dc85817f-d2b4-45ff-9f8b-cb745c7e6244">
       Thanks to his invincible scales, he survived the attack, although he told his friends that the assassin must have missed.
        Lionfish
        tackled the assassin, killing him quickly. The assassin turned out to be Quickdeath, an assassin for hire. Darkstalker wanted to find out who tried to assassinate him, and Fathom became suspicious of Darkstalker. Later on, Darkstalker went home and used his scroll to find out who tried to assassinate him. He found out and deemed that whoever did it "has to pay."
      </p>
      <p key="f4c7a769-564a-4a1c-8fd3-1778cd37e514">
       Clearsight then encountered Queen Vigilance and Allknowing in the garden. Allknowing shared her vision,
       <i key="cd65111a-3ba2-452c-ba7a-f5cea1f18a7d">
        Hatched of ice and hatched of night. Cursed with moons all shining bright. Longs for power not his own. Comes to steal your very throne
       </i>
       . Clearsight took off her earrings after the Queen accused her of being enchanted by Darkstalker. Visions, all of which were dark and bad, came rushing back to her, and she realized that Vigilance sent the assassin. The guards attempt to imprison Clearsight, but she escaped to stop Darkstalker before he reached the queen. When she found him, Darkstalker revealed that he enchanted her earrings to keep her focused on the bright, positive futures and block out any dark ones.
      </p>
      <p key="b228f0df-cc5f-412b-9b81-b55cede8250a">
       Clearsight then had a vision that depicted Arctic taking Whiteout north to the Ice Kingdom. To track them down, Darkstalker enchanted a beetle to bite off Arctic's shielding earring, and then enchanted a dagger to lead them to Arctic and stab him in one of his legs to render him immobile. Darkstalker started to write something down in his scroll as Arctic explained that if he offered Whiteout's talons in marriage, Diamond would release Foeslayer. Whiteout claimed that she would be an "IceWing princess and have lots of baby IceWings." Whiteout then said that she wanted to go back to the Ice Kingdom before proclaiming that she did not like Darkstalker in perfectly normal, understandable, and coherent sentences, instead of her usual way of talking.
      </p>
      <p key="69090cce-091b-46e9-a68b-97779d7d03a6">
       Darkstalker, deeply suspicious and furious at his lying father, enchanted his father to obey his every command. He ordered him to stop talking and to release Whiteout from the spell he put her under. Arctic then crushed Whiteout's shell necklace in his talons, freeing her from his magic. Darkstalker ordered Arctic to follow him back to the Night Kingdom, where he made his father cut his tongue out after announcing how he had tried to betray the NightWings and was going to offer a detailed map of the kingdom so the IceWings could infiltrate it. Then, Darkstalker told Arctic to "take his talons, rip open your stomach, and show us all what you're really like on the inside. Pour out your life on this stage." Arctic killed himself with his own claws, fulfilling Clearsight's prophecy that "your claws will betray you in your final hour."
      </p>
      <p key="c704fde9-712e-42a7-b34a-33cb89675fb0">
       While Darkstalker was distracted with Arctic, Clearsight stole his scroll. On her way to see Fathom, Clearsight warned Listener about Darkstalker and told her to escape far away with her family far away from the Night Kingdom. Then, she had Fathom enchant a bracelet for her, as they were too suspicious of the scroll to use it. When Clearsight left for Agate Mountain to meet Darkstalker one last time, Fathom took the scroll and held it over a candle. Fathom discovered spells written in invisible ink, one of which trapped Indigo in the wooden SeaWing statue Fathom had made. Fathom released Indigo from the statue with his magic.
      </p>
      <p key="213abd0f-aeea-459b-8294-bf1eeb3303bf">
       Meanwhile, Darkstalker sat next to Clearsight in front of a cave on the side of Agate Mountain. Clearsight told Darkstalker that an earthquake would make the whole side of Agate Mountain collapse and make Jade Mountain the tallest mountain instead. Clearsight mentioned that Darkstalker had gotten out of control and was turning out like Arctic. Furious, Darkstalker grabbed and twisted Clearsight's wrist painfully, and while he is doing so, she slipped the bracelet onto his arm. Before Darkstalker fell asleep, he saw how much Clearsight truly loved him and how much she worried about him.
      </p>
      <p key="1f5d86db-d762-4c6b-a150-7362152b49e5">
       A simple sleeping spell on the bracelet had taken the invincible, immortal Darkstalker down, and as long as the bracelet remained on him, he would stay asleep. Clearsight moved him into the cave before covering the entrance with rocks before going to another mountain and waiting for an earthquake she predicted to bury him further. She then flew away from the mountain, heading towards Pantala, never to be seen again by the dragons of Pyrrhia.
      </p>
      <p key="513fc931-99af-4c3b-9655-4ac1038104f1">
       The book draws to a close as Fathom and Indigo were portrayed with their dragonets, Clearpool, Cowrie, and Ripple. Their dragonets at one point asked them to tell them a story about how bad guys became bad guys. This reminded Fathom and Indigo of Darkstalker. Indigo reassured Fathom that "it's safe to be happy," and he responded with, "I know."
      </p>
      Then, in the post-epilogue, the timeline skips 2,000 years; it describes another earthquake coming after the Orb in the Sky flashed by. The rocks shifted up against the bracelet, breaking the copper wires and awakening Darkstalker.

   Darkstalker acted as a mentor to Anemone,

    He encouraged her to use her magic but tried restricting her only to use them with his permission. Due to her naturally rebellious personality and hatred of Moonwatcher, he eventually sent her off to the Kingdom of the Sea.
    Later on, once she and the other animus dragons of Pyrrhia were summoned to Darkstalker, he affirmed his view of her as a tool by suggesting he run tests on her and Stonemover to learn more about animus limits, even suggesting driving her insane.
    Darkstalker secretly hated SeaWings, specifically Anemone's family, because of their ancestry linking them to Fathom.

   Arctic resented Darkstalker.
    He often rudely asked his son if any part of him resembled an IceWing,
    and was furious upon Darkstalker's hatching that the dragonet did not resemble him.
    Arctic never looked Darkstalker in the eye, and often glared at him.
    Darkstalker believed that Arctic was the most dangerous dragon within the lost city of night,
    and when Clearsight observed Arctic and Darkstalker interacting, she noted that there were many giant, furious, unspoken thoughts and feelings that were not verbally expressed between them.
    Darkstalker was dangerous, quiet,
    angry, and crueler than necessary towards his father,
    and the only slight liking he had towards Arctic was due to his love for Hope.
    He was suspicious of
    and bothered by Darkstalker's mind-reading abilities, and was jealous of his son's knowledge of Hope's thoughts.
    They often tried to avoid one another as much as possible,

    without reserve or hesitation, mostly reciprocated. He was enthusiastic about their relationship and tried his best to make her feel happy and safe.
    He disliked that she worried over their futures so much, but loved her wholly.
    However, the tragedy of Hope's presumed death shattered him, and he became indifferent towards her free will and happiness, although later apologizing to her imagined presence.
    He tried to keep her focused on the happy futures where they had dragonets, but ultimately manipulated Clearsight's ability against her will, even seeming defiant and indifferent when confronted.
    Although Darkstalker lied to himself about this attempted manipulation of Clearsight being the best thing for her, it was really about keeping her from knowing about his schemes.
    Their relationship ultimately failed due to Darkstalker's actions, and Clearsight is not to blame.

    He genuinely wanted Fathom to be happy, but ultimately controlled several important aspects Fathom's life without his knowledge or consent. He desperately wanted to safely like Darkstalker,
    as well as badly wanting to trust him.
    After Darkstalker laughed at Fathom's joke, he was delighted,
    and Darkstalker spoke gently towards him.
    Fathom was one of his best friends,
    and he found himself so wrapped in warmth and attention around Darkstalker that he could forget, for hours at a time, about what he had been through during the massacre.
    Darkstalker was attentive to Fathom's feelings,
    and he made Fathom feel comforted.
    He would have followed Darkstalker anywhere,
    and Darkstalker was often irritated by Fathom's caution towards animus magic.
    Darkstalker eventually was completely willing to transform Fathom's mind into a quieter, less anxious state with animus magic so that he would not have to listen to his worried thoughts. He also cared for Fathom's happiness,
    and Fathom later discovered that Darkstalker had enchanted a bell that would ring whenever Fathom was feeling sad or lonely, and that was why he had always known when to show up and lift him from the worst loneliness. Darkstalker did truly care for Fathom,
    but as Fathom grew more concerned for his friend's morality,
    he was eventually forced to betray his friend.
    When Darkstalker awoke from Fathom's enchantment, his hatred of his former friend was so strong that he despised all of Fathom's descendants.
