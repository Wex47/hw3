   stormed into the room, demanding that Starflight join him at the council to see the queen. Starflight nervously came along.
  </p>
  <p key="99d8cf5a-ce9c-47b9-8ba2-028ab5cbd8ec">
   At the council, Starflight watched as they debated about attacking the RainWings. They asked Starflight what he knows, and Morrowseer threatened to kill him if he did not say anything, so he said that he thinks they were attacking. He witnessed

   Greatness
   saying, "You brought us a viper disguised as a simple garden snake," and so the guards threw him in the lava.
  </p>
  <p key="a4bd3ab6-232e-45a0-9b73-726f7f6ff3a4">
   When he tried to come up, the guards pushed him down.
   Deathbringer

  <p key="ea34ee3c-dc85-4355-bc8c-c47d8ec76844">
   Morrowseer took Starflight to an island to hunt, and when Starflight saw how the NightWings hunt, he was disgusted and tried to talk his way out of eating the giant albatross Morrowseer had killed. After listening to Starflight rant on and on about the strange hunting habits of NightWings, Morrowseer confirmed who his father is. Morrowseer took Starflight to the labs, but on the way, they met

   . Morrowseer agreed to take her to the labs if she promised to be quiet, and she happily agreed. When they met
   Mastermind

  <p key="2d9cca01-4f6c-4503-9607-5dd334dfc5be">
   At first, when Starflight met his father, Mastermind, he was filled with elation at the prospect of having such a smart father, but when he was given a tour by Mastermind around the labs, he was sickened by the fact that his father was abducting and torturing RainWings without even showing that he cared. He said that they were doing it for "science" because he did not want his son to know the real reason. When Mastermind showed him a RainWing test subject — which turned out to be

   Morrowseer then came back, saying that Starflight must be introduced to the "others." However, Starflight was not paying attention but instead pondering why the NightWings would be abducting the RainWings. The puzzle pieces clicked inside Starflight's mind, and he figured out the plan was to take the
   Rainforest
   from the RainWings and make that the new home of the NightWings. He also figured that the NightWings allied with

   Starflight was brought to meet the false dragonets, and almost immediately afterward, Morrowseer ordered the dragonets to kill him as a test. He ran away and hid in the RainWing prisons, where a guard stopped him. He told her he was there for a "school project," and she let him through, to Starflight's surprise. While waiting there, the other dragonets ran into the NightWing guard, who freaked out, not knowing that the alternate

   dragonet of destiny, shouted, "We're trying to kill a NightWing dragonet! Did you see where he went?" The guard then screamed, "THEY'RE HERE TO KILL OUR DRAGONETS!" and slammed a gong on Flame's head. After a while, Fatespeaker found him and brought him back to the cave where the dragonets had been. Morrowseer then took them to the fortress and to the dormitories where Starflight slept.
  </p>
  <p key="bbfee17c-6839-428c-a666-240f27feefd3">
   Fatespeaker woke Starflight up in the night to explore the volcano. They found the old treasury, and Starflight discovered a
   dreamvisitor
   . He attempted to contact the real dragonets with it but had to enter

   's dreams instead since no one else was sleeping. In her dream, he learned that his friends thought he had betrayed them and gone to warn the NightWings of their attack. Starflight then fell asleep feeling lonelier than he ever had before.
  </p>
  <p key="92ce9290-72a1-4a7c-a295-283cbe2995b0">
   He was woken up by Morrowseer, who brought them to the mainland to try to convince a remote outpost of SkyWings to switch their alliances to Blister. The dragonets failed, and some NightWings, who were following them, burst in and killed all the SkyWings.
   Squid
   then said he did not want to do it anymore, and Morrowseer furiously sent him away, saying he hoped Squid would die, devastating Fatespeaker. Morrowseer then took everyone back to the volcano island. Starflight and the rest of the dragonets then took a long, deserved sleep.
  </p>
  <p key="b7cee428-e227-4f83-b7f2-a3298f33273e">
   Fatespeaker woke Starflight up, saying that Flame had just snuck out, and she wanted to follow him. Flame lead the way to the NightWing dungeon, where Flame and

   had to stay when the guard caught them trying to kill Starflight. In there, they found Deathbringer, the NightWing who helped Glory escape the Night Kingdom. Flame wanted to know how to become an assassin but stormed back to bed after Deathbringer told him not to get too attached to his target — thinking of Glory — and remember that he was his own dragon, and he does not have to do everything he was told.
  </p>
  <p key="67c6fb6e-91d1-4fd1-9a9e-184285d2aad0">
   Fatespeaker and Starflight left so that they had time to find Queen

   . They found her in a secret room behind a map. When nobody was inside, Starflight thought there might have been no queen after all, but a dragon rose from a cauldron of lava in the middle of the room. They found out she was forced to stay in the cauldron because an IceWing shot their frostbreath straight down her throat. Since the lava and ice canceled each other out, if she left the lava, the ice would finish its work and kill her. Both NightWing dragonets tried to convince her that what Morrowseer was doing was too cruel, but the queen told them to do as he says and for them to leave her. The dragonets had failed to change anything.
  </p>
  <p key="e861f6a8-ee47-4da7-9fd4-76d0a6dd2d59">
   That night, Starflight took out the dreamvisitor again and successfully contacted Glory. He told her that the NightWings were attacking, and he was captured and did not betray them. He then woke up after talking with Glory and realized the blankets had changed, and the dreamvisitor was exposed.

  <p key="a79bc2f2-aaab-4a4d-8c1d-815124c144bf">

While Morrowseer took Flame back to the fortress to find healers, Starflight discovered that none of the alternate dragonets were born on the

   Frantically trying to find the dreamvisitor to warn Glory, Starflight discovered it was missing. He woke up Fatespeaker and told her that they needed to help the RainWings, but he did not know how. Fatespeaker agreed that they should help and came up with the plan to get to the rainforest.

   Using Flame's scratch as an excuse, they tricked the guards into letting them into the rainforest, claiming that they would find the venom's antidote. He told the guards that the queen had chosen him as he was the only NightWing the RainWings trusted. The guards decided to let them in. Immediately after they came in, RainWings pinned them down, as ordered by

   . Starflight and Tsunami spotted each other, and Tsunami explained a bit of their situation and brought them to Glory, Sunny, and Clay. Fatespeaker asked who Sunny is, and soon after, they found that they were quite alike. They planned how they would do the battle and decide they would go in within a few hours. Sunny suggested a new way of fighting for RainWings: tranquilizer darts. Soon, all of the RainWings were armed with their tranquilizer darts.

  <p key="b4e32336-55d4-4359-ae35-d7dc42cd0673">
   Starflight believed he might die in the fight, so he confessed to Sunny that he loved her. She was surprised, and told him to kick some NightWings for her. The army of RainWings then went through the tunnel. Glory freed Orchid first, reuniting her and Mangrove. Glory told

   how to release the RainWings with the spear. They then went to speak to Queen Battlewinner. As they were entering her chamber, Starflight noticed the ground shaking and realized the volcano would erupt. Glory demanded that Battlewinner stop the attack, but the NightWing queen refused. Starflight came up with the idea for letting the NightWings come to the rainforest, as long as they accepted Glory as their queen. Queen Battlewinner shrieked in rage and attempted to attack them, but because she jumped out of her lava, the ice froze her insides and killed her in a matter of seconds.

When the volcano erupted, the dragons dashed through the tunnel to the rainforest as the explosion consumed Morrowseer and killed him.

   Blister was with
   Nautilus
   and Squid, who was found by the mountains after Morrowseer had left him to fend for himself. Both Nautilus and Blister wondered about Morrowseer's disappearance and why he sent Blister to a scavenger den. She realized that the dragonets may be the reason for his disappearance and vowed to kill them.
