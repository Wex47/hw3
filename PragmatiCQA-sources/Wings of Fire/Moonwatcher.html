   Moonwatcher is kind, firm,
   brave,
   determined,
   fascinating,
   and friendly. However, she is somewhat shy,
   stubborn, and constantly nervous.
   She initially had trouble interacting with others, sometimes stammering when trying to talk;
   her ability to always know what one thinks of her in mind and foresee the future often made it very difficult for her to communicate with other dragons.
   She suffered from social anxiety and was easily frightened by loud, overwhelming, and hectic situations.
   She often tried to avoid being around others by reading scrolls to calm herself down. Moonwatcher was troubled about what others would think of her and did not open up easily to her peers; however, she still looked for the good in dragons.
   She seems to be well-liked by others
   and is excited about scrolls.

  <p key="6805ff10-f75d-4dac-b8d3-8eae224cbb9f">
   Experiences with her mind-reading and the explosion of the history cave taught her to be more open with her powers and to use them for the good of other dragons instead of hiding them;
   Moonwatcher also showed her determined side on many occasions, such as when she reminded

   She is easily flustered
   and sometimes reluctant.
   She has a sort of distracted air about her most of the time, as though invisible dragons whisper in her ears while everyone else is talking.

       Later, during Kinkajou's suntime, Moonwatcher explores the school's tunnels and eventually approaches
        Mightyclaws

Moonwatcher, taking a canvas, brushes, and a few shades of blue and green paint, begins talking to him about NightWing powers and Darkstalker. Upon hearing Darkstalker's name, Mightyclaws reacts negatively, although he does answer her questions about him. He then storms out of the cave upon seeing Moonwatcher's painting, which depicts a badly-done rainforest, and snarls that the painting — in other words, Moonwatcher never having to live on the island — is why she would never be a true NightWing.

       The next day, Moonwatcher attends her first music class with her winglet, playing a mbira. Afterward, on her way to the library, Winter approaches her to ask for help with Bandit. Although Moonwatcher tries to give Winter advice on helping his pet, he eventually storms out of the library in frustration. Halfway down the tunnel to her next class, history, she is hit by an awful vision of the history cave exploding in fire, killing her friends. Although Darkstalker advises her to stay away, she hurries toward the history cave. Although managing to stop most of the other dragonets from entering, Carnelian ignores Moonwatcher's warning and goes to class anyway.

Winter, dragging Moonwatcher away from the fire, asks how she knew about the explosion. After Winter leaves, warning her to tell him how she knew by the next midnight, Moonwatcher confesses her mind-reading and visionary powers to the rest of her dismayed friends.

      <p key="7a4b5dfd-7ac7-4e30-9a30-dbe6fb0bc8c3">
       The only dragon who does not seem horrified by this is Turtle, who invites her to a large underground lake, where he pulls out a
        dragonflame cactus
        seed from her shoulder, which was stuck there by the explosion. Moonwatcher begins to fly above the water, contemplating whether or not to flee the Academy. Presumably deciding to stay, she lands on a boulder near Turtle. He suggests that she should use her mind-reading abilities to catch the arsonist, and she agrees. On their way back, they meet Tsunami and Sunny, who assure Moonwatcher and Turtle that they're trying their best to catch the dragon that caused the explosion.

      <p key="b96224cb-533c-44bc-a68b-9c3f8ca48bba">
       The next morning, Qibli approaches Moonwatcher, offering to help her find the arsonist. They start by attending an assembly in which Sunny and Clay ask the students that they give the staff two days before leaving to find the killer, followed by a speech from Starflight concerning physiological trauma. Moonwatcher then listens to Pike, Icicle, and

       When they go to the prey center, unexpectedly, a stalactite falls where Icicle and Winter are sitting, nearly impaling Icicle. There were visible claw marks along the base of the stalactite, and that was when Icicle suspected Sora as the arsonist and of trying to murder her. Moon, reading Icicle's mind, rushed to save the little

However, Icicle escaped out of a leaf window; Qibli suspected that she had gone in search of Queen Glory to kill her since Icicle might have thought that Scarlet might forgive her if she killed the dragonet she hated the most.
      </p>
      As they make plans to search for her, they discover that Winter has left Jade Mountain, taking Bandit and his cage with him. After they found Winter in the pouring rain, the Jade Winglet (except Turtle) went with Winter to find Icicle. Moon later delivered the Jade Mountain Prophecy, then confessed her powers to Winter, giving him a skyfire stone to shield his thoughts.

       Glory sends them to the tribe's hatchery so that the guards could watch them, but they end up escaping regardless. This is accomplished when Kinkajou tells the dragonets in the wingery to count to one-thousand but then remembers they cannot count, which gives them a narrower window of time. Winter uses his frostbreath to make a hole, which they all fly out of. They then find their way to the tunnel to the NightWing island. When they get there, Moon does not think this is what the prophecy meant by the 'Lost City of Night.' They find Icicle, who has been awake for days, to keep Scarlet from visiting her in her dreams. Kinkajou has left a trail for Queen Glory, who finds them, tranquilizes Icicle, saving Kinkajou in the process, and orders them all back to the Kingdom.

    He wanted her to trust him, and she was noted to be one of the very few dragons he truly cared about, not putting any spells on her and trying to convince her to understand him. Moonwatcher was Darkstalker's best friend when he emerged from Agate Mountain.
    Darkstalker refused to enchant Moonwatcher's mind as he did for most of Pyrrhia, and she believed that he was not evil. She genuinely liked him, largely due to the fact that he genuinely likes her, and he was one of the only dragons he trusted to believe in him and enjoy his company of their own accord.
    They were genuine friends,
    and Darkstalker considered a party boring because Moonwatcher did not attend.
    She believed that he was good, and that he wanted the most peaceful future for Pyrrhia,
    and she believed wholeheartedly that he would never kill her.
    He appeared genuinely wounded when she began using skyfire and protection spells against his magic. She flinches whenever she hears his name,
    although at one point they were good friends
    and she was saddened by the idea of him lying to her.

   Kinkajou is Moon's best friend and has been shown to care much about her. Moonwatcher and her were clawmates in the Jade Winglet. Moon was distraught when Kinkajou was severely injured by a mysterious companion of Scarlet's (Chameleon, in his NightWing form, Shapeshifter), showing the strong bond between them. At first, Moon was put off by Kinkajou's energetic thoughts and actions, but realized that Kinkajou really did care about her. After Kinkajou found out that Moonwatcher could read minds, she felt like her privacy was invaded majorly, and did not trust Moonwatcher for a short period of time. But after the shock wore off, Kinkajou and Moonwatcher were best friends again. She was visibly happy when she told Qibli that Kinkajou was unharmed.

   If it were up to Qibli, he would spend every day of his life flying with Moon. He recognizes subtle things about her,
    and thinks about what she would do when he needs motivation.
    Everything is less awful for him when he is with her,
    and he often wishes that she were by his side.
    When Moon was in danger, he leaped aside to protect her with his wings,
    and he looks at Moon like he loves her.
    When Qibli spoke about how free he thought Possibility was, Moon looked at him like he made sense.
    When Moonwatcher said that she was unsure if anyone would want to come with her to fulfill the Jade Mountain Prophecy, Qibli waved a wing at himself as though it were obvious.
    When Winter told Moon he should have nothing to do with her, Qibli sounded genuinely angry.
    He feels a need to know whether or not she is safe,
    and during his time away from her, he felt like he was a broken vase and she was the piece that would fit him all back together.
    He once thought that his ideal future would be as a loyal advisor to Thorn, but as he continued thinking about it, Moon appeared in the vision alongside him as his partner.
    He wants to make her smile,
    and she makes him happier than he has ever felt before.
    For Qibli, being around Moonwatcher feels like being on a team with someone who works with him and makes his own brain work better.
    He once stated that he would be there for Moon anytime she needed him,
    and thought that if Moon ever died, it would kill him as well.
    She often turns to him for physical comfort,
    and he is considerate of her needs.
    Darkstalker once mentioned that Qibli could never stay away from Moonwatcher for long.

    He removed the dragonflame seedpod from her shoulder, and she wondered if he would let her drown if she fainted. He then told her to, "Go ahead and try." This referred to flying, but Moonwatcher wondered if he was offering her an escape as well.
    She thinks that she does not know him and believes he is interesting despite what he says to the contrary.

   Moonwatcher is one of Winter's closest friends, and Winter is in love with her.
    Moonwatcher once stated that she would never be Winter's enemy, no matter what he said.
    She wanted Winter to come with her to solve the Jade Mountain Prophecy, and her face crumbled into disappointment when he refused.
    Since Winter began wearing skyfire, it is a lot easier for Moonwatcher to talk to him.
    Winter sometimes jokes with Moonwatcher,
    but he feels a twisting feeling in his chest when he thinks about her,
    and hearing her say his name was described to be like a spell that runs warmth through his bones.
    Winter had never met anyone who seemed to be as interested in scavengers as he was until he met Moonwatcher.
    She is determined to support Winter whether he wants her help or not,
    and Winter has had quiet thoughts about how Moonwatcher is different from the other NightWings, and perhaps different than most dragons in Pyrrhia.
    His expression while looking at her once was soulful and full of tortured longing.
    He quite likes her,
    and misses her dearly after moving to Sanctuary.
  </p>
  <p key="0c54a485-3bcf-4ca1-8da6-ca407ac9d506">
   Winter once thought that where Narwhal and Tundra saw Winter as nothing more than a gray lump of ice, Moonwatcher saw dazzling mountain peaks,
    and she regards him as one of the best dragons in Pyrrhia.
    Moonwatcher finds Winter's mind to be very confusing,
    but Moonwatcher regards Winter as someone who can think bigger than the things that affect him personally.
    She trusts Winter
    and thinks that he is honorable and brave,
    and Winter felt a rush of gratitude for her understanding of how important rescuing Hailstorm was to him.
    Winter often cannot tell when Moonwatcher is joking,
    but he looks at her in a loving way,
    and felt hollowed out when he pictured her and Qibli together.
    He was afraid of what he might say to her alone in the dark.
    Winter's heart told him to rescue Moonwatcher when their group was attacked by Shapeshifter,
    and while he initially felt guilty about being Moonwatcher's friend under the judgement of Hailstorm, he felt a second wave of guilt after realizing how much Moonwatcher had done to help him.
    After Narwhal and Tundra intended for Winter to die during the Diamond Trial, he thought that Moonwatcher would never have done something like that to him,
    and he becomes his best self around her.
  </p>
  <p key="fe25f81f-710b-4306-afe2-c686cbaddcb6">
   However, Winter acted harshly
    and explosively angry and caused Moonwatcher to flare up during their argument about Darkstalker;
    Qibli wondered how he could yell at Moonwatcher the way he did, if he truly loved her,
    and Kinkajou admitted that he had been mean towards her when he yelled at her or did not believe in her.
    When Moonwatcher chose Qibli over Winter, he was heartbroken and wondered how long it would take his heart to heal.
