   MudWings have thick, armored scales. They are usually earthy colors, such as browns, ambers, and oranges. They are most known for their flat snouts, brute strength, and large size. They may also have gold or amber underscales, usually more visible in sunlight.
   Their nostrils are located on the top of the snouts, allowing them to lay submerged in mud for long periods of time. They have thick, curved horns and broad, flat heads. Their eyes have been described as brown, gold, and amber, sometimes with brownish-yellow rings around the pupils. Their bodies are muscular and robust, being based on crocodiles.
   They are typically larger and stronger than dragons of other tribes. MudWings may also have odd markings such as dappled scales.

  <p key="8bd6ac47-9796-429d-af80-8f7e4dd74811">
   MudWings seem willing to eat nearly anything, including both fruit and meat. In the marshes, they eat crocodiles and other swamp-dwelling creatures. They have a bigger appetite than other tribes, possibly because of the energy needed to maintain such large stature. MudWings may have an interest in agriculture or farming.

   MudWings can hold their breath for up to an hour. When they are warm enough, they can breathe fire.
   Thanks to their muscular bodies, MudWings are quite strong. They are capable of camouflaging into mud and dirt and may rest while partially submerged.
   MudWings can use mud to ease pain and help treat wounds.
  </p>
  <p key="529a4d5d-c8b6-4414-a3f5-6bf9ab81aa19">
   MudWings that hatch from blood-red eggs are immune to fire. This power fully activates after exposure to mud. Though fire will still hurt them, any injuries caused by fire will rapidly heal. If a burn is too deep or large, however, it will not heal all the way.
   This ability will not heal deep flesh wounds or internal wounds and is mostly limited to a dragon's scales. Fireproof MudWings may be able to survive in lava for short periods.
   When burned, a fire-immune MudWing's scales will temporarily fade to black before returning to the dragon's normal scale color.

   MudWings live in large mud bunkhouses that house several dragons, usually siblings.
   They also tend to lie around and nap in large mud puddles.
   Additionally, MudWings are often perceived as unintelligent, although this is a stereotype.
   MudWings also have not been ambitious compared to other tribes. It has been awhile since they had a queen who was interested in conquering others.
  </p>
  <p key="68ad32a0-d0cb-4700-9291-740d7bffddc1">
   Pairings are not formal, with a breeding night once a month.
   Neither parent takes part in raising their children, and often the two partners will not know one another or their children in any way.
   MudWings lay their eggs in well-protected bunkhouses with mud walls and warm rocks for incubation. Eggs are left mostly alone, and oftentimes no adults are present during hatchings. The first MudWing dragonet to hatch is often the largest and is known as a bigwings. They will help their siblings out of their eggs.
  </p>
  <p key="f0603b51-d1e3-4031-8577-9ea53ad648b4">
   MudWings live in troops of siblings, with the bigwings as the caretaker and leader. These sib groups love and trust one another a great deal and work well as units of soldiers. They also protect one another and feel the loss of a sibling deeply.
   When a sibling is killed or lost, a sib group may take in another dragon who has been orphaned from their own group, known as "unsibs." Several unsibs may gather to form their own troop.
