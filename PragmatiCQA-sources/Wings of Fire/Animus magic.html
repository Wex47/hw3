   Animus magic was almost limitless, being capable of moving objects
   to controlling other dragons.
   Despite its capabilities, animus magic was unable to bring back the dead.
   If two animus dragons cast two spells directly in conflict with each other, the one who is older, more powerful, more practiced and experienced, and focused is likely to win, and what exactly was enchanted would have an effect as well.
   Heavy use of animus magic can unintentionally alter the landscape where it was cast.

   It was thought that using any animus magic could cause insanity,

   once mentioned that animus magic also hurts an animus dragon's soul if it is used for personal gain.
   However, the books imply that the animus magic does affect the soul, as
