   , all alive and current animus dragons cannot cast new spells, and very likely will never be able to again, due to the spell cast by
   Jerboa III
   . This does not however imply that animus magic itself is destroyed, and newborn animus dragons by Jerboa III's phrasing should be able to cast new spells, as previously enchanted objects still work.

   Animus magic was almost limitless, being capable of moving objects
   to controlling other dragons.
   Despite its capabilities, animus magic was unable to bring back the dead.
   If two animus dragons cast two spells directly in conflict with each other, the one who is older, more powerful, more practiced and experienced, and focused is likely to win, and what exactly was enchanted would have an effect as well.
   Heavy use of animus magic can unintentionally alter the landscape where it was cast.

   It was thought that using any animus magic could cause insanity,
   though it has been heavily implied that this only happens if an animus dragon uses their magic for evil.
   Turtle
   once mentioned that animus magic also hurts an animus dragon's soul if it is used for personal gain.
   However, the books imply that the animus magic does affect the soul, as

   Both
   Darkstalker
   and
   Anemone
   attempted to prevent this through enchantments, but this did not seem to have any bearing on their eventual actions or the deterioration of their souls.
   Darkstalker had also tried this two thousand years ago with his

    was asked for the inspiration for animus magic, she replied: "So with animus magic, it started with thinking, I needed some kind of magic in this world, but I didn't want it to be like anyone can have any magic at any time, I wanted it to be sort of specific, and have it be pretty rare. And then, especially with
