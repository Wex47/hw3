    By recess, Luna was in the grip of one of the worst sadnesses she'd ever felt. She knew she couldn't let herself cry at school, and if she escaped out the front gates and ran back to the safety of the webs, she'd only be in worse trouble later.

   But her wrist hurt, and her heart hurt, and she didn't know how she would make it through the rest of the day.

    "Recess" apparently meant standing or marching around an open balcony on the side of the Cicada Hive. It was boring, but at least there was sunlight and wind. Luna tried to breathe in all the air she could fit into her lungs.

    "Bit close to the edge there, aren’t you?" an older voice growled. She turned, and saw one of the HiveWing guards approaching a student who was looking out at the savannah. The little SilkWing was not all that close to the balcony railing, and he blinked up at the HiveWing in confusion.

    "Seems a little dangerous, worm," the HiveWing smirked, looming over the wingless dragonet. He inched back, and she stepped closer. The balcony edge was a few steps behind him now.

    The balcony railing was only as high as the students' wingbuds. It looked like it had been built as an afterthought. "Oh right, SilkWing dragonets have no wings, we should pretend we care about their safety. But don't waste too much treestuff on this since we don't really." It would not be hard to fall over it, or be pushed over it.

    "Stop that!" Luna said. She was startled to hear her own voice lancing through the silk fog around her. It felt like bright little flames of anger were burning holes in her sadness. "Why are you being so mean? You're scaring him just to be awful!"

    Most of the other SilkWing students stared at her with wide, terrified eyes. The HiveWing flicked her tail, where a dangerous looking [sic] stinger gleamed, and turned her head slowly to glare at Luna.

    There were audible gasps from the rest of the class, who started edging away as fast as they could sidle. The HiveWing stepped towards her, and raised her tail menacingly. Glider slipped away from the railing and bolted back into the school, but the guard didn't notice.

    "Oh no!" shouted a voice on the far side of the balcony. Everyone hustled out of the way as the guard whirled around. The shouting dragonet was a little bit older than Luna. He was dark blue, with several small white triangular scales, and larger orange splotches. And he was standing on the railing of the balcony!
