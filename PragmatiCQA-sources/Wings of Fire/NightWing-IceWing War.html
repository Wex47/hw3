   Starclaws

   Prudence
   on a diplomatic visit to the

   Prudence brought her daughter Foeslayer along, predicting that she might fall in love with Prince Arctic of the IceWings, bringing
   animus
   genes to the NightWings, and that was what happened. Arctic fled with the NightWings to their kingdom, which resulted in the loss of animus magic in the IceWing tribe. The IceWings saw Arctic's runaway as a kidnapping, thus sparking the war.

    Sometime during the war, Queen
