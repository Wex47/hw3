   Qibli has pale,
   light,
   sand-yellow scales,
   with a few tiny
   dark brown speckles on his snout
   and yellow wings.
   He has a small, rakish scar zigzagging across his snout
   and wears a shiny, warm,
   small gold hoop earring in one ear with one warm orange-amber teardrop hanging from it.
   He is scruffy,
   scrawny,
   wiry, narrow-shouldered,
   and slightly larger than
   Kinkajou

   He has sharp eyes.

  <p key="3168993a-7252-423c-a1d1-55970bdb707c">
   Qibli often makes witty jokes
   and clever observations,
   and tries to get along with everyone, especially upon first meeting them.
   He is intelligent
   and sincere, using his brain to solve problems
   and open about his feelings.
   He is friendly
   and observant,
   and
   Winter
   once thought that if anyone could solve the mystery of
   Pyrite
   , it would probably be Qibli.
  </p>
  <p key="12a93758-d81b-4e00-89ac-d474b80c6e6a">
   He is funny, interesting,
   honest,
   practical,
   charming,
   selfless,
   stubborn,
   honest,
   compassionate,
   talkative, observant,
   gentle,
   excitable,
   optimistic,
   fair,
   peculiar,
   clever,
   hopeful, cheerful,
   and enthusiastic.
   When others are in danger, he becomes genuinely concerned, his voice suddenly gentle instead of playful.
   Moonwatcher observed that he is often thinking about several things at once.
   He cares about other dragons very deeply,
   and wants to be considered significant.
   He is often tempted to steal things, due to his Outclaw upbringing,
   and his thoughts are complicated
   and careening.
   He is not a sneak, and refuses to betray those he loves, even by pretending to.
   Qibli is accustomed to simpler tastes, and when he sees decorative wealth, he is only reminded of how it could have instead been used to help other dragons.
   He is reasonable, but does not like to be described as normal,
   and he knows how to play tricks with his words.
   He is also willing to push aside rationality in order to help others.
   He loves meeting new dragons and trying to read them, and he is always considering how other dragons think and what they are like on the inside.
   His brain is organized
   and his thoughts are constant,
   and he is willing to admit to and apologize when he is in the wrong.
   He is intelligent and has several big ideas,
   but the desire to be liked lies underneath everything he does.
  </p>
  <p key="05719f84-0f2c-41e5-add0-b536dfd1f4fc">
   Despite his external good nature, Qibli has been deeply affected by his abusive relationships with
   Cobra
   ,
   Sirocco
   , and
   Rattlesnake
   , and although he often tries to drown out their voices out by focusing on his life as an Outclaw, the smallest things can bring painful memories crashing back in.
   He constantly faces insecurity about being ordinary, small, insignificant, and useless.
   He desperately wants other dragons to like him,
   and cannot seem to resist dragons who smile at him or seem to enjoy his company.
   He often feels anxious
   or blames himself very harshly whenever he makes a mistake.

      Six-Claws
      were among the first to rush to her defense, although Thorn herself had already stabbed Preyhunter with her deadly tail.

       Later, he followed Thorn and

       through the city as they discussed the "Wanted" posters. When they reached Thorn's tent, Qibli stubbornly told Thorn that he was not going to leave her alone with Sunny because she was, at that time, a stranger. When a messenger informed Thorn of a fire near the orphanage, Qibli and Sunny are left alone together for a short amount of time. During that time, Qibli lectures Sunny about the Outclaws, but she falls asleep shortly after Thorn's departure.
      </p>
      When the Outclaws had attacked
      Burn's stronghold
      on behalf of Sunny, he fought alongside Thorn and Six-Claws, narrowly saving Thorn's life by pushing a rival SandWing soldier away.

        Carnelian
        from going inside, lying and saying that it was because it smelled bad. When the cave blew up, Qibli then defended Moon a third time from Winter when he asked her how she knew. Qibli found out that Moon was a mind reader, thinking that she thought of him as a terrible dragon, or maybe even realized his feelings for her and then ran off. The next day, he told Moon that he wanted to help her find the murderer who was terrorizing so many dragons.

Moon begged her not to kill him, and Winter overheard the conversation and questioned his sister. Icicle warned Winter to stay out of her way. Moon heard Icicle's thoughts as Qibli got too close to her and shot frostbreath at them as she shoved him out of the way. Moon took the hit on the edge of her wing, then Icicle smashed Starflight's head, knocking him out. Moon landed next to him, making sure he was alive. Qibli threw himself at Icicle, and she threw Qibli on top of a desk, which he slid behind. Icicle then went for Moon, and Winter tried to get her off, but Icicle was bigger and stronger. Icicle then stated Starflight was the reason the

        Hailstorm
        was alive, she was working with Scarlet to get him back. She then flew out the window while Winter shouted for her to come back. Qibli got back up, with bruises all over his face and his earring nearly torn off. He thought about how disappointed Thorn would be if she saw him get knocked out by an IceWing.

      Later, Qibli was shown when Moon asked
       Turtle
       to give all of the Jade Winglet skyfire. When they wondered where Winter was, Qibli told them that he left and was not in their cave.

      Qibli annoyed Winter by making clever observations about Winter's plans but still wanted to be friends. Winter got rid of Turtle, and Qibli said that he could not get rid of the rest of them as easily. This annoyed Winter very much, but he "allowed" them to follow. They all ended up flying to the

        Avalanche

Pyrite claimed to know where it is when they mentioned that they were looking for Scarlet. Winter observed that Qibli had feelings for Moon and wondered if his feelings were as obviously shown as Winter's.

       When they found the mountain Moon saw in the dream, they took a short rest. Winter was dreamvisited by Scarlet, which meant she was spying on them. They look around and find a shredded camp and one of Scarlet's scales, and they discover she had been there. They started looking until they found a cave, and while Kinkajou and Pyrite were still sleeping, they crept up on Scarlet and
        her companion
        and overheard her yelling at her companion and ordering him to bring Pyrite to her. When they got back to camp, Winter confronted Pyrite, and she attacked him. Qibli fought her while Winter and Moon fought Scarlet's companion. Qibli pinned Pyrite to the ground, and Winter tore off the necklace that she had previously refused to remove. Qibli jumped back at the sight of her scales falling off to reveal Hailstorm. However, Kinkajou was severely injured by ex-Queen Scarlet's NightWing companion.

      When they got to the town of
       Possibility
       so that they could take Kinkajou to the hospital, Winter got worried about Hailstorm's confusion and decided to wear the necklace so he could know what Hailstorm was going through. Before he could do so, Qibli tore off number four of the conditions, which roughly was, "feels the need to wear this necklace with life/death urgency." When Winter put the necklace on, he turned into Pyrite. When Qibli asked him if he could have the necklace back, Pyrite gave it to him, and Winter appeared again. Winter decided to go back to the
       Ice Kingdom
       , and Qibli tried to reason with him, but Winter ignored him, and Qibli gave him a week to come back to them. When Winter was leaving, Qibli called out, "Don't be a stranger!"

Qibli was suspicious of Peril and said to Moon after she told Peril that Qibli was "probably the smartest dragon in Pyrrhia" and had already come up with five ways to kill her by then.

Qibli got pushed aside by Turtle as he worked with his animus-touched river stone. He asked why Turtle had "a magic healing rock." He quickly figured it out and exclaimed that Turtle must be an

      Qibli watched Darkstalker emerge from the

He then asked Winter if he was alright when Winter suddenly forgave Darkstalker easily, unlike his usual demeanor. When they left to go hunting due to Darkstalker's insistence, he gave Turtle a meaningful look and pointed to Jade Mountain, trying to signal to him to warn the school.

       instead of worrying about it, then asked Turtle if he was like that around Moon. When Turtle was puzzled, he immediately said "never mind" to him and told him that he did not know yet if Darkstalker was evil, and Turtle should keep a lookout. When Turtle went to see Winter and Qibli, Qibli mentioned how odd it was for Winter to act this forgiving. After Winter stormed out, Qibli reluctantly asked Turtle if he could make him an animus but immediately dismissed it when he saw Turtle's reaction and instead asked for a spell on his earring that would shield him from all of Darkstalker's enchantments. Turtle does, and when Qibli tried it on, he mentioned that he felt more connected to himself, proving that Darkstalker made an enchantment that made everyone like and trust him; however, Turtle thinks it may just be a psychological effect. When Darkstalker came, knowing that a spell had been cast, he asked Qibli if
        Anemone
        had passed by at all. When Qibli realized that Darkstalker could sense animus spells being cast, he said he did not think she had but suggested that she might have. Darkstalker asked Qibli to tell his history scroll to roll up to test if he has animus powers, and when it did not work, Darkstalker informed Qibli that he would have made a formidable animus with his mind.

      When Turtle planned to follow Darkstalker and Anemone to the rainforest, Turtle gave him one of his enchanted slates. These slates were enchanted so that when Turtle got a writing idea, he would write it on one slate, and the writing would appear on the other. After Turtle left, Turtle sent him messages several times. Turtle told Anemone to find Qibli for help when Darkstalker summoned all the animus dragons from Pyrrhia.

       In a flashback, Cobra snapped at Qibli that he would never amount to much, and she discouraged him from trying to be a hero, as he would only fail after he delivered to her a coconut that he stole from a fight between a cat and mouse earlier in the day. She beat him with Thorn watching. Thorn then proceeded to take Qibli away from his home and mother (who happily agreed) and into cities unknown to him. She asked him what he did to the spiny mouse as he set the mouse free. Thorn assumed he had rescued it and complimented him on his cleverness, saying his skills were what she wanted in her organization.

      <p key="64bb077a-0ee1-4167-9ac4-c0264fa8d2f5">
       Qibli noted that ever since that day, Thorn had his complete trust and loyalty. However, he now thinks of Moon just as much, if not more than he thinks about Thorn, and wondered if Moon would ever love him back with the same hopefulness he used to show toward Cobra. Qibli then snapped out of his pondering and flew up to Winter, who was sorrowfully watching Moon fly away with Darkstalker and his followers. Qibli, while he is observing how Winter was watching Moon fly away, thought about how Moon would choose Winter and his beautiful scales and heroic personality over himself. When Winter caught Qibli watching him, he claimed that he was watching the sunset, and Qibli sarcastically responded that the sunset was the only interesting thing. Winter then said that once Moon comes back with the others, everything would be normal again, but Qibli disagreed, asking how things could be normal if Winter returned to school after faking death to his tribe. Winter said he never planned on going back to the school, and Qibli realized he came back because Moonwatcher was there. Qibli decided that he needed to break the supposed spell that Darkstalker cast on Winter, for Winter's sake and Moon's, but he struggled to find out how. Qibli then realized that he could duplicate his enchanted earring using Turtle's duplicating bowl. Qibli then brought the bowl out, only to realize he did not know how to use it. Peril walked by, and with her, he figured out how to use the bowl. With his new enchanted earrings, Qibli confronted Winter and tried to give him one, but Winter was clear he would not put anything magic on him after what happened to Hailstorm. Qibli scolded himself for not guessing Winter would be a stubborn, "stupid donkey."

       about his sister Icicle, who was a murderer and collaborating with ex-Queen Scarlet. Qibli soon realized that Onyx and Ostrich were not there in the cave with them while defending Winter. He found this troubling, as Ostrich particularly liked all her lessons, along with the fact that Sunny peeked in, got a worried look, and hurried on. Webs agreed eventually to tell the dragonets about Darkstalker if they stopped fighting. When Qibli stated that Webs' claim about Darkstalker being humble and unambitious was now wrong, Winter disagreed with him. He said that it was not like Darkstalker had demanded to be NightWing king immediately. Ironically, the slate that Turtle enchanted began writing the words "Darkstalker wants to be NightWing king" across its surface, and Qibli had to restrain himself from laughing.

      <p key="fc7bad47-6412-4875-9d0d-fd58e7cefe4d">
       Sunny asked Webs to give her Qibli and gave him worrying news; Ostrich and Onyx had gone missing. Qibli hurriedly made multiple earrings through Turtle's enchanted food bowl. When he looked for the dragonets of destiny to give the shield earrings to them, he found out through Sunny's dream-visiting that his grandfather
        Vulture
        had Ostrich in the Scorpion Den. He argued with Clay in the weapons cave about how he could not face his grandfather with only three daggers, a sword, and a big stick, saying if he went to him unarmed, it would be like "cutting his own throat and hanging his corpse from an alley wall." He was then interrupted by Winter, who offered to go with him. Qibli claimed that it is because Winter adored him. While Winter muttered about how his plan was already backfiring, Qibli worried about how Winter was under Darkstalker's spell and might be spying on him for the evil animus NightWing. But he decided to let Winter come along, thinking that later he may get Winter to wear his earring. Winter and Qibli set off to the Scorpion Den.

       When they landed, Qibli worried about how the shadows stalking them did not do anything but watch, and he hurried to his old home. There he cannot find Cobra but was met by his siblings Sirocco and Rattlesnake. They had acquired new tattoos like Vulture's and took Qibli and Winter into
        Vulture's compound
        . There they found Vulture watching two scavengers in a maze. Winter defended them, and Vulture waved away the guards and the scavengers. He also started the train of thought to lead Qibli into figuring out the truth about Onyx - that she was Prince

        and
        Palm
        's daughter. He also said that she would be challenging Thorn for the throne. Vulture noted that Cobra, Qibli's mother, was imprisoned in an oubliette for giving Qibli away. Vulture then demanded that Qibli give away all of Thorn's secrets for his friends', mother's, and own release. Qibli pretended to write down Thorn's secrets in a scroll, stalling, then he made more throwing stars from the one Ostrich swiped in Turtle's doubling bowl while his mother caused a scene. They then escaped and left for Thorn's palace, where Qibli found Thorn, Smolder, and
        Typhoon
        , a SeaWing-IceWing hybrid from Possibility. Typhoon talked about how all the IceWings in the settlement had gotten suspiciously sick. Qibli suggested giving enchanted earrings to the staff (Thorn and her subjects), and more for Typhoon to take to all the IceWings in Possibility and the Ice Kingdom to be free from Darkstalker's plague and spells. Qibli suddenly ordered the Outclaws to pin Cobra to the ground and looks in her bag, finding weapons and poison. Accusing Cobra that she was not really in the oubliette all that time, and it was a setup to get close to Thorn. Afterward, Winter jumped into the air to get Darkstalker to heal the whole IceWing tribe being under Darkstalker's spell. Qibli tried to get Winter to wear the earring so Winter could be free from the Darkstalker's spell. Winter objects to this loudly, and in the process, freezes Qibli's arm, causing him to pass out, right after Thorn jabbed an earring in Winter's ear. However, directly before Qibli passes out, he called Winter a friend and asked Thorn to get earrings for everybody.

       Thorn's doctors healed Qibli's arm, and he woke up in a room with Winter, who grudgingly apologized for fighting with Qibli. Qibli got to work making more protection earrings, even though Typhoon had already left with the two still in Qibli's bag to give to the sick IceWings. Winter watched as he doubled his earring in Turtle's bowl and asked if Qibli was secretly an animus dragon also (along with their clawmate, Turtle). Qibli thought darkly of how Winter took his one chance with the enchanted scroll away and responded instead with a mention of Turtle's magic. They make many more protection spells for all of Thorn's staff and the IceWings. Thorn walked into the room and asked what Qibli was doing but, after watching him, corrected herself with a more specific question of

        how
       </i>
       . Qibli explained, and Thorn asked why they could not just have Qibli's animus friend stop Darkstalker with a spell. Qibli said that magic could, but the particular dragon could not. She also asked for some earrings to give to

       </a>
       and "Mudhen" (a typo for
        Moorhen
        ). Winter joked awkwardly about how they would inflict Qibli's terrible fashion sense on the whole continent. They planned on who would take the earrings to wear, and Thorn told Qibli and Winter that she would handle it with her messengers.

      <p key="eed10463-52d3-4b4a-a8c4-e31ee1b80ade">
       They then returned to the balconies and found out that the
        Talons of Power
        , Vulture's followers, were filling the skies fighting the Outclaws, and the "nightmarish shape" of Vulture holding the
       <a href="Eye of Onyx.html" key="43d10be0-2854-4b3b-83a6-d368cb809591" title="Eye of Onyx">
        Eye of Onyx
       </a>
       that he stole from the treasury. He gave a speech, stopping the fight, and wrongly shaped Qibli's words that he yelled at Vulture in his favor. Vulture claimed that the threat of the bombing was the MudWings, and says that he had proof. He is cut off by Queen Thorn, who told him to bring the MudWing to her for questioning instead of illegally taking him into custody and for a real SandWing duel in the dueling grounds if there was a serious challenger. Vulture counters by claiming he had the Eye of Onyx, so there was no need, but Thorn revealed that that one was just a fake that she kept for fooling thieves and saving their lives while she was wearing the real one. Vulture tried to fight back by questioning whether the one Thorn wore was the real one, and she calmly responded that the real Eye of Onyx killed anyone not worthy of the throne and that it had not killed her yet. Qibli caught that she implied Vulture would be dead if it were not a replica. Winter muttered to Qibli the connection around Onyx's name to the eye of Onyx, and Qibli frantically searched for Onyx in the crowds of SandWings all around him. He spied a flicker of movement and shrieked to Thorn that she's right below her. He dived towards her, and Thorn fended off her attacker. She told Qibli not to hurt Onyx, and he found it hard not to protect his queen more, protesting. Onyx claimed the crown should be hers, and Thorn scoffed, saying Onyx should fight her like a real queen and that "this crown will never fall to a sneaking, sulking, shadow-killer."

      <p key="4540559f-4108-460e-8c54-48bc8ea3cd2c">
       They went to the arena grounds, where Smolder, Onyx's father, talked to Onyx. Qibli was worried that since Onyx was truly royal blood, the Eye of Onyx might choose her, causing him to try and call up a storm that would delay the battle. He regretted it instantly after using Anemone's magic bracelets, but it was too strong and made a sandstorm. Thorn raced to get everyone inside, and they lost Onyx, Vulture, and Smolder in the process. Once they were all safe, Qibli and Thorn went looking for them and find Onyx and Smolder in the dungeons, where Onyx was injured. Smolder was scared of the "mad prisoner" who is
        Prickle
        , Palm's sister, and Onyx's aunt. Ostrich and Six-Claws find another entrance from the outside of the dungeons, and they made it back outside, where Qibli saw all the damage he had done. He vowed not to use the bracelets again, as Thorn scolded him earlier for "controlling" the weather.
      </p>
      During the fall of Jade Mountain, Qibli also provided Princess Anemone with a spell to stop the battling NightWings and IceWings at the
       Battle of Jade Mountain
       , then Darkstalker takes him to the cave he was trapped in and offered to make him an animus. Qibli turns him down and is rescued by Moon and Kinkajou and later oversaw the fall of Darkstalker with Moon,
       Foeslayer
       , and Kinkajou. He is seen in the epilogue when Moon ask him to come back to Jade Mountain and wants to be a couple with him.

       for the first time along with Moonwatcher, his new girlfriend. Qibli was shocked to see a dragon from Pantala for the first time and commented on how Luna had so many wings and asked if it was hard to fly with all those wings, then answered his question, saying that it was a silly question. When Luna told them that they needed to get her home, Qibli told her that he "had some ideas" to get her back to Pantala.

   Cobra is scornful towards her son, and reminded Qibli during his youth that he was useless and a waste of scales. He still hears her voice all of the time, reminding him about how wretched she thinks he is.
    He followed behind her like a little trail of footprints when he was young,
    and often wished desperately for her to show approval or affection towards her,
    but Cobra did not care at all what he did or how he was affected.
    He often tried to prove to her that he was a dragon good enough to be worth loving, and often made things up in his head to try and convince himself that Cobra cared about him.
    Cobra considers him a half witted idiot with crazy ideas,
    completely ordinary and useless, and doubts his ability to ever do anything important,
    but he still desperately desires for her to want and care for him.
    Later on, she snapped at him even while pretending to be loving towards him in order to infiltrate the SandWing stronghold.
    After her betrayal, Qibli fought to keep a tremor out of his voice
    and reflected on how he had always wanted to trust her,
    but she had lied to him throughout his entire life.

   If it were up to Qibli, he would spend every day of his life flying with Moon. He recognizes subtle things about her,
    and thinks about what she would do when he needs motivation.
    Everything is less awful for him when he is with her,
    and he often wishes that she were by his side.
    When Moon was in danger, he leaped aside to protect her with his wings,
    and he looks at Moon like he loves her.
    When Qibli spoke about how free he thought Possibility was, Moon looked at him like he made sense.
    When Moonwatcher said that she was unsure if anyone would want to come with her to fulfill the Jade Mountain Prophecy, Qibli waved a wing at himself as though it were obvious.
    When Winter told Moon he should have nothing to do with her, Qibli sounded genuinely angry.
    He feels a need to know whether or not she is safe,
    and during his time away from her, he felt like he was a broken vase and she was the piece that would fit him all back together.
    He once thought that his ideal future would be as a loyal advisor to Thorn, but as he continued thinking about it, Moon appeared in the vision alongside him as his partner.
    He wants to make her smile,
    and she makes him happier than he has ever felt before.
    For Qibli, being around Moonwatcher feels like being on a team with someone who works with him and makes his own brain work better.
    He once stated that he would be there for Moon anytime she needed him,
    and thought that if Moon ever died, it would kill him as well.
    She often turns to him for physical comfort,
    and he is considerate of her needs.

    Thorn brought Qibli as her SandWing advisor during a meeting with her fellow queens,
    and although she looked worried when Qibli suggested traveling to Pantala, she agreed that he was the best choice.
    Qibli thinks of himself as Thorn's second-in-command.
    Thorn unofficially adopted him as a young dragonet, and assured him that while he was under her care, he would be wanted and cared for.
    She is friendly towards him, and after she complimented his cleverness,
    she won his eternal undying loyalty.
    Thorn trusts him
    and he is filled with rage whenever she is spoken negatively of.
    He refused to betray her, even by pretending to, despite being threatened by Vulture and his Talons of Power,
    and she has taught him things that have made him stronger.
    He wants to protect Thorn at all costs,
    and her face lights up when she sees him, although she can also be stern in certain circumstances.
    She is his leader and his friend, and she changed his life.

    Vulture's punishment for stealing from him would be certain death,

    Vulture was deceptive

    and is self-conscious about Moonwatcher preferring Winter over himself.
    However, after Winter saved Qibli's life, he was grateful in his thanks, entirely too sincerely for Winter.
    Qibli looked to Winter like he was waiting for him to decide whether or not to reveal important information.
    He also purposefully paired Moonwatcher and Winter together during the search for Hailstorm in hopes that searching with her would keep Winter going.
    Qibli has helped Winter become less serious, and had an irrepressible grin on his face when speaking to Winter in Sanctuary. Qibli considers him a best friend and is affectionate
    and genuinely delighted towards him.
    Winter sometimes looks at Qibli as though he will never understand him,
    but he genuinely likes Qibli, and considers him a best friend.
