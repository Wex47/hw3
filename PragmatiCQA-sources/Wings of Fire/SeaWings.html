   SeaWings are considered short in height
   and have long, compact bodies with short legs. They have curved horns, a slender, curved snout, and two barbels on the underside of their jaw. Their tongues can be forked or unforked. They have webbed spines along the backs of their necks to the tips of their tails, as well as on their chests. SeaWings have webbed talons with hooked claws, as well as long, powerful tails. They have gills on the sides of their necks that allow them to breathe underwater.
  </p>
  <p key="79c9d016-bc16-4689-beaf-18809e24e4fb">
   SeaWings commonly have scale colors in the ranges of blues and greens, including indigo,
   green-gray,
   blue-gray,
   and blue-green.
   Although rare, dragons may have pink
   or yellow-green scales and/or webbing membranes.
   Black spiraling patterns, like those shown in
   Nautilus
   , may also be present. In the sunlight, their scales may look like glossy emeralds and sapphires.
   SeaWings usually have eyes that are some shade of blue or green.
  </p>
  <p key="54e3b299-51d7-4eb3-a16d-63d00b36864f">
   SeaWings have glowing stripes along their faces, bodies, and wings. Members of the royal family have glowing spiral and starburst markings on the undersides of their wings, while most non-royal SeaWings have smaller starbursts and no spiral patterns.
  </p>
  <p key="2168bc66-57aa-46ae-98c5-4169e5df16bf">
   SeaWing eggs are green or blue, have striped or swirl-like patterns,
   and are kept underwater in warm hatcheries,
   as warmth (especially right before hatching) is important.
   They are heavy, particularly soon before they hatch.

   while lower class SeaWings eat eels, though this is stated insultingly.
   SeaWings may also prepare soup,

   SeaWings have gills, exceptional night vision,
   and powerful tails. They are able to breathe and see underwater and use their tails, wings, and webbed talons to swim.
   Their claws are curved like fishhooks,
   and their tails can be used to batter opponents or create huge waves.
   SeaWings often ride currents to travel the ocean faster,
   and they prefer to alternate swimming and flying when traveling long distances.
   Physical wounds, such as burns, can be healed by ocean water.

  <p key="47af26a9-60ff-4b32-9ebd-919c35a5df57">
   The bioluminescent stripes on a SeaWing's body are used to converse underwater,
   as well as to attract partners.
   They can control when the stripes on their bodies glow, and can light up each one individually. Different combinations of stripes indicate different words in Aquatic.

   SeaWings can be driven mad if dehydrated from water.

   There are no rules on how much magic a SeaWing can use, and animus dragons are often controlled closely by the queen of the tribe.
