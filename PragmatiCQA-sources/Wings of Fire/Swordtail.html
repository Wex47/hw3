   He has dark blue eyes,

   He is dotted all over with orange splotches, as though someone melted a sunset in a cauldron and flung it over his wings. While living in Cicada Hive, he is often covered in dirt, with fragments of treestuff caught between his claws and tangled between his long, elegant horns.

      Swordtail was mentioned in the first few chapters as someone known for being a troublemaker. He first appeared at his girlfriend Luna's
      Metamorphosis
      , displaying his trouble-making skills. When Luna had woven her cocoon, and the guards began to get closer, Swordtail jumped down from the balcony to attack the
      HiveWing
      guards and protect Luna. He was put in Misbehaver's Way for this, where
      Cricket
      later freed him with a stimulant that inadvertently gave him super strength, extra energy, green eyes, green silk, and extremely hyper behavior. He and Cricket flew away to the safety of a sinkhole in the savanna not far from one of the Hives, while he carried a wingless Blue using his super strength. The symptoms wore off a little while later, so to get Blue out, he had to shoot silk webs under him.
They then traveled towards
      Wasp Hive
      , where Swordtail suggested his "plan," in which he would storm in, knock over the guards, and demand to know where Luna is. They eventually agreed to hide in a greenhouse near Wasp Hive, which had a sign saying no one but the queen was allowed in. However, the three were captured by a trio of LeafWings,
      Belladonna
      ,
      Hemlock
      , and Sundew, and to not be killed. They were forced to help steal the
      Book of Clearsight
      . They discussed whether or not to abide by their captors' wishes. Swordtail did not know of Cricket and Blue's idea to pretend to agree and escape later, so he voiced his own opinions. Cricket and Blue left him behind with the two older LeafWings while they traveled with Sundew to steal the book. Later, he teamed up with Cricket and Sundew to rescue Blue and Luna from the
      flamesilk
      cavern. The two were able to escape, and Swordtail reunited with his lover. They fled the hives and ended up on a beach, where he flew with Luna to test out her new wings. Suddenly, a patrol group of HiveWings arrived and fought him, Luna, and Sundew. Luna tried to protect herself with her flamesilk but accidentally created a sail which allowed her to be blown out to sea. Swordtail flew after Luna, trying to rescue her, but was unable to find her.

       Later, he is dragged into the cave unconscious by Sundew, who had Cricket crush reddish plants under his snout to wake him up. After he woke up, he flew all around the bay, stopping only for sleep in short bursts. He discusses with Cricket and Sundew about the Chrysalis and shutting down mind control and gathers fruit and water for Blue once he breaks out of his cocoon. Swordtail watches as Blue comes out and admires his wings, although scrutinizing them for being "not as handsome as mine, of course, but pretty cool." He flies with them to
       Jewel Hive
       , and spends the night in the market with his friends. They steal jewelry in the market, but Blue leaves flamesilk to pay for it.

      Swordtail was one of the dragons who flew to the
      Poison Jungle
      along with Sundew, and shortly after arrival, was trapped and almost eaten by a dragon-trap. Blue attempted saving him by shooting flamesilk at the plant, but this only resulted in a fire. Sundew had to use her leafspeak to put it out, which resulted in the freeing of Swordtail. Sundew had previously predicted Swordtail would be eaten first, as she had said to him: "Yeah,

       After Sundew secretly helped
       Mandrake

       Wolfsbane
       , and Mandrake's sister,
       Nettle

      Swordtail woke up in a haze of smoke, surrounded by many dragons. He was confused at first, the last thing that he remembered being him falling asleep in the jungle next to his friends. He then remembered how Blue was going to burn the "heart of salvation" to free the HiveWings, and looked around to try to find out what had happened. The smoke in the air suggested to him that there had been a large fire, larger than the pile of roots could have produced. He was still confused and stood up, but was in pain. His muscles and claws were bruised and sore. He then noticed that many of the dragons that surrounded him were HiveWings. He looked around, trying to find out where he was. He looked where the Poison Jungle was supposed to be and then began to remember being controlled by the othermind and burning the jungle. He then noticed Blue lying near him and attempted to walk over, but he was controlled and forced to stop.
Later, when the LeafWings and SilkWings arrived at
      Jerboa III
      's beach, Luna asked
      Snowfall
      if Swordtail and Blue were with them, then realized that Snowfall was not a SilkWing and asked Sundew the same. Sundew told her that they were not, but promised that that they would get them back, even "that slugs-for-brains Swordtail." Blue later mentions Swordtail in the vision of him, remembering how they escaped Cicada Hive not long ago.

   Although initially distrustful of her, Swordtail grew to find that he and Sundew shared many ideals, including the destruction of the HiveWing tribe. Swordtail agreed to follow Sundew once she revealed her plan to burn the Hives, sometimes referring to her as "the boss." Even when he has not entirely thought it out yet, he is quick to take her side, such as agreeing to destroy the Hives before Cricket reminds him of all the SilkWings that would perish. Sundew thinks he is slightly slow.
