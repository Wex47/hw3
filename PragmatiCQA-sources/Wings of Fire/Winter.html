   Winter is strong,
   loyal,
   cold, standoffish,
   determined,
   courageous,
   dignified,
   fierce,
   curious,
   sarcastic, arrogant,
   stubborn,
   tortured, heroic,
   irritable,
   sharp-minded, haughty,
   and grumpy.
   Nearly everything he says sounds sarcastic, but he is sometimes quite sincere.
   Later on in Winter's development, however, he becomes open-minded and reasonable.
   He speaks with commanding authority,
   and sometimes jokes awkwardly.
   He believes in the monarchy
   and has a brooding aristocratic way about him.
   When he is angry, he often acts explosively angry,
   self-righteous,
   and harsh
   before putting on an icy mask that hides his emotions.

  <p key="54ae8cc9-984f-4bc8-b03a-6a3ef279d931">
   When Winter was a young dragonet, he was very cautious.
   According to
   Hailstorm
   , he was very amusing and a lot more fun to tease than their sister
   Icicle
   . He tried excessively hard to place well in the Circle rankings and impress his family, but he often failed, and Hailstorm wished that Winter could relax.
   When Hailstorm was captured by the
   SkyWings
   , Winter blamed himself heavily and considered his decision to escape as cowardly.
   He once described his feelings as simultaneously furious, trapped, frustrated, grateful, safe, alone, on fire, wanting the wrong things, hating himself, and confused.
   He would like to learn more about what other tribes can do.

  <p key="aa5c01aa-b28f-402a-9899-afba6d907060">
   Moonwatcher
   described Winter's mind as very confusing.
   She mentioned that Winter is a better dragon than most;
   he is not the kind of dragon to betray someone's trust, and can think of what is best for

   instead of for just one tribe.
   She thinks he is honorable and brave
   - one of the truest, best dragons in Pyrrhia
   - but everything inside him is confusion and mirrors and pain.
   He is not the type of dragon to kill someone,
   and likes to know where he fits into the world.
   Even when many of Winter's actions and decisions throughout his time in Jade Mountain Academy are strictly against IceWing laws, Hailstorm described his brother as courageous and honorable,
   as he behaved with bravery and intelligence on his quest to rescue the lost IceWing warrior.
   He is serious,
   intelligent
   and noble.
  </p>
  <p key="df2326f1-2855-46d4-afea-09bc79d346bb">
   Even after seeing what the Pyrite enchantment did to Hailstorm, Winter was certain he would still be himself underneath.
   He does not want anyone to feel sorry for him.

After the guards lost interest in them, Kinkajou distracted the dragonets with a game of hide-and-seek while Winter made a hole in the hatchery's wall, from which they snuck out to find Icicle before a vengeful NightWing did. With her mind-reading, Moon sensed Icicle's presence in the nearby
       NightWing island
       . When she staggered from one of its tunnels, she looked ragged and tired with bloodshot eyes, still-bloody wounds, and vicious burn scars across the undersides of her wings. Icicle explained that she had kept herself awake with pain by lying beside the lava to avoid Scarlet's
       dreamvisits
       . Glory, led by Kinkajou's trail, shot Icicle with a tranquilizer dart; Winter crouched beside her and whispered that if Scarlet could provide proof that Hailstorm was still alive, then he would kill Glory himself. While Moon was listening to Icicle and Scarlet's conversation, she assured Winter that she was not worried about his "promise," as she trusted him; she also picked up a mountain range from the dream, which she drew on a scroll fetched by Kinkajou. They traveled to a valley located near an advanced scavenger village in search of the Talons of Peace, hoping that one of their SkyWings could identify the mountain range.

       tunnels
       , and concluded that she was secretly an
       animus
       dragon. Later that night, when everyone else was sleeping, Winter discussed his suspicions with Moon, but she disagreed; she had not seen any trace of magic in Pyrite's thoughts.

While they sleep that night, Winter was dreamvisited by Scarlet herself, who smugly told him about how she knew that Glory still lived and that Hailstorm was going to be dead by morning. Winter ripped his Skyfire pouch off and mentally shouted for Moon to wake him up. Moon heard him and rescued him from the dream. Since Scarlet was able to dreamvisit Winter, she must have seen him during the day when they were searching for her, proving that she was very near. Moon, Qibli, and Winter started searching for her while Kinkajou and Pyrite stayed behind. They located Scarlet, learning that Pyrite had something to do with Hailstorm. Before they go back to interrogate Pyrite, they see that
       Scarlet's companion
       is a NightWing. When they returned, they saw Kinkajou was injured by Scarlet's companion, who flew away blinded after Winter and Moon attacked him.

But there was one gigantic frozen dragon that they recognized as the frozen dragon they have to kill. Hailstorm unfroze it by tapping the ice covering it with his spear.

Winter went and told Hailstorm to kill her, letting himself lose. Hailstorm reluctantly did so, but Winter did not freeze like they thought he would.

      Hailstorm revealed that to win the Diamond Trial, he had to kill Winter, his own brother. Their parents secretly told Hailstorm that after he killed Foeslayer, he had to kill Winter with the spear and freeze him. Their parents did not tell Winter because they wanted Hailstorm to win, but Hailstorm did not want to kill Winter because he cared about him. So Winter told Hailstorm to let him escape without killing him, and when Hailstorm walks out of the cave alone, the IceWings would presume Winter dead. He also decided to betray his tribe by unfreezing Foeslayer and freeing her from her imprisonment, because he sympathized with her and Arctic's love, comparing it to his feelings for Moon. Winter decided, in the end, to stay loyal to his friends and flew back to Possibility with Foeslayer.

However, in the morning, they discovered that Moon fled with the scroll, and Winter was very worried about her setting him free by herself secretly. They found her crying about what happened to Darkstalker did to his father and she decided not to set Darkstalker free.

      After they got the scroll back from Moon, Qibli and Winter started to fight over which queen should get to keep it. Peril worried that they were fighting over the power of Darkstalker's scroll, and proceeded to burn it to ashes with her firescales so that no one could abuse the scroll's power and Darkstalker would never be freed. But because it was destroyed, Darkstalker's animus power returned to him instead and he used his magic to break out of the mountain from which he was buried under, which was one of the peaks near Jade Mountain.

      Winter was first shown flying above Darkstalker with Peril. As they begin talking to the massive dragon, he began to accuse Darkstalker of all the things he'd done to the IceWing tribe. Then, Darkstalker "did something" to him, causing him to stop the accusations. He began to say nice things to and about Darkstalker, making Winter's friends worried. Moon told Darkstalker not to enchant her friends using his animus powers, while Winter and Darkstalker reply at the same time that Darkstalker was not, although he most likely was enchanting Winter to like him.

       Later, Winter was seen outside of Jade Mountain with Moon, Peril, and Qibli. When Turtle confronted the dragonets, saying he did not trust Darkstalker, Winter said that Turtle needed to just spend more time with Darkstalker, still obviously enchanted. Beside him, Qibli jokingly stated that he would agree, and would trust Darkstalker if it was not Winter who was saying nice things about the 2,000-year-old NightWing. Winter left soon after.

Qibli asked what Darkstalker did, and Turtle tells them both what he did. Qibli said that he wondered why he was doing that, and Winter said he was just trying to make friends and be kind. They had a little argument, part of it being about Winter being enchanted. Winter said Darkstalker saving

       When they reached Vulture's headquarters, Qibli told Winter to let him do the talking. Winter replied, "That is how conversations with you usually work." They continued until Winter sees two scavengers running around in a maze, and inhaled sharply, which alerted Vulture. Winter demanded to know what Vulture is going to do to them and defended the scavengers when Vulture said that he was going to eat the loser and that they were no smarter than mice. Qibli then hushed Winter, and Vulture began ranting about how it was, "perfectly normal to feel like your pet must think the way you do." Winter then offered to buy the scavengers, which Vulture replied to with a query as to how he would do that, with Winter being assumed dead by his family. This shocked both Winter and Qibli because they had not said anything about Winter being a royal or him being assumed dead.

      In the epilogue, Kinkajou found Winter trying to catch scavengers for a scavenger sanctuary in Sanctuary, the town the Talons of Peace was building. Winter asked Kinkajou if she came alone, indirectly asking if she was with Moon. The epilogue revealed that Winter had the option of staying at Jade Mountain Academy.

   Hailstorm is Winter's elder brother. He viewed Winter as amusing and fun to tease,
    but after Hailstorm was captured by the SkyWings, Winter blamed himself heavily,
    and there was an old familiar guilt surrounding his brother.
    Winter thought that even if he returned to the Ice Kingdom and was placed at the bottom of the Seventh circle for deserting Jade Mountain Academy, it would have been worthwhile if Hailstorm could have returned home.
    Hailstorm's disappearance also hurt Winter very much each time he thought it happened.
    Winter was able to push aside the Circle rankings and the opinions of Glacier, Narwhal, and Tundra in favor of doing whatever was necessary to rescue his brother.
    Hailstorm thinks Winter is courageous and honorable,
    and when Hailstorm was attacked by Foeslayer during the Diamond Trial, Winter rushed to save his brother's life without a second thought, though he could have won the Trial;
    he cares more about Hailstorm's life than the rankings.
    Before Hailstorm's capture, he and Winter would often go hunting together, and it is one of the things Winter missed most while his brother was imprisoned.

He truly believes that if he can find her, he can stop her, and they can find another way to get Hailstorm back together. When he discovers that she killed an innocent NightWing

However, after the NightWing is uncovered he realizes there is no going back for Icicle. When he finally finds her in the old NightWing city he is shocked by what he sees. His normally perfectly pristine sister had been forcefully keeping herself awake by scratching herself and burning her wings
    with the lava to avoid talking to Scarlet. Winter attempts to reach out to her, but she continues to shy away and insult him. Then Icicle gets hit by a sleep dart, and desperately claws at her brother, telling him to keep her awake. Winter tells her to let Scarlet come, then lies to her, telling her he will kill Glory for her in order to appease his sister, and buy them some time. Winter continues to watch after his sister's unconscious form, refusing to leave her side. Then Moon discovers a clue as to Scarlet's location in Icicle's dream, and Winter decides to leave and track down Scarlet, and hopefully their brother. He is still shown to be worried about his sister, later asking Glacier about Icicle's fate.

    After realizing that Narwhal had intended for him to die during the Diamond Trial, he felt hurt in a deep place where he had thought his family could not hurt him anymore.

    Moonwatcher

  </h3>
  <p key="75b29d30-6b86-4fce-8130-b8d1dcf624b9">
   Moonwatcher is one of Winter's closest friends, and Winter is in love with her.
    Moonwatcher once stated that she would never be Winter's enemy, no matter what he said.
    She wanted Winter to come with her to solve the Jade Mountain Prophecy, and her face crumbled into disappointment when he refused.
    Since Winter began wearing skyfire, it is a lot easier for Moonwatcher to talk to him.
    Winter sometimes jokes with Moonwatcher,
    but he feels a twisting feeling in his chest when he thinks about her,
    and hearing her say his name was described to be like a spell that runs warmth through his bones.
    Winter had never met anyone who seemed to be as interested in scavengers as he was until he met Moonwatcher.
    She is determined to support Winter whether he wants her help or not,
    and Winter has had quiet thoughts about how Moonwatcher is different from the other NightWings, and perhaps different than most dragons in Pyrrhia.
    His expression while looking at her once was soulful and full of tortured longing.
    He quite likes her,
    and misses her dearly after moving to Sanctuary.
  </p>
  <p key="cbb9111b-1961-4822-8c59-edb258412284">
   Winter once thought that where Narwhal and Tundra saw Winter as nothing more than a gray lump of ice, Moonwatcher saw dazzling mountain peaks,
    and she regards him as one of the best dragons in Pyrrhia.
    Moonwatcher finds Winter's mind to be very confusing,
    but Moonwatcher regards Winter as someone who can think bigger than the things that affect him personally.
    She trusts Winter
    and thinks that he is honorable and brave,
    and Winter felt a rush of gratitude for her understanding of how important rescuing Hailstorm was to him.
    Winter often cannot tell when Moonwatcher is joking,
    but he looks at her in a loving way,
    and felt hollowed out when he pictured her and Qibli together.
    He was afraid of what he might say to her alone in the dark.
    Winter's heart told him to rescue Moonwatcher when their group was attacked by Shapeshifter,
    and while he initially felt guilty about being Moonwatcher's friend under the judgement of Hailstorm, he felt a second wave of guilt after realizing how much Moonwatcher had done to help him.
    After Narwhal and Tundra intended for Winter to die during the Diamond Trial, he thought that Moonwatcher would never have done something like that to him,
    and he becomes his best self around her.
  </p>
  <p key="917732f4-836e-4c56-bfab-1c9e20b9c033">
   However, Winter acted harshly
    and explosively angry and caused Moonwatcher to flare up during their argument about Darkstalker;
    Qibli wondered how he could yell at Moonwatcher the way he did, if he truly loved her,
    and Kinkajou admitted that he had been mean towards her when he yelled at her or did not believe in her.
    When Moonwatcher chose Qibli over Winter, he was heartbroken and wondered how long it would take his heart to heal.

   Qibli is one of Winter's closest friends. Winter was disgruntled to find he agreed with Qibli on something,
    and he often pretends like he hates Qibli,
    but Qibli likes the fact that Winter would try to save anyone,
    and thinks Winter is honorable.
    Winter saved his life from a flaming scavenger spear,
    and Qibli was sincere and genuine in his thanks.
    Qibli is also sometimes affectionately exasperated with him,
    and he once joked that he was nearly sure he would rather have Winter around than Pyrite.
    When Winter was in the Ice Kingdom, imagining what Qibli would say in response to Tundra made him laugh for the first time since he had returned home.
    After realizing that Narwhal and Tundra had intended for Winter to die during the Diamond Trial, he thought that Qibli would not do something like that to him.
    Winter is often irritated by Qibli's observant tendencies,
    but he knows Qibli well enough to see when he is deliberately trying to annoy someone,
    and he looked to Winter to decide whether or not to reveal valuable information about Scarlet.
    When Winter initially failed to find Hailstorm, he felt despair and hopelessness, but Qibli fiercely told Winter that he was not allowed to stop searching until Hailstorm was found.
    In addition, Qibli made sure to pair Moonwatcher and Winter together during their search in hopes that Winter find solace in her, even though Qibli was also in love with Moonwatcher.
    After Winter told Moonwatcher and Qibli that he should have nothing to do with them or the prophecy, Qibli sounded genuinely angry.
    Winter felt hollowed out when he pictured Moonwatcher and Qibli together.
    Despite this, Qibli has helped Winter become less serious, and had an irrepressible grin on his face when speaking to Winter in Sanctuary. Qibli considers him a best friend and is affectionate
    and genuinely delighted towards him.
    Winter misses him after moving to Sanctuary,
    and he is teasing towards his friend.

    but when Snowfall felt the Gift of Vision making her faint again, Winter helped her without argument or question or bewilderment.
    During Snowfall's reign as queen, Winter used the proper practices for her
    but stopped at Snowfall's request.
    A small part of her wants him to be happy.

   Tundra is Winter's mother. After Winter dropped into the Fifth Circle due to a failed polar bear hunt,
    Tundra made him memorize long sagas for months about dragons who had attempted the Diamond Trial, including about a hundred verses speculating how gruesomely they may have died.
    Tundra made it clear that no dragonet of hers would reach their seventh hatching day any lower than the Second Circle, even if it meant risking their life for the Diamond Trial.
    Winter speculated that his mother sees him as nothing more than a lump of gray ice.
    For a month after Hailstorm's death report, Tundra did not speak to Winter.
    He felt elation and pride when Tundra thanked Winter for rescuing Hailstorm, but she then added that it was the least that Winter could do.
    After realizing that Tundra had intended for him to die during the Diamond Trial, he felt hurt in a deep place where he had thought his family could not hurt him anymore.
    Winter suspected that Tundra would have wanted Winter to complete a necessary task in any way possible, even if it was immoral.
    She is sharp and demanding towards Winter,
    and does not want to see him as of
