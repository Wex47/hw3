   IceWing scales can range from silvery-gray and white colors to pale shades of blue, purple, and pink, intended to blend into their icy surroundings. Their coloring has been described as "silver like the moons," "pale blue like ice," "as pale as the moons," or "moon-white scales," and "scales the color of sky reflected in the snow on the distant mountain peaks." IceWings have dark blue or stormy gray eyes, forked blue tongues, and dark blue blood.

   The head of an IceWing is shaped like a diamond and is very narrow, with a ruff of extra horns behind their heads and spikes along their backs. They are lean dragons with thin, whip-like tails with icicle-shaped spines, ending in a very sharp tip.
   They have serrated claws for walking on ice. Some IceWings, such as

  <p key="adf51f25-1fcc-4c75-ac8f-8ab9ff02a669">
   When upset, some IceWings have been shown to ruffle up the spines around their necks.

   IceWings prefer to eat creatures who live in the Ice Kingdom, such as polar bears, whales, seals, penguins, walruses, hawks, and fish. IceWing meals have been described as containing "bowls of dripping meat."
   They also consume scavengers, though not very often, as they are rare in the Ice Kingdom. IceWings are known to consume fish as well due to their presence in the ocean waters. Seals are common among the lower classes due to the gift of sustenance, a hole in the ice where the lower-born IceWings live, enchanted to always give the hunter a seal when they stick a talon in. IceWings would also eat frozen berries, and even have ice cream.
   IceWings typically enjoy their food raw.

   IceWings can withstand subzero temperatures and very bright light.
   They have serrated claws for gripping slippery ice, which was described as "ten times sharper than normal claws" and "like getting clawed four times with each claw instead of once" when used offensively.
   They are also known for having sharper eyesight than the other Pyrrhian dragon tribes.
   Their scales emit an icy-cold chill,
   which can freeze tiny drops of water on their bodies.
   They can also exhale a freezing weapon called frostbreath, also known as "freezing death breath" by the dragonets of destiny.

  <p key="3d076339-2aae-4a66-a2a7-07e4a8caaacd">
   Frostbreath appears as a cloud of sparkling smoke,
   and can cause limbs to fall clean off from frostbite.
   The only known direct cure is the gift of healing, a set of narwhal horns enchanted by Queen

   It forms ice crystals where it makes contact with dirt,

   An IceWing can be prevented from using their frostbreath for a short time by raising their body temperature either via a warm environment or manually heating them up (hot metal, fire, etc.), similar to

   's scales have been seen "melting" while in the arena, which could indicate that IceWings' scales cannot withstand the heat.
   A dragon affected by frostbreath will first feel freezing pain, shocking the affected area into paralysis, and is quite painful for the first few seconds until the area becomes numb. Victims of frostbreath will sometimes become unconscious,
   which can be treated with water and hot coals.

  <p key="cde82386-1b03-4b6d-b31c-a3cff0066729">
   A fire-breathing dragon could survive having frostbreath shot down their throat for a short time, but the only known way to survive after sustaining internal frostbreath injuries is by staying immersed in lava.
   Internal frostbreath injuries can eventually overwhelm a dragon if they leave their lava.

   IceWings have trouble scenting things properly in more crowded environments like forests or towns.

   IceWings were once known for having more animus dragons than any other tribe, as well as having magic the longest.
   These dragons were carefully bred into the royal family and monitored extremely cautiously, with strict rules for the use of their powers to keep their soul from turning evil. IceWing animus dragons were only permitted to use their power once,
   for the benefit of the tribe, at the gifting ceremony on their seventh hatching day.
   Some animus IceWings went against the rules, such as Queen Diamond who used her power three times — once for her normal animus gift, the gift of healing, once for the gift of vengeance (the Diamond Caves), and once to enchant the IceWing crown to make the wearer hate NightWings as much as she had. IceWings host a test similar to the

The shackles that bound her were enchanted to refreeze her and revive her each time she was killed. The only way to remove the shackles was to breathe frostbreath on them (Queen Diamond added this to the enchantment in case the IceWing tribe needed Foeslayer as a bargaining chip, but thought that no IceWing would ever even think of freeing her).

   IceWings appear to be fairly sophisticated, strict, and superior in comparison to the other tribes, being the only Pyrrhian dragons to have a hierarchy. IceWings are very prideful, and often perceived as rude and arrogant by dragons of other tribes.
   There are strict IceWing codes of behavior: most IceWings agree that the only way to make dragonets strong is to expose all of their weaknesses, and that shame and fear are powerful weapons in teaching. If everyone is disappointed in a dragonet, the consensus is that they will work harder to prove themselves.
   Most dragonets are seasoned warriors in the Ice Kingdom.

   Royal IceWings are typically not affectionate, as Winter mentioned that hugging their family members would be considered undignified.
   The lines of guards that attend the IceWing queen are perfectly coiled,
   and IceWings are noble to their queen's orders.
   It is painful to hold the IceWing guard stance for too long,
   but Winter practiced for hours to get the pose perfectly right: his wings folded exactly so, his tail in the right position, his snout up and shoulders back.

   The aristocracy and nobility of the IceWing tribe is divided into seven ranks of status, known as Circles. The First Circle is the top, or best, while the Seventh Circle is the worst. IceWings below the age of seven are ranked as dragonets and graduate to the adult rankings on their seventh hatching day.
   A dragonet's ranking on their seventh hatching day determines the course of the rest of their life, and if a dragonet reaches their seventh hatching day in the Seventh Circle, they are stationed to an arctic outpost for the rest of their life.
   In the Ice Kingdom, IceWing parents with the highest rank choose the names for their dragonets, regardless of gender, and are then approved by the queen.

  <p key="68487c19-c415-48ad-8ed1-9a3c62edcabe">

  </p>
  <p key="dbe8dea2-b2b1-4619-916c-762fcd9919d0">
   IceWing dragonets raise their ranking through hunting, training, performing traditional IceWing customs, and passing tests given by their guardians.
   In the dragonet rankings, each hunt is still a chance to prove themselves and increase their rank.
   The highest-ranked dragonets are more respected. When a dragonet reaches their seventh hatching day in the First or Second Circle, they will be housed in the queen's palace and allowed to provide input on important matters. When an adult loses this rank, they can lose their place in the palace.
   If IceWings die or are exiled, their names are slashed through on the gift of order, as shown in

Foeslayer turns back to ice when killed, leaving the two dragonets to fight to the death. Only one of the dragonets is given information about the dangerous trial.
