   The Summer Palace was well
   hidden by a thick canopy of trees.
  </p>
  <p key="1c65841a-e170-4116-a38d-c425122b5d0a">
   The entrance of the palace was located within an island shaped like a giant dragon skeleton with gaps and holes throughout the pale stone. The stone skeleton's nose pointed towards another island ringed with forbidding rocks and a high, sheer cliff face on all sides. The top was a rioting jungle, with thick green vines and leaves pressed so close together that there was no clear spot through. Between two spiraling rocks, sharp and evenly matched like dragon horns, there was an underwater entrance
   leading to a dark
   tunnel.
   It was covered by a curtain of long, sun-colored tendrils of kelp
   and contained at least ten
   small, above-ground caverns.
  </p>
  <p key="7255714f-b0d6-4f84-965b-e088076f2aea">
   The tunnel led into an open lake and sea
   -green-tinted sunlight.
   The inside of the island was surrounded by towering cliffs on all sides, and the green canopy was located far above the lake, woven so thickly it looked like a jungle from above. Waterfalls cascaded down from several holes in the cliffs, bursting into spray as they hit the lake. Four pillars of blue-tinted white stone spiraled out of the water, winding towards one another until they formed a towering pavilion in the middle of the lake. The pavilion had twelve circular levels, each smaller than the one below. There were few walls, most of them very low,
   and the entire structure was latticed with curving spaces and holes and small wading pools. There were ledges within the cliffs, and the only sounds were the splashing of the waterfalls, the soft hush of dragons breathing, and the quiet lapping of waves on beaches around the lake.
   There were several cave openings and rocks that jutted out of the water.
   The largest waterfall was located nearly as high as the leaf canopy and divided around boulders.
   Up close, the leaf canopy contained small blue flowers.
  </p>
  <p key="3a45b6cd-2a1b-49d5-9cdd-c8de5b54cee9">
   The lake beach was composed of white pebbles and faced a tall cave opening lined with sand.
   The caves dotting the cliffs were used as guest rooms, and one, used by

   , was lined with extra sand. Each level had a different purpose, such as dragonet school visits, celebration spectacles,
   Council
   meetings, and war planning.
   The lowest levels were clustered with several guards
   resting, eating, and playing games.
   They contained a table with a niche containing a pair of heavy silver keys.

   to design small corners of the palace as well as the blueprint of the SeaWing throne on the top level of the pavilion.
   It was built upon a large island rising from the ocean floor; all around the island, gray boulders and tall spires of rock jutted out of the water. A wavering forest of sticky, orange-yellow kelp guarded a dark underwater tunnel in the cliff, which lead to a wide-open lake that was located in the heart of the island, surrounded on all sides by craggy, soaring cliffs
   that formed a circle over the lake.
   The center of this lake was the birthplace of the Summer Palace; described as a vast, strange shape growing out of the water, it looked as if someone had taken four towering pillars of white stone and braided them together. Huge, flat bubbles of stone grew out of the pillars at regular intervals, and it slowly, constantly grew. It was an amorphous, misshapen blob, a strange growth within the interior of the beautiful island.
   The lakeshore was covered in pebbles,
   with greenery
   , shrubbery, and foliage
   growing around the top of the cavern, which would later become a full canopy that obscured the palace from view.
   The temperature inside the island was cool.
   It took nearly ten years to reach its final form.

   After its destruction, the Summer Palace was reduced to smoking foliage,
   charred ruins, and corpses.

   Council meetings were held on a level halfway up the structure in the center of the lake. Twelve dragon-sized pools were arranged in a circle with small channels running from one to the next, criscrossing the center. Glittering emeralds the size of fish eggs, embedded in the stone, spelled out words by each pool, including DRAGON HEALTH,
   AQUACULTURE, WAR, HUNTING, MAGIC &amp; PUBLISHING, COMMUNICATION,
   TREASURY, DEFENSE, and SECRETS &amp; SPIES.
   The largest pool is labeled QUEEN, and a pool entitled DRAGONET CARE is located two pools away. The wet stone is chilly.

   Queen Coral's chambers were located in a vast underwater cave below one of the waterfalls, lined with waving tendrils of forest green and brilliant golden anemones. Stone carvings of dolphins danced around the entrance, and the walls were studded with emeralds and pearls. The beds were soft expanses of bubbly seaweed, and the sound of the waterfall splashing overhead can be heard.
   Where the waterfall met the lake, just behind the cascade and right outside the cave entrance, there was a small pocket of air.

The other end of this level held a long gray stone table with a scroll spread out onto it, held down at either end by small seahorses: heavy, intricately detailed, carved from dark wood, and containing dragonlike expressions on their tiny faces.
   The top corner of the table contained a small pool of black ink.

   The prison cave was high up on the cliff wall, not far from the canopy, overlooking the pavilion below. It glowed with a strange blue light, and crackling sounds could be heard from inside. The hard
   stone floor was damp and the light was dim, and a path wound into a huge cavern.
   The cages had no bars or doors; instead, a channel of water as wide as two dragons encircled each prisoner, trapping them on islands of stone that varied in size. Water poured from grooves in the ceiling down to the channels, creating cascading walls along all of the islands. The water and moats all glowed the same bright blue and gave off the same fizzing, crackling sound, and the pathway wound around and between the islands like a long bridge. The ceiling was covered in glowworms, casting the prison in an eerie light, and iridescent purple jellyfish added to the dim lighting.
   The freezing
   water was controlled by a chain hanging along the wall; when pulled, the mechanisms within the stone clanked and groaned, opening a small doorway in the underwater wall of the moat and releasing electric eels into the water.
