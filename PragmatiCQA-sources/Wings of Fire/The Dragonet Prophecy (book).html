However, he does this during a training battle with the infamously grumpy Kestrel. The SkyWing taunts him and pins him down. Before she can do any more harm to him, the

   , the NightWing who wrote the prophecy. Clay and Tsunami, the only two able to stay in the underground river for extended periods due to their tribes' natural abilities, overheard this information by sneaking closer through the underwater lake. Morrowseer arrives the following day, and as he inspects them, he angrily calls out Glory for not being a SkyWing, deeming her unworthy. He attacks Tsunami for her impudence, and Clay and Sunny leap into action to help her, prompting him to see them as acceptable. Both Glory and Starflight stay idle during the fight. However, Morrowseer calls Starflight to have a private audience. The two left, and the guardians turn on Tsunami, angrily yelling at her. After Starflight returns, Clay speaks to him, noting his reluctance. Clay then overhears Sunny's yell and he sees Tsunami being chained. After Morrowseer and the guardians exit the cavern, she tells him to spy on the guardians. He overhears their plot to kill Glory to appease Morrowseer. After much thought, the group frantically decides to send Clay down the underground river to escape to the outside and return to free them by unlocking the cave entrance. Acting on advice from Starflight, he manages to get into a cavern full of glowworms, which he, for a moment, mistook for stars. He heard roaring

When Clay tries to follow the stream, he comes into contact with a white substance that starts to poison and dissolve his scales. He hits something and is knocked unconscious but is later roused by Tsunami, who managed to get free and heard his screams, cleansing him of the substance. Tsunami remarks to him when he asks her how she escaped the chains that Sunny and Starflight melted them. Then, the duo cascade over a waterfall. Clay notices Tsunami's inability to fly from her dislocated wing due to her escape from the chains, and he saves her from falling to her death. He then has his first experience with mud, realizing its healing qualities to him, and he relocates Tsunami's wing. The pair then encounter

Then, with a nod from Clay, Tsunami impales Scarlet's tail with the scavenger's sword to the ground to escape, and they flee towards the peaks. Afterward, they see the smoke signal from the other dragonets to locate the caverns they were trapped in and go to rescue them. However, the signal also attracts Scarlet, and the entire group (except

In the end, Horizon throws himself onto Peril for a quick death.

After much resentment, Peril agrees. In the morning, guards escort him, Tsunami, and Starflight to Scarlet's throne room, and she asks which one of them could fight against an IceWing. Clay denounces Tsunami and Starflight, so Queen Scarlet puts him in the arena to fight. He is pitted against an IceWing named

However, Osprey tells the real story. In reality, Kestrel was a loyal soldier and was ordered to join the breeding program, yielding an egg with two dragonets inside. One, Peril, had taken all the fire from the other, Sky. As SkyWing custom, Kestrel was ordered to kill both and leave the breeding program for the remainder of her life. Kestrel had tried to escape with the two dragonets only to be caught by Scarlet at the

   . Scarlet explains that Kestrel had a chance to live if she killed one of her dragonets. Kestrel chose the male dragonet to kill and did it with her claws, but Queen Scarlet changed her mind. Kestrel tried to escape with Peril but was burned by touch and was forced to flee without her. Clay realizes this is the cause of Kestrel's burn scars on her palms.

   Peril launches herself into the arena, defending Kestrel with the

   , a tradition that allows her to stand in for the prisoner by fighting a combatant in the arena. Scarlet figured out that Osprey's words had educated Peril of the Champion's Shield since Peril cannot hold

   . Scarlet, angered, picks Osprey up and dropped him from the sky. Since he cannot fly due to his broken wing, he dies. Peril attempts to save him but realizes she cannot save him due to her firescales burning him. After Osprey's death, Scarlet dismisses Peril. That night, Burn arrives to collect Sunny (for her collection of weird dragons and objects) and celebrate Scarlet's hatching day. In a futile attempt to communicate with Peril, Clay uses a wire she burned through to start playing a song:
   The Dragonets' Song
   . Soon, all the prisoners in the arena begin to sing and play. Scarlet, angered, takes him, Tsunami, and Starflight into Peril's room and makes Peril leave the room. Scarlet places rocks that burn in the entrance to assure they will not escape. Then, Starflight notices Peril and uses her to escape the room. On the way out, they notice Sunny over the main hall. However, Peril betrays them. Clay accidentally touches Peril, thus figuring out he is immune to fire. The SkyWing queen takes them back, and Starflight explains Clay's immunity.

   , and pins him down, explaining that she won without killing him. Queen Scarlet mocks her, saying that she is too scared of fighting and war, and Tsunami snaps Gill's neck in retaliation. Starflight is next to fight against Tsunami, but the two refuse to fight. Then, they are forced to face scavengers. Two of the four were killed, and they are told to face IceWings. At that moment, Morrowseer arrives with NightWing soldiers, killing the IceWings, and then saves only Starflight. Scarlet, enraged, finally places Clay against Peril. Caught off guard by Clay's immunity, she is pinned. Scarlet shouts, "Use your venom! That was thrilling, and I didn't even get to see it last time!" Then, Glory rears up, breaks free of the tree, and spits venom at Burn, who shoves Scarlet in front of her. The venom hits Scarlet's face, and all the dragons at the arena flee in terror.

When Kestrel is rescued, they proceed to rescue her, and Kestrel informs them of where their eggs were taken from. Then, after Kestrel flies off, Clay, Tsunami, Glory, and Sunny decide to swim towards the

Kestrel asks what they are talking about, as she cannot hear them over the howling wind. They do not reply, and Blister then questions Kestrel's attendance. Kestrel responds that Morrowseer said the dragonets were in danger. He then implies that it was a plot to get her to come to the island and then states that she has failed him. Kestrel attempts to argue, saying that she worked for the Talons of Peace and not Morrowseer. However, she is soon killed by Blister and pushed over the cliffside. After discarding Kestrel, Morrowseer informs Blister to eliminate Webs. The book ends when Blister commands Morrowseer to find the dragonets and bring them to her, saying that they will both get what they want if he does.
