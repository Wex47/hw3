   She also felt guilty after becoming defensive so quickly around Riptide.
   She believes that helping others is important,

      During their imprisonment above the SkyWing arena, she proved to be very temperamental and would lash out at the SkyWing guards, particularly with her strong tail. Due to this, Tsunami was given extra chains to protect the guards. After Clay denounced her as "just one more SeaWing" in front of Scarlet to protect her from the arena, he was forced to fight an

Then she was forced to fight Starflight, and to Scarlet's furious disapproval, they just proceeded to embrace each other gently. She and Starflight were then pitted against four scavengers, then some IceWings, only to be interrupted by Morrowseer, who saved Starflight after killing all of the IceWing prisoners.

Coral then woke up and invited them to come with her to the pavilion to eat with the Council. Tsunami accidentally embarrassed herself by eating when the queen has not given permission.

       Whirlpool found Tsunami and started her first lesson of Aquatic by making her recite a scroll, called The Tragedy Of Orca, written by her mother, Coral. Frustrated, Tsunami stormed off, as she did not learn anything due to the flashes she copied from him completely out of her comprehension and her not knowing anything from the actual scroll. She searched and found for Riptide, who then taught her a few basics of Aquatic, including "I will protect," a phrase she used multiple times later.

Tsunami discovered that Anemone was an animus, which runs in the royal family. Disobeying Whirlpool, Anemone refused to demonstrate her powers to Blister at first but eventually gave in. Blister noticed Webs spying on them in the canopy and threw him onto Tsunami. Coral recognized him as the one who stole Tsunami's egg and refused his plea for mercy. Shortly afterward, she slammed her tail into his head and left him to fall. Tsunami saved him with the help of Clay. She realized later that Webs had saved her from

       Tsunami decided to wait in the Royal Hatchery for the egg to hatch. However, since she was also an heir, Orca's statue came alive and attacked her. Tsunami used a
       spear
       to stab the statue through the mouth and pin it into the ground. She went to grab the egg, and when she got it, it hatched a small green dragonet who was soon named Auklet. She kicked open the door, and the statue went inactive, as it was enchanted only to kill when there was no one to see it. She found out that the statue was enchanted by her sister, Orca, secretly an animus. She then alerted her mother, who had the statue destroyed.
      </p>
      Blister encouraged the dragonets to choose her, but the dragonets refused to do so until they got the entire picture. Blister convinced Coral to throw them in her prison. Anemone arrived in the prison and used her animus magic to find out that Whirlpool was the one who had attacked Tsunami. Whirlpool revealed that he planned to kill Tsunami and marry Anemone, but since Blister planned to use her animus powers to win the war, she probably would not survive, and he said that he had changed his mind to choose Auklet. Anemone used a spear to hit Whirlpool, who then fell into the electric eel moat. The eels then promptly shocked and killed him. Tsunami and her friends used this opportunity to jump through the waterfall and escape. They escaped just in time to see the SkyWings and

When Tsunami sees Turtle, she expresses her surprise and joy while Sunny tells her to calm down. Later, Anemone mentions Tsunami's name when she lists the dragons whom she thought were a threat to her to-be throne.

She was mentioned in the NightWing Palace dungeons where Qibli and

Foeslayer said that she had intercepted the SeaWing dragonet on her way to the rainforest and also mentioned that Tsunami had been a bit 'shouty.' In the epilogue, she is mentioned to have been rescued and is back at Jade Mountain.

      tells Tsunami that she was a great queen, and that nobody invited her to come to the Ice Kingdom to insult Snowfall. When Hazel asks Tsunami to lead them elsewhere, she suggests going to Jerboa's hut, where Moon and Luna were, and shoots Snowfall a disgusted look while saying that Thorn would have known "how to treat a group of harmless, tired, sad dragons." Tsunami is then mentioned to have gone back out to sea to retrieve their makeshift rafts, along with Lynx and a few other dragons. Upon arriving at Sanctuary, Riptide cries out Tsunami's name and lights up with joy, to which Snowfall thought made no sense because Tsunami was "the very absolute most annoying member of the dragonet prophecy." Tsunami then tells Riptide that there were new dragons for Sanctuary, to his surprise. Later, when all the queens arrive at Sanctuary, Tsunami stands up to silence the council, then proceeded to recount what had happened previously with Luna and her journey. When electing a dragon from each tribe to go on the journey from Pyrrhia to Pantala, Tsunami volunteers herself to be the SeaWing representative. Near the end of the book, it is said that the team had left for Pantala.

   Coral is Tsunami's mother. While Tsunami mostly adores her mother, she often questions Coral's ruling and judgment. Tsunami believes that some of the queen's ways are scary and harsh, such as slaughtering her guards brutally and publicly to punish them. But overall, it is shown that they love each other and Queen Coral cares for her very much.

   Riptide is supportive of Tsunami,

    Riptide's whole face lit up when Tsunami was mentioned, and Moonwatcher said that Tsunami thinks of Riptide all the time, and wants to hear from him.
    She makes him nervous,
    but she genuinely likes him,
    and hoped to see him again after their initial meeting.
    She likes having him around her,
    and although her first instinct was to yell at him for lying about the identity of his father,
    he looks at her without any expectation of her becoming queen or any judgement about her murder of Gill; he only sees her as a dragon whom he likes very much.
    After she reassured him physically, Tsunami felt something tingle in the air between them.
    He helped her to forget about Gill's death for a while, and he took her front talons in his before they parted. He told her to be careful and that he would be close, if she needed him.
    Tsunami considered him to be someone that she could trust,
    but after discovering that he had lied to her about his affiliation with the Talons of Peace, her trust was broken in him, and she wondered if she could believe anything he said.
    After he apologized to her, she was unsure about her forgiveness towards her, but she still wanted a chance to decide. She wanted him to survive the War of SandWing Succession, and she wanted to meet him again after it was over.
    Tsunami and Riptide are currently in a long-distance relationship.
