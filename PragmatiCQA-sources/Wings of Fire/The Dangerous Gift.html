   kingdom
   , the young queen is forced to reconsider her plan. Maybe she can only keep her tribe safe … if she's willing to risk everything.

   Snowfall hears about a group of dragons flying towards her kingdom. She demands the scout who reported the sighting to her if he is sure that it is not
   NightWings
   and he responds that no black dragons have been spotted. She ponders about numerous possibilities, such as if
   Darkstalker
   is not gone after all and if it is a group of
   RainWings
   flying towards them. After telling the scout to look again,
   Tundra
   shows up and informs Snowfall that it is time to rearrange the names on the gift of order. Snowfall thinks about her experiences of being queen and, after what she lost in order to get it, finds it to be her least favorite thing in the world. She mentions how she thought the gift of order was a good thing for the kingdom, but she realized that it is more an act of twisted revenge rather than a gift at all and hates how she has to move names every single night. Snowfall puts on her crown and moves a couple names around, such as
   Hailstorm
   and
   Permafrost
   . Tundra questions how little she reordered the names and Snowfall orders her to go away, wanting to move on to dealing with the mysterious dragons as soon as possible. She remembers how Tundra and
   Narwhal
   used to be second-in-command to
   Glacier
   and that Tundra hates having to bow to her niece. Snowfall then hears a noise in the courtyard and realizes that someone is watching her.

   She orders the dragon to show themselves, preparing to use her frostbreath on them. Lynx appears from the tree of light and Snowfall asks if she was spying on her, being surprised when Lynx jokingly confirms that she was. Lynx says that she is worried about her and mentions how the only dragons Snowfall talks to nowadays are "old, bossy, and kind of mean." Snowfall brags about how she has been prepared for being queen her whole life and Lynx says that she did not expect her to be queen for at least a couple decades. A flashback is then shown with then-queen Glacier on her deathbed as a result of the
   plague
   , with Snowfall,
   Crystal
   , and
   Mink
   beside her. Glacier stresses how she does not want a succession war like the
   SandWings
   have and makes her daughters promise to not challenge each other for the throne and to support whoever she chooses to be queen. After all three of them do so, she names Snowfall as the next queen. Crystal leaves the kingdom the next morning afterwards, leaving Snowfall to wonder if she is plotting against her. Lynx suggests that Snowfall should take a break and she rejects it, yelling that her sister is going into hiding to kill her and the "evil" mysterious dragons will likely arrive by tomorrow, and ponders if Crystal and the mystery dragons are working together, or if queens

   , but Snowfall continues to be paranoid. She then tells Lynx that the unidentified dragons are coming from the western ocean and Lynx realizes that they might be from the lost continent. She proposes a plan to Snowfall: they will fly to the coast to meet them and find out who they are and what they intend to do. Snowfall reluctantly agrees and decides to head to the Forbidden Treasury to see if any animus gifts can help her.

   She sees Mink chatting with some of her guards as she was walking towards the vault. She gives Snowfall a gift, a mink carved from a tiny block of ice, and asks if she can come into the royal chambers, stuttering that she slept with her mother when she had trouble sleeping. Agreeing to her request, Snowfall stresses to the guards that nobody is allowed in the room for tonight and pushes her bed aside, revealing a hole underneath it, leading to the vault. She tells Mink to never tell anybody else about it and they look around the area. Snowfall spots a small tiara, the gift of strength, and takes it, wearing it on her head. Refusing the gift of compromise when she sees it, she spots an opal ring on one of the alcoves, the carved words saying that it is the gift of vision. Assuming that it would improve her eyesight, she slips the ring onto her talon. Passing by a piece of the gift of understanding, Snowfall sees a set of pale silver wristbands with diamonds and is certain that it will give the invading dragons an unwelcome surprise upon reading the inscription.

  <p key="9d3ae978-fe22-44af-b11c-01606de2ac65">
   She sets off towards the coast at dawn, accompanied by Lynx and five guards. Lynx wonders if Snowfall got any sleep and she admits that she did not, lying that she was busy with both the treasury and trying in vain to have Mink not sleep in her bed. She reveals that her items are animus-touched, causing Lynx to remind her that the Forbidden Treasury is named that way for a reason, which Snowfall ignores. Asking the queen if she can understand and control the items she is wearing, Snowfall assures her that she can, leaving out that the gift of vision is not working the way she assumed. Snowfall then shows Lynx the weapons she has on her, leaving out some of the other hidden weapons on her in case Lynx was working against her, and asks her about one of the outer villages. Lynx mentions that her estate overlooks Among-The-Evergreens and how she has not been back there in a while when one of the guards spots the mystery dragons up ahead. When Snowfall sees them, she starts to panic and says that they are going to kill her, but Lynx manages to calm her down. The group flies to a cliff and watch the mysterious dragons land on the beach below them. Snowfall recalls the
   Battle of Jade Mountain
   and how she learned from the empathy spell that the IceWings doubted her ability to rule, and that the NightWings do not believe that she is a serious threat, remembering it as the worst day of her life. Snowfall and her guards approach the exhausted refugees and Queen
   Hazel
   introduces herself and the two tribes, pleading for help, but Snowfall refuses and orders them to leave her kingdom. She hears a scream and pulls her knives to prepare herself, but it turns out to be
   Bumblebee
   , who cries upon seeing her threatening gesture and runs back to Cricket. The IceWing queen continues to demand that they leave as

   , and more of the LeafWings and SilkWings arrive. When Cricket mentions that
   HiveWings
   are descendants of
   Clearsight
   , Snowfall, seething with rage, smashes the diamonds on her wristbands together three times, and reveals that she had brought her entire army with her, using the gift of stealth to conceal their presence.

  <p key="00e301d6-4c31-4d2c-b52e-7d0cc32eff4f">
   Intimidated by the army, Hazel relents and agrees to leave her kingdom. Tsunami insults Snowfall and decides to lead the refugees south to the SandWing kingdom, where
   Moonwatcher
   and Luna are. Realizing that the route would lead them to the Great Ice Cliff, Lynx warns Hazel and decides that she and Snowfall will escort them safely across, with Snowfall electing to bring ten of her guards. After putting
   Ivory
   in charge of the IceWing kingdom, Snowfall flies with everyone to the southern border and she privately considers it to be the happiest day of her rule since she is not rearranging the names on the wall. She and Hazel talk to each other about being queen, the IceWings and LeafWings, and Hazel mentions the breath of evil. Snowfall presses and asks if it is Darkstalker and Hazel clarifies that it is a plant. She advises Hazel to watch her back and not trust anyone as a queen, and the refugees reach the far side of the tundra where
   Jerboa's hut
   is. Sundew reunites with Luna and tells her what happened to her friends back on Pantala. After Snowfall talks to Jerboa, Moonwatcher introduces herself and says that her vision is showing only the beginning, much to Snowfall's annoyance. Jerboa decides to let the refugees stay for a bit and
   Qibli
   proposes taking them to
   Sanctuary
   where they will be safe. Relieved that she will not have to attend to the gift of order for a little longer, Snowfall decides to keep going with them. Night falls and she notices that she cannot remove the ring on her talon. Giving up and believing that it will come off with palm oil, she falls asleep.

   She falls asleep and has a dream that she is
   Atala
   . She does not tell anyone about it. A short while later, after interrogating
   Lappet
   about SilkWings and LeafWings, she discovers that the ring of vision was the one behind her visions, and she attempted to get it off by hitting the ring onto a nearby rock. This failed, resulting in her talon feeling bruised and sore.

   Lynx demands Snowfall to tell her what is wrong, and she tells Lynx about the gift of vision, leading to an argument where Lynx warns her about how her paranoia and mistrust of other dragons will lead to her downfall before angrily storming away, convincing Snowfall to keep her problems to herself. She later asks Luna to use her
   flamesilk
   on the ring, but nothing happens other than Snowfall's wrist hurting.

   Snowfall asks Crystal what she is doing here, and
   Gharial

Crystal sorts things out with Snowfall, and she realizes Crystal is not plotting against her. Snowfall, Hazel, and the Pantalan refugees fly over to Sanctuary after hearing Moon's prophecy about Pantala. Tsunami invited the queens from each tribe to a meeting in Sanctuary. As Queen
   Thorn
   arrives with Qibli, Snowfall lapses into another vision, and this time she is Blue and Queen Wasp, from back on Pantala. Blue is forced to round up all the SilkWings in
   Cicada Hive
   so they can be contained until a new batch of the breath of evil is ready, while Wasp is furious that SilkWings keep disappearing from the Hives, so she stations soldiers in Cicada Hive, Blue included, to finally catch whoever is warning the SilkWings. Once the vision is over, she and Queen Thorn went for a long flight and they came back to the town square, where Tsunami and Sundew are arguing. As the other queens begin to arrive, Snowfall falls into yet another vision, ordering

   The night before Snowfall returned to the Ice Kingdom, she had no visions. She woke up some time past dawn, and she sees Lynx and Crystal. Snowfall realized that Crystal was trying to hide her nervousness by looking bored. She tells Crystal that she will not have her killed if she returned to the Ice Kingdom unless Crystal was coming to steal the throne. Crystal replies, saying she has no interest in taking the throne. Snowfall then adds that Crystal has permission to marry Gharial. Snowfall then starts talking about the council with the other queens and has a small talk. They say goodbye and leave for the Ice Kingdom. As Snowfall flies towards the Great Ice Cliff, she thinks about what would happen if the othermind landed in the Ice Kingdom, and about how the IceWings would need connections to the other tribes.

At the gift of order, Snowfall asks Mink if she knows what what the gift of order is. Mink replies that the dragons above her are better than her and that she is better than the dragons below. Snowfall replies that Mink was correct, but it did not make sense, as Mink might do a math test better than the dragonet below her, but he might make a better ice sculpture. Mink is shocked at this and Snowfall quickly says that it is a maybe, and Mink calls out to the dragonet below her,
   Polar Bear
   , that she still loves him anyway. Snowfall contemplates whether she should have explained later, and smashes her fist into the gift of order. Tundra shrieks and charges Snowfall, but Snowfall batted her away and continued destroying the wall. Once she finished, Tundra was staring at the rubble as if it might come back, and Lynx was separating Tundra from Snowfall to keep her from charging at Snowfall again, then Tundra fainted, and had to be taken to her room while she recovered. Snowfall went to bed, and dreamed about herself in the forbidden treasury, with an animus IceWing named
