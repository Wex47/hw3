    HiveWings
   </b>
   are one of the three tribes that live on
   Pantala
   . HiveWings are currently the dominant tribe of Pantala, as they killed off almost all the
   LeafWings
   in the
   Tree Wars
   and enslaved the
   SilkWings
   . Their scales primarily include shades of red, yellow, orange, and always some black, but some may have variations such as dark green, as seen in

   , HiveWings can be red, yellow, and/or orange, but always have some black scales due to their shared common ancestor, Clearsight. HiveWings have a slightly compact face, with a smaller axe-like ridge on the tip of their snout, and a larger curved ridge on their forehead. Some HiveWings, such as

   . They have a pair of long, curved, and smooth-looking horns that raise slightly above their head, the tips curving slightly forward, giving them an almost regal appearance. Long, thin spikes go down their spines, to the tip of their tails, which have a slightly larger spine. They may also have wrist spikes. Some are hatched with stingers in their wrists or tails. HiveWing eggs are white.

   , Wasp's relatives who rule the other Hives aren't titled as Princess, but Lady. However, the Queen still outranks the Ladies. Despite this, she still allows others to rule the Hives, so they feel like they have at least some power. It's also difficult for HiveWings to get a divorce because they need permission from Queen Wasp in order to do so.
   If Wasp allows a HiveWing couple to get divorced, they have to go through a whole separation request process. It is unknown what kind of work HiveWings need to do in order to become divorced but the process is difficult.
   HiveWings who become partners without the queen's approval are severely punished.

   HiveWings also use SilkWings as servants, and use them for personal gain in many ways, such as using them as cooks, butlers, and other jobs. Most HiveWings  own SilkWing servants as an accessory, often striving to make them look more extravagant than the others. They often made them stand in windows just looking pretty, or paraded them around.

   According to the Pantalan dragon guide, the HiveWings' powers can vary from dragon to dragon, though some do not have any powers. These abilities are genetic and can be passed down. Their abilities include deadly stingers extending from their wrists, venom or a paralyzing toxin in their claws, stingers, or teeth, boiling acid that can be shot from a stinger on their tail, and emanating a horrible stench said to smell like dead rotting things pickled in sulfur.

   describes the paralyzing toxin as fire burning every nerve in your body. When it wears off, all you want to do is run or fly or even blink, but you can't move.
   A dragon paralyzed by HiveWing venom can be unparalyzed when given a strong stimulant.
   HiveWings also have a precise internal clock which was described to keep their days on schedule and warn them when the rainy season is coming.
