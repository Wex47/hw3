   . Their horns are curved, almost RainWing-like in shape, but much longer and thinner. There is also a set of antennae on the brow above the eyes. The ridge above their eyes runs over their horns, giving SilkWings a plated appearance. SilkWings have two pairs of wings, one pair smaller than the other, with membranes that have rounded edges. SilkWings have butterfly-like wings, which appear similar to butterfly or moth wings in shape. Their wings also can have spots and other patterns.
   The bigger pair of wings appear to have four digits that the membrane is stretched between. The smaller pair of wings are attached slightly below the larger pair and have two digits. According to

   on the Wings of Fire Forums, SilkWings' wings are just as strong as any dragon's wings,
   rather than weak like an insect's.

   SilkWings can be any color except black, such as olive green, aquamarine, lavender, indigo, amber, orange, dark purple, peach, gray, and red. They sometimes have darker accent colors on their scales. The wing membranes appear to be different colors too, as well as certain segments between the digits being a different color than the rest of the wing.

   SilkWings can use their antennae to sense vibrations in the air,
   and are able to predict the weather. At six years old, SilkWings undergo Metamorphosis. They go into a cocoon, emerging with two pairs of wings and silk glands in their wrists. Metamorphosis is preceded by aching wing buds, experiencing a nervous and fuzzy feeling, and itchy silk glands.

   Some SilkWings have the ability to produce flamesilk. Flamesilk is used by the HiveWings to create glass and illuminate inside of the hives, though different types can be made for different purposes, including a type that emits heat and does not burn the holder. Flamesilk dragons cannot be burned by flamesilk,
   but they are not immune to regular fire.
   This ability is genetic, and if one parent is a flamesilk, their offspring have a fifty percent chance of being flamesilk as well.

   notes that flamesilk is expensive, and that a single strand can last a whole moon cycle.

   SilkWings have been separated by the HiveWings ever since Queen Wasp took over their tribe. They do not have a voice in the Hives' government system. Under Wasp's rule, SilkWings are second class citizens and servants who have almost no rights compared to HiveWings. Examples of a regular SilkWing's occupation would include: construction workers, like Swordtail, hive drones (servants) like
   Silverspot
   , web workers, like
   Burnet
   , and other low-ranked jobs, like stall owners or weavers. It has been mentioned that the most disobedient SilkWings are typically assigned construction work given that it is considered to be very unpleasant.
   LeafWings are taught that SilkWings are not allowed to go to school,
   though this is not the case. SilkWings attend school much like HiveWings do, and are assigned emergency drills as a practice to protect themselves in case a web is falling or if they have to get to a Hive quickly for safety.
   They also learn about silk weaving, web structure, the history of LeafWing wars, and especially following directions.
  </p>
  <p key="3aa78079-b065-480d-942e-d304f62ac7f1">
   SilkWings are not allowed to divorce,
   and are assigned partners by Wasp and her sisters, rather than choosing their own.

   SilkWings are branded on their right
   palm at a very young age.
   The SilkWing's initial on their palm is a big letter, while their parent's initials are smaller letters,
   forming a triangle shape.

   SilkWings are also cuffed at a young age. These wrist cuffs have their school and other personal information inscribed on it
   so they can be identified at checkpoints.
   All cuffs can inject toxin into the wrist to make dragons fall asleep.
   Bands can be cut off by using flamesilk.
