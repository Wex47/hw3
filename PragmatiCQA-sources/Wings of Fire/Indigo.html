       . Albatross discovered her spying on them, saying that Queen Lagoon would "not be pleased that you've seen her most secret project." Indigo, characteristically, was defiant and acted as though she did not care. When Fathom told her excitedly that he was about to do his first enchantment, Albatross told them that they were done with their first lesson and left them alone at the Summer Palace.

       Indigo and Fathom begun to build a sea castle on the beach. As they did this, Fathom wondered why Albatross suddenly decided to quit. Indigo speculated that it was because he was old and boring, and then asked to Fathom whether he thought the queen would stop them from being friends. Fathom declared that he would never let the queen do that. Indigo still looked worried, so he used his first enchantment to make an octopus out of driftwood for her, despite her protests that they should wait. Even so, Indigo loved it immediately and named the octopus
        Blob
        by saying, "He's clearly a Blob. Aren't you, Blob?"

       Indigo was present at the start of The Royal SeaWing Massacre, and she and Fathom later ran to one of the above-water pavilions to hide when they realize that Albatross was killing any dragon he saw. Indigo told Fathom that he was the most likely next target. Indigo and Fathom were hiding under a boat when Albatross came into the pavilion, and Indigo got out from under the boat and attacks Albatross, trying to give Fathom time to escape. Instead, Fathom ordered the spears to kill his grandfather, and Indigo seized Albatross's snout to smother any spell he might try to cast. The spears eventually do kill Albatross, but Indigo fell and almost died. Fathom saved Indigo's life by using the pearl necklace that she was wearing. When the massacre ends, Fathom named Indigo as the dragon that killed Albatross, keeping his fatal use of his powers a secret. She was then named the 'Animus Killer.'

       Years pass until Indigo saw Fathom again. Queen Pearl kept the two dragonets away from each other because it was clear they were in love. When Fathom found out about Darkstalker being an animus, he decided to go to the Night Kingdom, and Indigo volunteered to go with him. They also take two other guards,
        Wharf
        and
        Lionfish
        . When they arrive, they attend a party where they first met Darkstalker. Indigo was immediately suspicious of Darkstalker, even to the point where she held a razor-sharp dagger to his throat. That was when Darkstalker made up his mind that he needed to 'dispose' Indigo.

       A month passed, and Darkstalker got his chance. He enchanted a pebble to, when thrown into the room Indigo was in, trap her inside the carving of a SeaWing Fathom made for him. For a good part of the story, she was inside the carving. Fathom finally got her out many days later after reading the enchantment, clutching the carving and enchanting it to release her. While he did that,

      The two fly away to a secret island, never to be seen by the mainlanders again. They had three dragonets together: Cowrie, Ripple, and Clearpool. They passed animus blood down through the line until eventually one of their dragonets finds their way back to the other SeaWings.

   Since they were tiny dragonets, Fathom was Indigo's best friend. He rarely went anywhere without her, and they'd been together almost since hatching.
    Some of Fathom's memories alongside her included claw painting, hours spent carving a dolphin out of wood for her, filling out their fish journals for every variety in the sea, and her teasing him for taking their tutors so seriously.
    Fathom considered her smile the best in Pyrrhia, and they were often physically affectionate.
    He was reassuring towards her,
    and his affection towards her was noticeable to other dragons.
    He looked at her like he loves her, and created treasure for her out of his own talons; likewise, she brought him what he needed before he asked for it.
    He considered their relationship platonic until the night of the Royal SeaWing Massacre, when he realized that the happy flutters in his heart whenever he saw Indigo indicated that he was in love with her.

   After the massacre, Fathom considered being separated from Indigo the worst punishment of all.
    Even after being separated from her for an entire year, seeing her in Pearl's throne room brought memories and longing and despair crashing back to Fathom. He would do anything to save her, even giving up his entire soul.
    He wanted desperately for her to accompany him to the lost city of night, but also considered how dangerous it would be for Indigo.
    She is protective towards him
    and spent hours training after the massacre so that no dragon could hurt Fathom ever again.
    She often felt sympathetic towards Fathom.
    Despite her experiences with Albatross' animus magic, she did not consider Fathom dangerous, and he missed her very much while they were separated.
    She refused to leave him, and trusted him immensely.

   After Indigo smashed the goblet that Darkstalker created for Fathom, he chose Wharf to accompany him to the Royal Tower instead of Indigo. She was wrought with hurt and disbelief,
    but although Fathom was upset with her, he understood her protectiveness, and wanted her to stay within their chambers for her own safety.

   After fleeing the lost city of night and settling down together on an island near the Rainforest Kingdom, Indigo was eventually able to convince Fathom that it was all right for him to be happy, and that he was not a monster because of his animus magic.
