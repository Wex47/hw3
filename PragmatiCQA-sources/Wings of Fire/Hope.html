   As a dragonet, Hope was scatterbrained, likely to blurt whatever she was thinking, and passionate over things that most other dragons found pointless. She was loudmouthed, hopeful, and slightly strange. She had a sharp tongue, but was not the kind of dragon to leave others in danger.
   She laughed and grinned often.
   She did not typically follow orders, and she was sarcastic and interesting.

   When Winter appeared horrified by the enchantment that imprisoned Hope to the Diamond Caves, she only shrugged eloquently in response.

   nervous,
   patient,
   loyal,

   and caring, and although she sparks with anger from snout to tail, there is immense room inside her for love.
   She feels guilty whenever she upsets her loved ones,

      To win the Diamond Trial, one must defeat Foeslayer and then kill the opposition. When
      Hailstorm
      and Winter found her in the Diamond Caves, Hailstorm touched his narwhal spear to the layer of ice covering her, cracking it off. He then attacked her. Foeslayer fought back and immobilized him, but when she moved in to kill him, Winter attacked her to protect Hailstorm. After a short conversation about the history of her imprisonment and an explanation of how Diamond's enchantment worked, she let Hailstorm kill her, telling him to "Make it quick." Afterward, Hailstorm then revealed that he had been told in advance that one of them has to kill the other to win the Diamond Trial.

       Hailstorm agreed to let Winter sneak off and pretend he was killed instead of Hailstorm having to kill his brother. When Hailstorm left, Winter tapped his spear to Foeslayer's ice again and cracked it, and she remarked that she has never been woken up by the same dragonets twice. Winter then demanded why Foeslayer stole Prince Arctic, but she objected to the word "steal" and told Winter that they fell in love with each other, so Prince Arctic ran off with her, knowing the IceWings would not accept this. Winter felt sympathetic to the love she had for Arctic, comparing it to the feelings he has for
       Moonwatcher
       , and decided to set Foeslayer free.

      Winter figured out that he needed to use frostbreath on the base of the chains to break off the
      animus-touched
      shackles that kept Foeslayer from escaping the Diamond Caves. Before he broke them off, he asked her to promise to leave the IceWings alone. She agreed, stating she never wanted to see another IceWing ever again and said that she was going straight back to the (old) Night Kingdom. Winter decided that this would be a chance to find the
      lost city of night
      since Foeslayer and Darkstalker are the only ones who know where it was hidden. He hoped that after finding it, he would be able to rejoin his friends and save

He told her that he didn't trust Darkstalker because he killed his father and Foeslayer later gave him a map to the location where

      to the balcony. She was shown talking and jumping around to try to warm herself up, and she eventually annoyed Snowflake into leaving. After learning the reason why Snowflake was so irritable was that Arctic forgot her name, she teased Arctic about it. The two proceeded to talk and flirt for a while. Eventually, to stay and talk with her for a while longer, Arctic enchanted his diamond earring to keep the wearer warm and protected, then gave it to Foeslayer, although he was aware that doing so was defying the IceWing heritage and law of only using
       animus
       magic once in a lifetime. This made her very surprised and worried about Arctic's soul.
      <p key="dc5f955f-6b58-431a-afa4-a25378c6e66d">
       In the first chapter, Foeslayer was heard arguing with Arctic over what would be best for their two eggs. When the first one hatched, she named the dragonet Darkstalker. Arctic said that it sounded creepy, like he was stalking in the darkness, but she retorted that it sounded heroic, like he was following the darkness and chasing the shadows away. Arctic reluctantly agreed to the name but claimed he got to name the other dragonet, their daughter, Whiteout.
      </p>
      <p key="6d344f0e-1ed3-47d4-a1c7-4f8fb9567fa8">
       About three years after Darkstalker and Whiteout hatched, Darkstalker came home to Foeslayer arguing with Prince Arctic about whether he should leave or stay in the Night Kingdom after Queen Diamond sent him a message that offered him amnesty if he returned to her and he killed his dragonets. Foeslayer was shocked, but Arctic told her that he would not accept it, and just wanted her to know what he could do if the topic came up again.
      </p>
      Later, Darkstalker enchanted a map to reveal the location of his mother after finding her enchanted earring discarded inside his house after a fight with Arctic. The red dot showed her frozen in place in the
       Ice Kingdom
       , and he presumed her to be dead, not aware that she had been enchanted by Queen Diamond and trapped in the Diamond Caves.

      Foeslayer was in the IceWing palace dome right after she met Prince Arctic for the first time.
       Prudence
       , Foeslayer's mother, came over and asked where she was. Prudence noticed Foeslayer's new earring recently given to her by Arctic and asked if she stole it, which Foeslayer gave her mother a version of the truth, saying that an IceWing gave it to her. This led to a squabble broken up by Arctic, who had just walked in the room, trying to protect her from punishment. Prudence was confused about who Arctic was and why he was trying to protect her daughter. Foeslayer finally admitted to Prudence, that she met Arctic earlier, and Prudence became angry because she had told Foeslayer earlier to keep silent and not interact with any of the IceWings. Prudence punished Foeslayer by sending her to her chambers. While walking there, Foeslayer saw Snowflake who was supposed to marry Arctic, which made her feel worse because she loves Arctic and wanted him to herself.
      <p key="fdddc96e-32b4-4b5d-aaf9-c858c078ed96">
       Foeslayer was locked in her chambers for two days. On the last day of their visit, Foeslayer and Prudence were seen packing up and getting ready to leave. Foeslayer was annoyed that Arctic never visited her in two days and now she would have to leave him forever. Prudence was scolding her about her pacing when she suddenly froze in place. Foeslayer was surprised to see Arctic walk through the wall of her chambers, and Foeslayer realized that he was using his animus magic to escape his kingdom and go with her so they could be together. Arctic and Foeslayer had a happy reunion, and he enchanted Foeslayer's earring so that she could not be harmed by any of Diamond's spells. Arctic then unfroze Prudence and persuaded her to go to the Night Kingdom with them. The three of them went together back to the hallway to escape. As Arctic froze IceWing guards in their way, Prudence revealed to her that she was letting Arctic come with them in hopes that Foeslayer and Arctic had dragonets and passed the animus gene to the NightWing tribe. Prudence then went to get the other two NightWings that came along with them,
        Starclaws
        and
        Discretion
        , Foeslayer swore to herself to never tell Arctic what her mother just told her.

      Snowflake and

       spot the two fleeing and sent a huge wave of IceWing guards after them. The guards shot arrows at Foeslayer, but they swerved away from her due to her earring's enchantment. Arctic enchanted the guard's spears to stop them, and the spears killed the guards, which was not what Arctic meant to do. Snowflake then caught up with them, shouting at Arctic that he should never be happy. Foeslayer then breathed fire and Arctic enchanted it to fly over and burn Snowflake's wing, making her fall onto the snow below. They then flew to a cliff and met up with Prudence and the rest of the NightWings. Prudence offered Foeslayer one of the enchanted bracelets to survive the harsh, cold weather ahead of them, but Foeslayer declined, saying that her earring would save her. The group flew toward the Night Kingdom. Foeslayer asked Arctic if his soul was okay, which he replied saying that it was none of her business. When she told him that it was, Arctic just growled and looked at her with a smug expression. Foeslayer convinced herself that she would make Arctic happy again and that he and she would be together forever.

   When Arctic first met Hope, he found his wings responding in a way that matched her own. Hope laughed and grinned with him, and he found himself unable to stop smiling at her. He thought that perhaps nothing would ever be boring or frustrating again so long as they were together, and he would do anything to spend a few more minutes with her. He broke his animus vow for Hope, and longed for her to view him as a dragon who did not care much for rules. He brushed his wing with her own, and promised her that his soul was hers, if she wanted it.
  </p>
  <p key="fe9b5509-d03a-4ab8-b917-f1c1ce05f5f9">
   In later stages of their relationship, Arctic threatened Hope after she made a joke towards him,
    and Darkstalker sensed that his mother was in danger.
    There was fury, bitterness,
    suspicion, hatred, and emanating outrage from both partners.
    They often argued
    and squabbled
    loudly,
    and Hope was irritated with Arctic for staying within their home and complaining constantly.
    Although Arctic believed Hope only loved him for his animus magic, in truth, she disliked his magic and wished he had not been an animus. In fact, she stated she loved him more than anything.

  <p key="f499567c-365d-4280-9531-b9e4fe239866">
   However, he still loves her; when Darkstalker hatched, he sensed a small, warm ember of love for Hope hidden under layers of ice.
    He could not bear to keep secrets from her,
    and worried about her safety.
    In one of Clearsight's visions, he was crying over a painting of Foeslayer by Whiteout.
    They were still physically affectionate with one another in the later stages of their relationship.
    She truly loved him.

   During Darkstalker's hatching, Hope's mind shimmered with excitement,
    and she considered him strong.
    She adored him from hatching, heart and soul, and cared about him very deeply;
    she named him Darkstalker as an allusion to chasing back the darkness, like a hero.
    She was supportive of his relationship with Clearsight, and smiled at him often.
    She worried about Vigilance's intentions to use Darkstalker's animus magic, as she was concerned for the safety of her son.
    Darkstalker was willing to do anything to see his mother again after awakening from his enchantment,
    and he appeared desperately hopeful at the prospect of seeing her.
    He sobbed when they were reunited.

   Although Prudence was Hope's mother, she treated Hope poorly, commenting that she looked frightful and then seizing Hope's ear so harshly that she recoiled in pain. Prudence viewed Hope as smart-mouthed and wayward, as well as idiotic, brainless, and prone to catastrophe. Prudence was dismissive, and typically would act outraged if Hope refused something she offered, but as soon as Hope wanted something, Prudence would refuse to give it to her. Although Prudence was overbearing, Hope still cared about her, and refused to leave her mother in Diamond's claws while she and Arctic fled the Ice Kingdom together. When Hope confessed that she had fallen in love with Arctic, she expected her mother's yelling, disapproval, and abuse, and was surprised when she reacted more calmly.
