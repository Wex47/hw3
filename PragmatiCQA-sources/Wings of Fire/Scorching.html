   At least five thousand years ago, scavengers swarmed the continent. They were organized and advanced, being the dominant life form at the time.

   mentions that stories before the Scorching would be best described as legends and fairy tales due to how unlikely it was for scavengers to be as advanced as once thought.

   Eventually, the dragons united and overthrew the scavengers. The dragons then formed tribes, and each one appointed a

   , allowing them to form complex societies. This made it hard for scavengers to kill individual dragons. After the Scorching, transformation and resettlement occurred
   as well as constant warfare.
