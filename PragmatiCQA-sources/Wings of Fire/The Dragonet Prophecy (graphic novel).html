   Six years after the introduction, Kestrel and Clay face off against each other in the training cave. Kestrel is taunting Clay and ordering him to fight, but Clay is pleading against it all. In a fit of rage, Kestrel knocks Clay against the wall and pins him down, but then Tsunami steps in, telling Kestrel to stop picking on the MudWing after biting her vulnerable spot on her tail. In response, Kestrel reminds Tsunami that she is defending the dragonet who "tried to kill her." Tsunami responds that she knows they were there to save him and that she gets to hear about the story constantly. Kestrel leaves the room after that, claiming that they were already done, and Tsunami begins talking to Clay, trying to cheer him up by telling him when she is the queen of the SeaWings, she will take care of the grumpy SkyWing.

   Tsunami and Clay briefly share their questions about their origins and whether their parents are still searching for them. Then, Tsunami expresses her "readiness" to save Pyrrhia as a prophecy dragonet, while Clay says he is not sure. Their discussion is interrupted by cows' mooing, which means dinner for them, and they race together. Clay makes it to the study cave and thinks about how the only good thing about growing up under the mountain is his friends,

   After they finish acting it out, Starflight explains Blister, Blaze, and Burn's alliances and personalities. They then think about which one they should pick, but the dragonets are not sure yet. Clay asks which side the NightWings are on, but Starflight explains that they're not involved in the war, and Tsunami says it is because they're so mysterious and so powerful. Clay says if the NightWings can see the future, they would know who wins the war, and the war could stop right now. Tsunami says that the NightWings should just tell everyone already so they can go home. Clay asks about the RainWings being in the war, and Starflight says they're not involved in the war either. Glory gets angry and says that nobody would want them as allies because they're too lazy and stupid. Clay and Sunny try to reassure Glory, and everyone looks at Glory with a sorry type of glance. Then Tsunami distracts Sunny by asking her to find the weird bug she had caught at dinner, and then Sunny leaves the studying cave to find it.

   Tsunami and the other dragonets talk about how they want to escape,  then they hear the entrance boulder crash closed. The dragonets then run off to figure out what is going on. Starflight and Glory hide in the shadows near the cave, and Tsunami and Clay hide in the river. They then see Webs, Kestrel, and Dune talking about

   , and shortly after, Dune tells them that Morrowseer has arrived. The dragonets of destiny come out of their hiding spots to see Morrowseer, and Clay worries about how Morrowseer will react to them and if he can genuinely read minds. Tsunami then goes up to Morrowseer and asks if he can get them out of the caves. Kestrel then looks harshly at Tsunami, calling her an ungrateful lizard. Morrowseer then sees Glory and gets very upset, talking about her with a disgusted tone. Kestrel explains that there was an accident and that they lost the SkyWing egg, and then tells Morrowseer that Webs brought Glory here. In defense, Webs says at least they have five dragonets, and that's what matters. He looks at Sunny and comments that it is more like they have four and a half dragonets. He then asks if Sunny is supposed to be a SandWing and if she even eats enough. The other dragonets besides Glory stand up for her. Tsunami says she eats and that she is a good fighter, and Starflight says it is not Sunny's fault that she is small. Then Clay comments that Glory is a good fighter too.

  <p key="7905b54c-b00e-402b-8aae-fdc5f33aad50">
   Morrowseer then tells them to stop talking, and they stop and stare at him fearfully. Morrowseer says that something went very wrong, and Tsunami butts in saying that something did indeed go very wrong and that they are kept like prisoners in the caves, and how it does not make sense to know how to save the world if they have not even seen it. Dune then tells Tsunami to hold her tongue. Morrowseer says he has had enough with Tsunami and then whips her in the face with his tail. Clay then jumps on top of Morrowseer, trying to protect Tsunami, and then bites him, but Morrowseer's scales are too hard to deliver any damage. Morrowseer then quickly shifts, knocking Clay off his back, and Tsunami scratches at Morrowseer's underbelly. Tsunami then falls off of Morrowseer, and she fiercely faces him while Clay tries to recover. Clay tries to think of a strategy to stop Morrowseer, but Sunny sneaks around Morrowseer and bites him in the weak spot near the tip of his tail. Morrowseer is surprised at her intelligence.

  <p key="471a6dd4-f38f-4edf-9257-3a478825750c">
   Clay then thinks that Sunny is a good fighter, fierce and brave, possibly thinking that Morrowseer will hear him. He then wonders why the guardians did not try to help them. Morrowseer picks up Sunny and, when she lets go of his tail, sets her down. He says that Clay and Tsunami are acceptable, and he will have to see if Sunny is acceptable. Then he looks at Starflight and tells him he assumes he used his powers to see that he was not going to harm Tsunami and that he would take him into the next cavern for a private conversation. Clay looks nervously at Starflight, and Starflight looks sad. Morrowseer then tells the guardians that they will talk about Glory later. Then Morrowseer and Starflight go into a cave, and then Kestrel scorns Tsunami by saying: "How dare you complain about us?" Tsunami then says she was only telling Morrowseer the truth. Then Kestrel says if it were not her job to keep her alive, she would have strangled Tsunami herself a long time ago. Then Kestrel leaves. Tsunami sarcastically says that Morrowseer was a great help. In the background, Tsunami jumps into the river.

   Clay asks if Glory is all right, and Glory says she is. She says that they all knew that Morrowseer would hate her, saying that the guardians have not talked about how awesome she is the whole time. Sunny then asks why Glory did not fight Morrowseer because if she did, then Morrowseer and the guardians would know how brave and fierce she is. Glory says, "Why bother?" and that it was obviously a test as her scales shift from purple and yellow to blue. Clay asks if it was, and Glory confirms it to be true and that she failed it the day she hatched as a RainWing. Clay then says he does not care what the prophecy says or what Morrowseer thinks of her and that she is their fifth dragonet. Glory says that what he said is sweet and then says she will take a nap and heads off to a nearby cave. Sunny asks if taking a nap is a good idea at the time, and Glory says that Morrowseer and the guardians think she is lazy anyway and that there's nothing she can do change that. Then she tells them to wake her if anything exciting happens, but not if it is exciting according to Sunny. Clay then wonders why the prophecy did not include Glory. Then Sunny says, "Hmph!" and says that she does not think

Sunny says they could not complete the prophecy without the guardians because the Talons understand what to do and that everything will be okay as long as they follow the prophecy. Clay says that she is probably right but then wonders if the prophecy is wrong.
  </p>
  <p key="65fbbee9-e12c-4087-a747-5087ef780235">
   Then Morrowseer and Starflight come out of the cave they were in, and Clay calls him over and asks if he is all right and what Morrowseer said to him. Starflight says he is not supposed to talk about it, and then he goes into a cave with some scrolls in it, including his favorite scroll. Starflight tells Clay that Morrowseer said to him that he has a lot to learn. Clay then says that Starflight already knows everything and that he is the smartest dragonet in all of Pyrrhia. Clay notices that Starflight is looking for his favorite scroll and then points it out to him, and Starflight opens it and starts to read it. Clay then remembers that Starflight likes to read his favorite scroll when he is really upset.
  </p>
  <p key="34263266-4028-4f73-99b2-ef42da18f9f7">
   Clay then tells Starflight that he thought that Morrowseer thought he was better than any of the other dragonets and that he said that Starflight is a great and noble dragon that he must be because he is a NightWing. Starflight then says that that was precisely what Morrowseer told him. Clay asks if Morrowseer told him when he would get his powers, but Starflight says he needs to study. Clay asks Starflight about what Morrowseer said about Glory, and Starflight says that Morrowseer did not say much except for that he would "take care of the RainWing." Clay asks what that means, and Starflight says he is not sure, but she might be able to go home. Clay believes that Morrowseer and the guardians would never let that happen. All of a sudden, they hear Sunny yelling out, saying: "Stop! You don't have to do this!"
  </p>
  <p key="b230a69b-6229-4383-92af-fb0146afce2a">
   Clay and Starflight then quickly come out of the cave and see Dune and Webs tying up Tsunami to a rock column using chains. Morrowseer has wrapped his tail around Sunny, restricting her from trying to stop them. Sunny then cries out: "What are you doing? Let her go!" Kestrel breathes fire on the chains to melt them together. Sunny asks why the guardians are doing this, and that Tsunami is wonderful, and that if anyone can save the world, it is her. Morrowseer then tells her that the dragon she should follow is Starflight and that NightWings are natural leaders. Tsunami then rages at Kestrel, about to say about what her family would do if they heard about how the guardians treated her, but Kestrel quickly cuts her off, saying that Tsunami's hopes for a wonderful family are far too high and that nobody cares about her, and that when it is time to fulfill the prophecy, she will be alive, the Talons of Peace will have her, and that's all that matters. She then tells Tsunami that a little time away from the river will teach her to be more grateful for what she has. Morrowseer then lets go of Sunny and then tells the guardians that he will be back tomorrow to make sure everything has been "dealt with." Kestrel says she understands, and then Morrowseer leaves. Sunny then begs the guardians not to leave Tsunami chained up, saying she knows they're not that mean. Webs then says it is for their own good and that they only want to keep them safe. Webs is about to say that it might not be the perfect way, but before he says more, Kestrel cuts him off by telling the dragonets to go to bed and that she does not want to hear a squawk out of anyone until morning. Tsunami then taunts Kestrel, telling her: "Really? What else are you going to do to me? What if I feel like singing all night?" Then she begins to sing the Dragonet Prophecy song. Glory complains, Dune tells Webs that it is his fault for teaching them the song, Sunny sings along, and Clay hums along. Kestrel interrupts Tsunami's singing by threatening to chain up her friends, sarcastically saying that Clay would like to spend the night hanging from a stalactite. Tsunami stops singing, and Kestrel says: "Much better." Kestrel and the rest of the guardians leave the room, and Kestrel says to the dragonets that they were all acting vile and that they're lucky that she did not chain them all up.

   Clay tries to free Tsunami afterward, but Tsunami tells him to stop, saying he has to find out what the guardians are planning. He overhears their plot to kill Glory to appease Morrowseer. After much thought, the group frantically decides to send Clay down the freezing underground river to escape to the outside and return to free them.

When Clay tries to return the treasure, she twists Clay's talons, then tries to get them to return to her palace with her. Then Tsunami impales Scarlet's tail to the ground to escape, and they flee towards the peaks. Afterward, they see the smoke signal from the other dragonets to locate the caverns they were trapped in and go to rescue them. However, the signal also attracts Scarlet, and the SkyWings take the entire group (minus Dune, who is killed by Queen Scarlet, and Webs, who escapes) hostage.
