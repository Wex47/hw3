   was missing. One by one each dragon went missing until Starflight hid and Glory, most luckily, dodged something, that turned out to be a tranquilizing dart, and that all of her friends had lapsed into unconsciousness. Glory ordered the mystery dragons that remained hidden, to show themselves. The "mystery dragons" turned out to be RainWings. Glory met the two of them,
   Liana
   and
   Jambu
   , who offered to take them to the

   While her friends were unconscious from the darts, Glory took her first sun time nap in the rainforest. When she woke up, she felt better, her scales brighter and more beautiful. Then she found a sloth lying on her back, which she eventually named
   Silver
   . Jambu then showed her the village, and they learned that they are related using a venom test. There she learned that RainWings did not organize their eggs, she also learned that they did not use their venom on any other living being. They returned to find their friends waking and they went to go meet
   Magnificent
   . While waiting in line, she met
   Mangrove
   , a grumpy RainWing, who mentioned that his partner,
   <a href="Orchid.html" key="e4d13366-ce34-4842-a804-820503e23b0a" title="Orchid">
    Orchid
   </a>
   , was missing along with at least twelve other RainWings.
   Bromeliad
   , a venom trainer, mentioned that a dragonet named
   Kinkajou
   had also gone missing. Glory suggested that they go to the
   <a class="mw-redirect" href="Queen.html" key="6af0c3c5-24ca-4850-8c94-a59f5ff4ecff" title="Queen">
    queen
   </a>
   together since they were both there about missing dragons. When Mangrove, Bromeliad, and Glory saw Queen Magnificent, Glory suggested someone investigate, and Mangrove said Glory should find the missing RainWings, and Queen Magnificent agreed. When Mangrove and Bromeliad leave, Tsunami, Starflight, Clay, Webs, and Sunny came in and asked them to help Webs, which Queen Magnificent was reluctant about. After some prompting from Sunny, the queen directed them to the RainWing healers.

  <p key="fad2c30b-d33e-4da7-a0ee-99b7f0841683">
   After they left the queen's treehouse Tsunami, Webs, and Sunny headed off to the healer's hut, and Starflight and Clay joined Glory as she set out to find the missing RainWings. They spoke to Mangrove, and he leads them to a giant fallen tree. Glory picked up a horrible stink and asked Starflight if he could identify it since he seemed to have a stronger sense of smell. They found a dying sloth by a stream, which Clay put out of its misery. Glory looked around and discovered an
   animus-made tunnel
   to the
   Kingdom of Sand
   in a boulder. Starflight and Mangrove returned to the village while Glory and Clay stayed to watch the tunnel overnight. While they watched, something came by, ate the sloth, and disappeared. In the morning, Sunny, Tsunami, Starflight, and Jambu arrived, and they discussed what to do about the tunnel. They settled on Glory and Clay going in with vines. When they went through, they found themselves in the Kingdom of Sand, within sight of

   Glory and Clay took a look around from the mouth of the tunnel's end in the Kingdom of Sand before returning to the rainforest. The dragonets and Jambu talked over the missing RainWings and the tunnel. Then Mangrove suddenly dashed out of the trees and into the tunnel, flying off to the
   Ice Kingdom
   to try and find Orchid. Glory puts her sloth, Silver on a nearby tree and with the rest of the group, runs after Mangrove to the Ice Kingdom.

   After flying for the rest of the day, they settled down for the night in rocky terrain. In the morning, Glory flew ahead and saw Princess
   Blaze's fortress

   Deathbringer
   settling down. Using an

   Then Glory and Jambu, disguised as IceWings, went to meet

   who was staying at the Ice Kingdom. Deathbringer then attempted to kill Blaze after she was brought to the Dragonets. Blaze's neck was cut by one of the two "sharp silvery discs" and Tsunami's wing, after shielding Blaze, was also cut. Glory attacked Deathbringer when they heard the IceWings coming and took his weapons, using one to cut him in the neck. This made Deathbringer surrender and fly away before the IceWings got him after Glory gave him a choice to fly away in ten seconds or be imprisoned by the IceWings. In fear of getting imprisoned again, the Dragonets left, with Blaze's neck bandaged. Later when they returned to the rainforest, Glory was kidnapped by the NightWings. She escaped with the help of Clay, Deathbringer, and another captured RainWing named Kinkajou. When she got back, she told Magnificent about what had happened. Seeing that the NightWings had the missing RainWings, Magnificent refused to save them. As a result, Glory challenged Magnificent to the throne.

   In the Arboretum, Magnificent and Glory each assembled their teams. Jambu and

   competed in the tree gliding and Exquisite cheated, nearly killing Jambu.
   Tamarin
   , a blind RainWing, and
   Fruit Bat
   competed in the flower finding hunt. Tamarin won by finding the winning flower with her extremely good sense of smell. Glory and Magnificent competed in a camouflage contest, and Glory lost because Silver gave her away. Mangrove and
   Dazzling
   competed in a fruit scavenger hunt, and even though Dazzling cheated, Mangrove won by one point. The last contest was between Queen
   Grandeur
   and Kinkajou in venom shooting.

   In the distance part, Kinkajou lost. However, in the targeting part, Grandeur accidentally shot at a sloth, and Kinkajou shielded it, so the venom hit her wing instead. Glory panicked and tried to do the venom test. This reveals she was related to Grandeur, so she successfully saved Kinkajou. Grandeur, who was the original queen, realized Glory was the rightful queen and forfeited, making Glory the Queen of the RainWings. Then, Clay crashed in and told her that Starflight had left, and may have warned the NightWings that the RainWings would attack.
