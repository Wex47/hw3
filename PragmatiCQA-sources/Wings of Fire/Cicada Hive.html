   The Mosaic Garden is what Cicada Hive is known for. It is on the highest level of the hive and is on the right of the end of the tunnel from the Hive entrance.
   It is a giant garden filled with orderly flowers and hedges, located on gently sloping hills and grass, and crisscrossed with a seemingly random path that leads to the center. It is glimmering in droplets of amber and gold, cobalt and jade, obsidian and pearl.
   The garden contains different Mosaics depicting famous scenes. A notable mosaic is the Salvation Wall, a mosaic depicting the end of the

   The Cicada Hive marketplace is a huge, vaulted space that hums with activity. The best shops have permanent six-sided cells around the outer wall. All other shops are in stalls in the labyrinthian middle.
   Yellow and orange lanterns hang along silk filaments that hang on the ceiling. Blue describes these as "criss-crossing the ceiling like necklaces of tiny suns." Soldiers watch the market from balconies above, and they can be summoned by any HiveWing at any time. Some carry long, needle-like lances.
   There are many posters and murals of Queen Wasp all over the market, some depicting her claw stingers.
   The marketplace also has candy stores. The Sugar Dream is a candy store that generally only serves HiveWings, as the items sold are expensive and considered luxury items.
   It is owned by a HiveWing named
   Chafer
   .
   Droplets is another candy store more friendly to SilkWings, and it is the store that Blue and Luna usually go to.

   Misbehaver's Way is the prison of Cicada Hive. It is described as having pathways made of sharp, cobbled stone
   . HiveWings from an elite unit of soldiers inject offenders with a special nerve toxin that causes a dragon's muscles to stiffen, freezing them in place for one day.
   Prisoners can see, think, and feel while in this state, but may not move. They are placed on stone pedestals, accompanied by a tablet explaining their crime in dramatic detail. The pedestals have quotes about law and order from famous HiveWings, and a few from
   Clearsight

   Like all other SilkWing schools, attending students must wear a metal wristband with the school's name on it.
   The metal wristbands likely all have toxins used to paralyze runaway or fugitive SilkWings, though the only wristband that has been observed to have the toxins belonged to Blue. Silkworm Hall takes field trips twice a year to Misbehaver's Way to scare their students into obedience.

   The Cocoon is where SilkWings living in Cicada Hive undergo their
   Metamorphosis
   . It is on close to the lowest level in the Hive and is the main feature of the mostly empty level. It is a long oval dome two levels tall. When a SilkWing emerges from their cocoon, they are expected to create their first silk tapestry and donate it to the Cocoon as an offering of thanks, where they are used as decoration. Because of this, the Cocoon is swathed in so many weavings that it almost looks as if it is made out of silk itself.
   The entrance is low and arched and dimly lit by lamplight.
   Dragons going through metamorphosis will go through the archway to the Cocoon floor and any guests that come to watch will go to the balcony. The balcony, also referred to as the gallery, has ancient silver-silk carpets and goes all the way around the dome and overlooks the floor below. It is only lit by small candles floating in a central pool of water.

   The Lady Cicada art gallery is a section in Cicada Hive that is dedicated to its ruler, Lady Cicada. It is on one of the lower floors and is dimly lit. The art gallery has different rooms, including one for sculptures (made of wood, metal and marble) and one for tapestries. Luna's favorite room is the tapestry room, and her favorite tapestry depicts Lady Cicada flying with a long trail of radiant SilkWings behind her in the sky.

   Cicada Hive served as the setting during the first half of the book. Blue and Luna spent their time throughout the Hive before the latter's Metamorphosis. Upon being hunted, Blue became a fugitive and hid due to possibly being a
   flamesilk
   . He met Cricket at her school and they plotted to rescue Swordtail from Misbehaver's Way, then fled from the Hive soon after.
