   Clay often smiles at others,
   and is challenged by academic study.
   He is baffled and accidentally heroic,
   and sounds kind no matter who he talks to.
   It took him an entire day to realize that the palace of the SeaWings might be underwater, and he does not take to academic lessons very well.
   He is earnest,
   goofy,
   loyal, sweet,
   agreeable,
   easily confused,
   curious,
   thick-minded,
   and does not want to hurt dragons who could be possible allies.
   He almost never complains, except about being hungry.
   He is trustworthy, and every thought he has is written all over his face.
   Tsunami described him as being the heart of the dragonets of destiny, and stated that they would not be able to fulfill the prophecy without him.

It is instinctual for the first of a MudWing clutch to hatch to help the others out of their shells by breaking them, but with Asha being dead and unable to explain this, the rest of the guardians misunderstood this action and thought he was trying to kill them. Therefore, Clay was expelled into the river until the rest of the eggs hatched. Luckily, MudWings can hold their breath for an hour. Clay always felt bad for "attacking" the other dragonets of destiny as eggs and worried about his inner monster that

Clay had trouble in battle training with Kestrel, who periodically attacked him with fire and complained about how he was too gentle, demanding to see more of the "vicious little monster" that she had supposedly seen in him when he hatched, referring to his eggshell-breaking episode.

Clay eavesdropped on a talk between the guardians and Morrowseer through a river that ran throughout the entire cave and, overheard that they were planning to have Kestrel kill Glory the next night by snapping her neck. Tsunami was chained as part of this plot, as she was the only one who could stop Kestrel from killing Glory. Knowing that time was running out, Clay escaped through the underground river after a brief conversation about the possible consequences of doing so. Glory showed her friends her

Risking his life, and relying on his ability to hold his breath for an hour, Clay managed to get far down the river, but he was then covered with a substance that started to dissolve his scales. He was rescued from this unfortunate fate by Tsunami, who finally succeeded in escaping her chains with the aid of Sunny and Starflight's fire. After catching up to Clay, the two swam through the cave filled with glowworms and toxic sticky white substances until they burst outside, emerging from the waterfall that dropped at the cave entrance. This caused the two dragonets to start flying, or trying to fly, in Tsunami's case. After Clay got over the bout of excitement caused by his first flight, he noticed that Tsunami had rapidly fallen. Upon looking closer, Clay guessed one of her wings was dislocated, and this was the reason she was unable to fly properly. He barreled into a dive and sped towards her as fast as he could. He was not strong enough to stop her fall, but he was able to slow her down until they crashed into trees and thudded to the grassy ground.

Knowing they had to get back to their friends still trapped in the cave, they had no choice but to injure the regal SkyWing by stabbing the scavenger's sword into the vulnerable spot on her tail. They managed to quickly escape before Scarlet found them and find their cave and were able to free their friends shortly afterward, but were captured by the enraged Queen Scarlet, due to the smoke signal the remaining dragonets had set so that Tsunami and Clay could find the cave and free them.

       The following day was Queen Scarlet's hatching day, so she set up bloody plans for her and Burn's entertainment. The three confused dragonets (Starflight, Tsunami, and Clay) were taken to the balcony of the queens, on which Burn and Scarlet were seated on as well. He watched helplessly as Tsunami was forced to fight a mad SeaWing named

When Scarlet suggested Clay used what she thought was his venom, Glory shot venom from her front longest fangs at Burn, who shoved Scarlet in the way. The venom hit Scarlet in the side of her face, causing it to melt. They were then able to escape with Peril's help, and succeeded in rescuing Kestrel in the process, the action in which Clay and Sunny were the only supporters.

He seemed to think Starlight was a part of the dream. Clay was seen to be eating or "feasting" and was extremely pleased because his siblings were there with him. When Starlight returned to the Rainforest, Clay was the second Dragonet of Destiny to see him and was more than happy to see his best friend/brother back safely. When Starflight was injured by the volcanic explosion's fire, Clay sheltered him with his wings, protecting him and carrying him through the tunnel and out of danger, although the NightWing still lost his sight. The lava still burned Clay, and the fact that he risked all of that pain to save Starflight shows, again, his willingness to endure intense pain or death for his friends.

    Peril believed that Clay liked her how she was, and although Clay was hesitant towards her, he found that Peril was not entirely awkward, and possessed an awkwardness and sadness that he understood.
    He is honest with her,
    and she disobeyed Scarlet's orders in order to talk with him

    When talking to her, Clay's guilt about Fjord's death and his friends' capture seemed lighter,

    She avoided Clay after Osprey's death because she wanted to keep him out of danger,
    but she easily became angry
    and jealous when Clay mentioned how important Glory
    and Sunny were to him,
    and later betrayed Clay and his friends to Scarlet because she was afraid of him leaving.
    Clay felt sadness at her betrayal and guilt over trusting her afterwards,
    although he felt sympathy for Peril because she had no other friends.

Crane had died in the sibling's first battle, between Burn's and Blaze's forces, before Clay visited. If his egg was not taken by the Talons of Peace, Clay would have been the troop's bigwings.

He asked if Clay wanted to be their bigwings, but Clay turned Reed's offer down, knowing that Reed would do a much better job, having grown up with MudWings and having the complete trust and loyalty of all their siblings. When Starflight used his dreamvisitor, he saw Clay dream about his siblings. Starflight said that Clay's siblings were "more dragons we have to save in this war." Clay seemed shocked and saddened when Sora set off a dragonflame cactus in the school.

   die!" Clay also wanted to go save Sunny when she was trapped in a cage in the Sky Kingdom as soon as he learned where she was, after badgering Peril for the information. When Sunny wants to explain her idea about the darts in the RainWings' attack, she turns to Clay because she thinks he will listen. He seems to be the dragonet she confides in the most. Clay takes a poisonous viper bite to save Sunny's life and says he would do it over and over again if he could. He is one of the only dragons to take Sunny seriously, as shown when Clay paid attention to a "weird crab" Sunny found in the underground river.

   Tsunami is among Clay's closest friends. She found and cured him when Clay was drenched in the white ooze in the underground river and his scales were burning with pain. Also, she stabbed Scarlet's tail with a sword to allow herself and Clay to fly away from the SkyWing queen. Later, she calls Clay a "handsome idiot" and gives him a hint that Peril likes him, but he does not understand. Throughout the book, Tsunami often interjects when Clay talks about Glory and Sunny in front of Peril because she appears to understand that Peril gets jealous. After she and Clay escape from under the mountain, Clay notices how beautiful and shiny her scales were in full moonlight (he says that they looked like emeralds). In the sunlight after that, he said that she looked as if she were made of sapphires. In
