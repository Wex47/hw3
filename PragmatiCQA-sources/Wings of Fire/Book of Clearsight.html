   The Book of Clearsight was filled with about nine hundred years of visions. It was a way for Clearsight's descendants to know the future, telling them about all the dangers and disasters that could happen in a thousand years, from a huge increase in shark populations nearby to damaging hurricanes. Toward the end of the book, the predictions slowed down, with lots of question marks, while the last few pages were blank. The final prediction in the Book of Clearsight was over a thousand years before the events of

   Sundew pinned the Librarian down and was about to kill her when Cricket told her to stop. Cricket stated that it was not the Librarian that was fighting, but Queen Wasp. Sundew then instructed Cricket to release two bullet ants onto the Librarian. When the Librarian tried to knock one off of her, it bit her, forcing Wasp to leave the Librarian's body from the excruciating pain.
