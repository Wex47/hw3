   ), and Swordtail through the Poison Jungle to the LeafWing village, trying to protect them from the dangerous fauna. Swordtail asked Sundew if the rumors about the jungle's dangers were real, and Sundew responded that they were. She also noted that Queen
   <a href="Wasp.html" key="418dddc1-081f-4d48-b6c7-4ba553777600" title="Wasp">
    Wasp
   </a>
   had sent expeditions to the Poison Jungle — the rumors came from the HiveWings who survived and returned to tell the tale. She also said that Wasp once tried to burn down the Poison Jungle but failed. She also stated that the dragons who came to burn the Poison Jungle all died. Blue, Cricket, and Swordtail continued to argue about entering the jungle, but Sundew said that they do not have a choice. She warned the group not to touch anything that she had not touched first. They took a passage through some makahiya and moved across a branch, but Swordtail leaned down to sniff at a pink flower that turned out to be a
   Venus dragon-trap
   underneath them. It pulled him off of the branch and swallowed him whole.
  </p>
  <p key="358fa4da-f482-4101-8d1a-20fb86fff3d9">
   Cricket and Blue panicked, while Sundew was angry that Swordtail did not listen. Blue attempted to get Swordtail out, but Sundew pulled him back and told him not to touch. She shouted at Swordtail to stop thrashing since the plant would release him if he were motionless, but he did not hear her and continued to struggle. Cricket suggested slicing the Venus dragon-trap open to get Swordtail out, but Sundew told her that they had adapted to resist attacks from dragon claws and grow in clusters, so if somebody tries to help, they will also get eaten. Before she could do think of anything to do, Blue shot a strand of flamesilk at the Venus dragon-trap. Sundew yelled at Blue and then put out half of the fire with water from nearby bromeliad leaves. In an attempt to put out the rest of the fire, she used her
   leafspeak
   to grow a chokecherry tree up to her height. She grabbed the chokecherries from the tree and smeared them on burning branches, stopping the fire from spreading any further. Cricket helped by getting more water, and eventually, the fire was put out completely. The Venus dragon-trap holding Swordtail was dead, so Blue flew down and attempted to cut open the plant. Sundew yelled at Blue for nearly setting the jungle on fire, but they got Swordtail out of the dead plant. Sundew, Blue, Cricket, Swordtail, and Bumblebee got back on the branch to avoid the other carnivorous plants around them. Sundew yelled at the group again, reminding them that the Poison Jungle was dangerous and they should all listen to her. They continued along for a while, with Blue feeling guilty, Swordtail muttering under his breath, and Cricket holding Bumblebee. Cricket finally asked whether Sundew made the tree grow, and she was forced to reveal her power.

   , watched disapprovingly. Sundew made a thorn bush grow in the panther's way to kill it and revealed herself to the three LeafWings. Blue, Cricket, and Swordtail came down, and Wolfsbane and Nettle became hostile, but Sundew explained that Blue and the others were helpful. Nettle and Wolfsbane left to inform Commander
   Belladonna
   , while Mandrake volunteered to stay with the group. He introduced himself as Sundew's fiance, which prompted questioning from Cricket as to whether he was the one true love that Sundew had mentioned previously. Sundew was mad at herself for saying that to Cricket. They arrived at the LeafWing village and discovered that the flamesilk used to burn the hive was Blue's. This devastated Blue because he had been against the burning all along. After Belladonna treated them like prisoners, Cricket and Blue started to wonder if they could trust Sundew.

   Near midnight, Sundew snuck out, across the border towards the

Tsunami told them that Luna was alright, while Belladonna and Queen Sequoia argued about the future of the tribe. The LeafWing queen got down to business and asked, "Have you ever heard of the

   Queen Sequoia began to tell the legend. When dragons arrived on Pantala for the first time, they would be attacked by swarms of insects every night, all moving as one and seemingly united by one mind. After many deaths, the dragons discovered that cutting back the breath of evil, the vine that covered the entire continent, gradually made areas safe. Eventually, the plant had been removed from almost the whole continent. After telling the story, the queen asked Cricket, Willow, and Sundew to venture into the most dangerous part of the jungle and find
   <a href="Hawthorn.html" key="7d96090f-e83c-4f2c-8a5c-95dd93623ddc" title="Hawthorn">
    Hawthorn
   </a>
   , a LeafWing who guarded the small amount of breath of evil still growing in the jungle. Belladonna ordered Sundew to bring Nettle and Mandrake in addition to her choice of traveling companions. On the trip, Nettle fell and got trapped in a carnivorous plant, forcing them to cut it open with a thorn. Later, they came across the most dangerous obstacles of the journey so far, forcing them to fly across a lake. They all managed to cross until Sundew and Bumblebee were the only ones left. Sundew got close to the other side of the lake, but Bumblebee screamed and landed on Sundew's face. Blinded, Sundew was trapped by a sundew. After a little searching, she was able to attract an enormous tsetse fly and distract the plant. They made it the rest of the way across and discovered that the next part of their journey would be through the Den Of Vipers. After entering this area, they spotted
   <a href="Dragonbite viper.html" key="4c66eab6-1a31-4e57-8d1a-05c66a116ead" title="Dragonbite viper">
    dragonbite vipers
   </a>
   above them, behind them, and on their sides staring at them. They were not dead but were paralyzed in place. Once they were almost to their destination, the vipers all moved and cornered them. It turned out that the snakes had been mind-controlled by Hawthorn, who appeared and invited them in for tea.

   Nettle, Sundew, and Cricket left Bumblebee with Tsunami and traveled toward the LeafWing camp with Hawthorn's antidote, a root called the Heart of Salvation. When they arrived, they talked with Queen Sequoia and Belladonna about their plans to distribute the Heart of Salvation into the HiveWing army. They asked Blue to let them use his flamesilk to burn the root, hoping that fumes would have the same effect as consuming the root. He agreed, but on the terms that Belladonna and Queen Sequoia would not use any of it to harm another dragon.

  <p key="91d7ed1f-2997-4d5b-9ba9-a6a8e2395a79">
   While Blue and Swordtail went with the other LeafWings, Sundew slept for the night. When she awoke, she broke the news to Mandrake that she did not want to marry him, but he let her know that he already knew. The two decided to grow more of the antidote. As Sundew tried to reach it with her leafspeak, she felt some barrier, making it harder for her to talk to it, and when it finally grew, it turned into the breath of evil, whose premature root was disguised as the antidote. Sundew told Mandrake to stop, but it was too late — the fire had already been lit.
  </p>
  <p key="86f4c6fb-cd9e-42d4-b6a7-1d4a186fb0e5">
   As they panicked, Hawthorn appeared on the other side of the river with Willow beside him and a dragonbite viper poised at her neck, ready to strike. As Sundew, Mandrake, and Cricket landed, vines wrapped around their talons, trapping them. Sundew realized that the plant was talking through Hawthorn as he tried to soothe them into taking the breath of evil. Cricket tried to distract Hawthorn by asking how the plant worked as Sundew tried to find something that could help them escape. Sundew found a sundew in between Willow and Hawthorn and used her leafspeak to make it eat the viper and Hawthorn. It worked, but once Hawthorn was caught, he tried to strangle Cricket. At the same time, he attempted to use his leafspeak to free himself. Before he could do anything, though, Willow stabbed him with an enormous thorn, killing him instantly.

It turned out to be a map of the route from Pantala to Pyrrhia, using small uninhabited islands to rest along the way. They hurriedly planned to use this discovery to escape the continent. Io came in, asking to save the rest of the SilkWings, and Hazel reluctantly lets her have a quickly-made copy of the map. Io,
   Cinnabar
   , and several other SilkWings prepared to leave, but before they took off, Sundew asked them to bring Hemlock, Bryony, and Pokeweed with them. Suddenly, a LeafWing guard crashed into the pavilion with the news that Wasp and her army were setting the jungle on fire.

   into groups for evacuation. Willow approached Sundew and asked why she was not managing her tribe herself, and Sundew told her that she believed Mandrake would be better at the task at hand. After some prodding from Willow, Sundew admits that she does not want to run away from the othermind and was extremely angry about it. She was caught off guard when Willow said that she was also angry about everything that had happened to them. In a decisive moment, she told Sundew that not every dragon deserves her anger, despite Sundew's protests. She finally agreed with Willow, and the two lovers professed their feelings. Willow mentioned that Sundew needed to run to prevent the othermind from using her leafspeak to spread. The two dragons then took off with the rest of the LeafWing tribe, following the map towards Pyrrhia. Sundew thought about how they would come back to Pantala once they found help and dealt with the othermind once and for all.
