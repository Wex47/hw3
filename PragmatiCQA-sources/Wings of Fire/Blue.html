   Blue has gemlike azure
   and bright morpho butterfly blue
   scales, purple scales on his back,
   quiet lavender scales on his arms,
   azure talons,
   and a purple snout.
   His body glints with purple and aquamarine like buried jewels,
   and his wings shimmer purple and bright
   blue, like sapphires and violets tumbled together.
   Before his wings fully developed, his wingbuds were small and tightly curled, and an iridescent violet color, a brighter, more purple shade than the rest of his scales.
   He is fairly small, but larger than Cricket,
   and he and his biological parents' initials are carved into his right palm, forming a triangle. The larger B stands to his name, and a smaller B and A stand for
   Burnet
   and
   Admiral

   Cricket considers him to be quite beautiful.

   , Blue was described as being a dragon who "liked things the way they were." Blue believed that if someone offered him peace and stability in exchange for independence, he would accept without question.
   He was content with his life,
   and he feared change,
   often feeling waves of panic when he thought about going into
   Metamorphosis
   .
   He also never felt any desire to go beyond his birthplace, Cicada Hive.
   He believed that the
   HiveWings
   protected the SilkWings from the
   LeafWings
   , despite
   Luna
   's remarks.

   After saying something that mildly upset Luna, Blue instantly felt guilty and apologized to her.
   He worries about hurting other dragons' feelings.
   He dislikes arguing with other dragons,

   He also often feels anxious,
   and believes that he is not dangerous.

   and he could not begin to imagine stabbing another dragon on purpose.
   He believes that he is a good dragon,
   and he is tentative
   and loyal.
   He also believes that stealing is wrong,
   and he cares about all dragons, even those he has never spoken to.
   He dislikes lying, breaking promises,
   dragons being angry at him,
   and being yelled at.

   Blue often imagines himself as other dragons, and he constantly wonders about what they desire, what they worry about and hope for, and why some dragons seem unhappy. He thinks that most of his guesses are probably wrong,
   but other dragons' lives draw him like a moth to a flame.
   He has faith in other dragons,
   and it would be difficult for him to care about himself more than everybody else.
   When forced by Wasp's mind-control to stand guard over his fellow SilkWings, he would often cry.

      Blue was first shown in his home during the night, busy thinking about his half-sister, Luna, and her upcoming Metamorphosis. After Luna stirred him and said goodbye to her mother,
      Silverspot
      , they went to Luna's favorite places to celebrate her last day as a dragonet. Before they could enter the shopping plaza, Blue and Luna were checked in by a HiveWing guard named
      Hawker
      , who examined their IDs and palm carvings before letting them through. After three more checkpoints, Blue and Luna finally entered the plaza, where they went into a candy store named
      The Sugar Dream
      . However, the HiveWing salesdragon,
      Chafer
      , refused to serve them until
      Scarab
      had been checked out. Two more HiveWings then entered the shop, rudely commenting on Chafer's "interesting new customers."
      Weevil
      , one of the HiveWings, asked to touch Luna's wing buds. When she refused, Blue quickly explained that it was better not to touch them right before Metamorphosis — a lie because he did not want Luna to get in trouble — and offered to let the HiveWing touch his own. After Weevil poked them, Lady Scarab asked Weevil to help her pick up some candy so that he would leave Blue alone. However, Weevil's friend smugly requested an extra-complicated order of eight honey drops, six sugar wasps, and one box of apricot taffy.
      <p key="755ee468-3b0c-4d60-acb6-2b9595fe48ae">
       After Weevil and his friend left the store, Chafer still refused to serve them on Scarab's behalf. Scarab insisted on Chafer serving the SilkWings immediately, and when he refused, she used her HiveWing powers to create a foul-smelling odor. Chafer hurriedly gave them their two honey drops, and Luna dropped two scales on the counter as payment. Before they left, Lady Scarab told them that they should visit a friendlier store towards SilkWings next time.

      <p key="f88dd37b-2bf1-429c-9868-946269accbcb">
       After that, Blue and Luna visited the
       Mosaic Garden
       . There, Luna complained about her silk glands, which were glowing a strong orange color, hurting. Luna told Blue that they needed to leave, and they went to the
       Cocoon
       immediately, where they met with Burnet,
       Io
       , and
       <a href="Swordtail.html" key="8ff7bd74-4f05-4c89-99d7-8950c830c84e" title="Swordtail">
        Swordtail
       </a>
       , as well as at least five HiveWing guards. As Luna began her Metamorphosis, flamesilk spilled from her wrists, and the guards surrounded her. Swordtail began fighting the guards while Io ordered Blue to run. She told him that he had to stop trusting the HiveWings if he wanted to remain free and that he had to go somewhere he would not be found; if Luna turned out to be a flamesilk, then Queen Wasp would probably want Blue locked up in case he was one as well.
      </p>
      <p key="148358ed-1586-4b46-9170-e59114e87da8">
       When Blue and Io stopped at the edge of the Cocoon's outer courtyard, Io threw Blue up into the air. Flinging Blue up toward the last level of the Hive, they both ran across the Hive's treestuff. Io told Blue to find a group of rebel SilkWings called the
       Chrysalis
       ; they would help Blue if he could find them. They ran until they reached an upper-class
       HiveWing school
       , which bordered a park filled with HiveWing families. Blue and Io posed as humble SilkWing servants and went unnoticed until Queen Wasp mind-controlled her tribe, putting them under orders to find and capture Blue. Blue and Io fled for the exit, where two HiveWings confronted Io. She knocked a ladder between her and the guards and shot a strand of silk from her wrists for Blue to swing from. He managed to escape the attacking HiveWings, running towards the end of the courtyard, where he was rescued by talons ushering him inside a supply shed.
      </p>
      <p key="9c00c852-de5c-4414-8884-6d8e4d87dae9">
       His rescuer led him into a series of tunnels located under the HiveWing school, and they emerged into a small library. There, Blue realized that she was a HiveWing. She introduced herself as Cricket, explaining that she could not be mind-controlled like the rest of her tribe for an unknown reason.
      </p>
      <p key="c8851085-fed7-40eb-8e33-c0d631a957f1">
       While they were talking, Blue felt a sharp prickle from under his armband. As he started to feel woozy and his words started to slur, Cricket explained that there were probably toxic-inducing barbs under his band, installed for precisely this type of situation to make him easier to capture. Cricket took one of the lamps from the library walls, breaking the glass ball inside to reveal a small piece of glowing flamesilk. Using a pair of tweezers, she used the strand of flamesilk to burn off Blue's armband. That was when Blue lost consciousness on the table, waking to Cricket's voice urging him to get up. Just in time, he and Cricket hid in the tunnel's trapdoor. A moment later, three brainwashed HiveWings checked the library for Blue, and after they left, Blue and Cricket crept out from the trapdoor again.
      </p>
      <p key="bccb3c7a-b85e-45ff-8697-17ffb6de5f8f">
       Cricket pulled a book from one of the shelves, which contained a page that explained flamesilk genetics. According to the book, a SilkWing dragonet with one flamesilk parent had a fifty percent chance of being one themselves, meaning that Blue may have been one himself. When Blue told Cricket about his half-sister Luna and how she was in danger, she agreed to help him rescue her. In the librarian's desk, they found forms about flamesilk orders, which all traced back to a warehouse located in
       Wasp Hive
       . Before they could travel there, they needed to rescue Swordtail from
       Misbehaver's Way
       .
      </p>
      <p key="776da67f-ea0f-4e84-912e-53437bcc8aae">
       As they continued through the HiveWing school, Cricket took Blue into a room full of small terrariums. There, Blue was surprised to see a tree growing in the middle of Cricket's terrarium. Cricket explained that she had found the seed on one of her school's gathering field trips and that she had not known it was a tree until it started growing. Next, they entered a room entitled
       <i key="c2a796dc-6dba-409b-9c19-6496b1163132">
        Chemistry
       </i>
       . This room was connected to an art gallery, where Cricket painted Blue's scales in dark blue, brown, and red colors, disguising the vibrant blues and purples. Once they had reached the exit door, Blue went first to make sure it was safe; he was only confronted by one working HiveWing, who told him that it was probably best to get back to his cell since the
       <a class="mw-redirect" href="Queen.html" key="fb7ab621-8d90-4530-87db-6b73b2bd4980" title="Queen">
        queen
       </a>
       was going to send out the search parties for the missing SilkWing as soon as dawn arrived the next day. Blue nodded to him and beckoned for Cricket to join him after the HiveWing had left.
      </p>
      <p key="394104e4-98d0-43c5-bde4-b8f974dcb0ae">
       After walking through the park, Cricket pushed open a gate that bordered the courtyard, emerging onto a path that led to Misbehaver's Way's pedestals. There, the displayed dragons stood frozen. After burning off Swordtail's wrist cuff, Cricket then unrolled a pouch of vials from her satchel, selecting one with a green liquid inside and placing the flamesilk from the library into the bottle so that the substance started to bubble and steam. Holding it under Swordtail's nose, the SilkWing woke up with a lot more strength and speed than usual. After smashing straight through one of the treestuff walls and throwing rocks around, Swordtail wrapped Blue's chest in silk, scooped him up, and disappeared into the night with Cricket close behind.
      </p>
      <p key="c0cd11c0-c34e-47aa-b9fb-7dc560d85591">
       After a full night of flying, Blue noticed a massive divot in the savanna, where they descended. Once they reached the divot's bottom, they found a tunnel that led away from the main cavern and deeper into the ground. Following Cricket, Blue was greeted by a small pool, on which rested a boat and a rope that lead to the surface. Cricket lead the way deeper into the tunnel, where she found a scavenger. He was sitting near a fire, reading a book, but he fled after seeing the dragonets approaching him.
      </p>
      <p key="d9e7555d-e22f-4d2d-9337-bde7b88c8d87">
       Swordtail then fell asleep near the fire, and Cricket offered to keep watch while Blue slept as well, but Blue let Cricket rest while he kept watching instead. When Cricket woke up, it was nighttime again, and the three made plans to travel to Wasp Hive by morning. When Swordtail tried to pick up Blue again, he found that his former strength had worn off, and he ended up wrapping Blue's chest in thick silk so that he could climb up the divot's walls without danger of falling. Once Blue finally heaved himself over the divot's lip, he and Cricket found a small cave. There, with Cricket curled beside him, Blue eventually fell into a much-needed sleep. When he awoke, voices were coming from outside of their hiding place. Blue and Cricket listened to a conversation between two HiveWings, and how they both thought it was a waste of time to put all of this effort into finding one troublesome SilkWing. They crept across the savannah toward Wasp Hive after sleeping a little more, keeping low in the grassland.
      </p>
      <p key="65813c4a-8fdb-492a-ae16-6a648cb26565">
       Once they had reached Wasp Hive's outskirts, the group saw several rows of enormous greenhouses, one of which was hung with a sign that declared:
       <b key="d4a2c09c-8f29-4f87-a62b-1252cc4b03d9">
        DO NOT ENTER, BY ORDER OF QUEEN WASP. PROPERTY OF THE QUEEN. TRESPASSING PUNISHABLE BY DISMEMBERMENT, MAIMING, IMPALING, AND DEATH, IN THAT ORDER.
       </b>
       It was also barred by several thick layers of silk. Once Blue and the others managed to enter the greenhouse, Swordtail rebuilt the door with his silk, but all three of them were quickly captured by three LeafWings who had been hiding inside the greenhouse. There,
       Belladonna
       ,
       Hemlock
       , and
       <a href="Sundew.html" key="75d6101e-c9a9-4ec1-a9bf-9038c8c0d3a6" title="Sundew">
        Sundew
       </a>
       offered them a deal: help them steal the
       Book of Clearsight
       , or die. While Swordtail was willing to help, Cricket was not. After a bit of discussion, interspersed with Sundew yelling at them, they decided to "help" the LeafWings, agreeing in front of them and hoping to escape in secret later.
      </p>
      <p key="fe7c7c4f-8b8b-4814-90a6-f8ba3c2e7040">
       However, this plan was quickly overturned, as Sundew went with Blue and Cricket to the
       Temple of Clearsight
       . They managed to reach the temple undiscovered but were attacked by the
       Librarian
       , who had been permanently mind-controlled by Wasp ever since accepting her job. After Sundew attacked the Librarian, she accidentally dropped the key for the case protecting the Book of Clearsight, and Blue used it to open the case and take the book. Using a pair of bullet ants, Sundew forced Wasp to leave the Librarian's mind for the first time in years. Cricket and the Librarian then carried Blue towards the exit using a rope, but Wasp infiltrated the Librarian's mind once again and forced her to drop the rope. Blue threw the Book of Clearsight to Cricket, forcing her to drop the rope as well and leave Blue to the mercy of the HiveWings.

       Blue was then taken to
       the flamesilk factory
       , where he met his father, Admiral, for the first time along with several other flamesilks as well as Luna's cocoon. As he explored the cave, Blue found a small hole through which Sundew contacted him, explaining her escape plan. Blue told her to delay it until Luna had metamorphosed, which the LeafWing reluctantly agreed to. His first night in the factory, he had a nightmare about the flamesilks arguing in a never-ending series of hallways in Cricket's school. The morning after, he watched Luna emerge from her cocoon and told her and his father about the escape plan. After Admiral attempted to call the guards to stop his children from escaping, Blue decided that he did not want to be like him.
       Danaid
       declined an offer to come with them. Blue and Luna escaped the factory by using Sundew's leafspeak.

      Along with Swordtail, they emerged from the LeafWing tunnels near
      Dragonfly Bay
      , where HiveWings eventually ambushed them. As he was close to his metamorphosis, Blue and Cricket hid in the cave system, and Cricket promised to stay by his side during the metamorphosis.

      as he emerged from his cocoon. After Swordtail told Blue that Luna still had not been found, the group agreed to travel to
      Jewel Hive
      in hopes of contacting the Chrysalis. They landed on the top of a cliff a distance away from the Hive, and Swordtail explained that to communicate with the Chrysalis, they needed to leave them a message near a central feature — the
      Glitterbazaar
      — in Jewel Hive. They spent the night in the back corner of a curtain shop, and after Blue and Swordtail were awoken by Sundew, the group moved to another stall and disguised themselves in extravagant capes and scarves to blend in with the typical dragons of Jewel Hive. Despite Sundew's disapproval, he left a strand of flamesilk in the shop's lantern to pay for their items. They then went to a nearby jewelry stall, where they added necklaces, headdresses, and other adornments to their disguises. Again, Blue left three coils of flamesilk in a small stone vase before they left.

       Blue and the others followed Cricket to
       Dragonfly Square
       , where they hid inside a water tower until it was dark. Cricket noticed
       Katydid
       sneaking into
       Cadelle
       's house, with another hooded dragon watching from the avenue's corner. Despite Sundew and Swordtail's protests, Cricket snuck away from the water tower and entered Cadelle's house as well, where she met Katydid. After speaking with her, Cricket returned to the water tower, where she lay curled beside Blue while they talked about the mystery of Cricket's birth parents. Near midnight, the group went to Jewel Hive's library, where Cricket found the key to the library hidden on a statue of Clearsight, beneath her fifth neck spine. Cricket unlocked the doors and returned the key to its hiding place. After the group entered the library, Sundew heard three arguing voices from the library's second level, and they all climbed the stairs to investigate. Swordtail then introduced himself to the three arguing SilkWings,
       Cinnabar
       ,
       Morpho
       , and
       Tau
       , explaining that he and his friends needed their help. After the SilkWings asked who Swordtail's friends were, Blue, Cricket, and Sundew revealed themselves as well. Morpho, Sundew, and Swordtail agreed that most of the HiveWings needed to be destroyed to free the SilkWings and save the LeafWings, but Blue, Cinnabar, Cricket, and Tau seemed to want a more peaceful solution. During their conversation, Cricket saw a pair of HiveWing guards fly past the library. She warned the others, and they hid in the library's book drop columns.

       After the guards and one HiveWing under Queen Wasp's mind control entered the library, Wasp ordered her guards to find the dragons they saw through the window. When their search was unsuccessful, Wasp demanded that the guards build a bonfire of books in the middle of the library in hopes of smoking the dragons out of hiding. Cinnabar and Tau then revealed themselves and told the queen that they had been sneaking into the library by night to avoid their work. Wasp told one of her guards to take Cinnabar and Tau back to
       Jewel
       for punishment but stayed in the library until the other guard reported that Lady Scarab was hiding someone in her mansion. Cricket assumed that the guard was talking about Katydid, and, after the mind-controlled dragon and Wasp's guard had left, Cricket said that she was going to warn her. Blue agreed with Cricket, and after Morpho went home, Blue and the others went into the upper levels of Jewel Hive and joined a party near Scarab's mansion. From the party, everyone watched as a dragon controlled by Wasp and a squad of HiveWing soldiers demanded that Scarab show them the dragon she was hiding inside her mansion. Scarab refused, but eventually, Katydid revealed herself to the HiveWings, and after Wasp took over her mind, she took Katydid away. After watching all this, Cricket decided to ask Lady Scarab if she knew anything about Wasp's mind-control powers. Blue and the others stayed at the party.

       Blue, Cricket, Sundew, and Swordtail were next seen in one of the indoor stalls in the Glitterbazaar. Cricket planned to reveal the truth about the Book of Clearsight finally. Despite Sundew and Swordtail's disapproval, they all copied Clearsight's letter and a few notes from Cricket on several pieces of paper. When they had made well over one hundred copies, Cricket collected them and wished Blue and the others goodbye, explaining that they should hide; she needed to conduct the next part of her plan by herself. While Cricket stayed in the Glitterbazaar to distribute the truth and learn how Wasp's mind-control worked, Blue and Swordtail spent the time searching for Luna, but to no avail. Later, Cricket found her friends in a stall within the outer Glitterbazaar canopy. Blue spoke with Cricket first and then led her inside a stall, where she met with Sundew and Tau. Cricket briefly explained that Wasp inserted a specific type of plant into HiveWing eggs' shells to mind-control them, meaning that Belladonna and Hemlock would not need to kill all of the HiveWings to save the LeafWings and SilkWings. Cricket also rescued an egg from the Nest in Jewel Hive because she guessed that because Wasp had only injected it once, the dragonet inside would not be able to be mind-controlled. Sundew did not think that her parents would care about Cricket's discovery, but she agreed to let her try and convince them anyway.
      </p>
      The next morning, Blue awoke in a cave located in a peninsula northeast of Jewel Hive. Shortly after Blue woke, Cricket's rescued egg hatched. The group decided to name her
      Bumblebee
      for her black-and-yellow scales. Cricket, looking at Bumblebee's eggshell, saw a green residue on the inside. After she and Sundew smelled the substance, Sundew realized that the eggshell smelled identical to the plants in Wasp's secret greenhouse, meaning that the plants were probably the source of Wasp's mind-control ability. Cricket asked Sundew if they could try to destroy Wasp's plant supply, and she agreed, but before they left their cave, Blue saw black smoke to the south. Upon further inspection, Cricket realized that the smoke rose from
      Bloodworm Hive
      . Sundew knew then that Belladonna and Hemlock had conducted the next part of their plan without waiting for Sundew's report. While she was upset about that, the group also saw hundreds of mind-controlled HiveWings flying toward Bloodworm Hive to save it. Sundew knew that since most HiveWings would be assisting Bloodworm Hive, Wasp Hive would be vulnerable, so Blue and the others flew along the south coast of the peninsula until they reached the outskirts of Wasp Hive. After scouting, Sundew shot a sleeping dart at the guard protecting Wasp's greenhouse, and while Swordtail pulled the guard away so that he would not die with the plants, the others sliced open the webs covering the greenhouse opening. Sundew took a small piece of the mind-control plant and put it into one of her pouches before Blue spread his flamesilk around the greenhouse. Blue closed the door just as the greenhouse completely shattered. Cricket ran into the second HiveWing guard while escaping, but convinced him to save his fellow guard and the other greenhouses. They then fled north, following Sundew's lead towards the

      After Bloodworm Hive was set aflame, Blue and company followed Sundew to the Poison Jungle, where the LeafWings have been hiding out since the Tree Wars. After Swordtail nearly gets eaten by a giant Venus dragon-trap, Blue impulsively uses his flamesilk in an attempt to burn the plant and save his friend. This causes a fire to spread, which Sundew puts out. Blue is told that what he did was incredibly unwise (in harsher words). When they reach the village, Blue learns that his silk was used to burn down one of the hives, which upsets him.

       Belladonna mistakenly assumes that he, Swordtail, Cricket, and Bumblebee are Sundew's prisoners. Sundew angrily corrects this, stating that "anyone who hurts a scale on their bodies will find themselves on the wrong end of a bombardier beetle." Blue then remained in the PoisonWing village for the majority of the book.

      He was then seen arguing with Swordtail at the temporary camp when Sundew arrived with the antidote, which she was surprised by as she had never seen Blue argue before. The next morning, after hearing of Sundew's success with the antidote, he lit a large pyre to transmit the cure via smoke, unaware that he was actually burning disguised breath of evil. He was likely taken over by the othermind afterward.

After speaking with his father, Blue realized that Admiral's peaceful, obedient way of trying to change things — sending fruitless letters to Queen Wasp to improve the flamesilks' living and working conditions — was not effective at all, having said many of his letters were dismissed. He tried to reason with Admiral by explaining that the only way to gain freedom was by directly disobeying the queen, but Admiral strongly disagreed. When Blue attempted to escape the factory with Luna, Cricket, Sundew, and Swordtail, Admiral tried to notify the factory's HiveWing guards and betray his son. However, Danaid was willing to help the young dragons by causing a loud distraction that consisted of all of the flamesilks loudly arguing, which consequently drowned out Admiral's warning.

   When Blue initially met Cricket, one of the first things he noticed was how she was willing to talk to him, a SilkWing, as though they could be friends, and she looked at him as if he were a real dragon, and not a wingless curiosity or an annoyance to be stepped over.
   She took a large risk for him by using dangerous flamesilk to burn off his wrist cuff,
   and Blue vowed to do everything he could to keep her out of trouble for helping him.
   Blue lets her smile chase away his nerves,
   and felt a small glow of happiness when he thought of he and Cricket leaving Cicada Hive together.
   When Blue asked why she was so willing to help him, she replied that she found him interesting, and would love to know more about him, and knew how it felt to have to hide when everyone else was under the control of Queen Wasp.
   Cricket makes him feel safe,
   and Blue would go with her anywhere she asked.
   He wants her to be safe,
   and could not imagine his life without her in it.
   Cricket stated that she would want Blue to be her best friend even if she knew every dragon in Pantala,
