   Arctic had silvery,
   polished
   white scales as pale as the moons
   that contained hints of pale blue.
   His piercing blue eyes, like fragments of ice,
   were the color of a cloudless sky.
   His scales looked scuffed,
   and he had a thunderous, glacier-cracking voice,
   as well as a cracking, bitter laugh that sounded like icicles snapping off of a roof.
   He had a light blue diamond earring in his left ear, and a silver narwhal earring in his right.
   His long tongue was blue and forked.

   While he lived in the Ice Kingdom, Arctic felt trapped by the rules of IceWing society.
   He radiated cold, congealing
   resentment and cold anger, with rotten patches
   around the edges.
   Allknowing
   described him to be "seething with darkness."
   His voice was spitting,
   loud, splintery, and jagged.
   He was vengeful,
   grim,
   lost,
   scornful,
   angry,
   bitter,
   cold, and menacing.
   His thoughts were dark, grumbling,
   and venomous.
  </p>
  <p key="a846239e-158a-4af6-96fc-4dedfedaafb4">
   However, he was patient,
   and seemed genuinely concerned for
   Clearsight
   after she suffered from a harsh series of visions.
   He was genuinely afraid of going mad from use of his animus magic,
   as he was worried that he might become evil and hurt Hope.
   According to Darkstalker's soul reader, Arctic's soul was severely damaged, but he was not completely evil.

      In the prologue, Arctic was shown in his room at a diplomat's palace, receiving a message from a noble IceWing he could not remember the name of. He had been studying animus gifts of the past, trying to come up with his own unique gift. After a brief and tense conversation, he remembered that her name was

      and that they were engaged. He was not enthusiastic about this as he thought she was a boring and shallow dragon. They made their way to the balcony while having what was described to be an incredibly boring conversation. On the balcony, they see a NightWing admiring the sunset while trying to keep herself warm. Arctic asked Snowflake to leave, then began a conversation with Foeslayer, the NightWing. He mentioned that he and Snowflake were engaged, but forgot who she was, which Foeslayer used to tease him. The two talked and flirted for a while. Arctic, fully aware that he was breaking almost every IceWing law but already hopelessly in love, enchanted a diamond earring to keep Foeslayer warm. He explained the situation, and Foeslayer is flabbergasted that he would break such an important law for her. The events of

      <p key="c360e28c-48f4-4f35-a026-fc0c5308880d">
       Years later, Arctic is shown discovering Darkstalker's animus powers when Clearsight and Darkstalker are at his house playing with Darkstalker's scroll. There, Clearsight has visions about Arctic and unwillingly tells him this prophecy:
      </p>
      <p key="e055de34-df14-449b-8398-ae00207b82f8">
       <i key="ca4476fb-c82f-42e6-8bae-7d1732a4ca73">

      <p key="8a9c2347-03a3-45d3-bf25-14bb055d2c51">
       This prophecy turns out to be true, as it is his own talons that disembowel himself. He seems to be more worried about animus powers after Clearsight speaks this prophecy.
      </p>
      <p key="37625583-c1bd-4c19-b9db-fc65fb457695">
       Arctic is also mentioned several times later in brief scenes with Darkstalker. During the last part of the book, he tries to go to the Ice Kingdom with his daughter, Whiteout, whom he had enchanted to follow him and to speak normally. Enraged by this, Darkstalker enchanted Arctic to obey his every command.
      </p>
      Darkstalker then brought Arctic back to the Night Kingdom and gathered a crowd, commanding Arctic to tell the NightWings what he had planned to do. Arctic revealed that he would have offered Whiteout's talons in marriage to a royal IceWing to continue the animus bloodline in the tribe. Additionally, he would have given the IceWings a way into the Night Kingdom in exchange for Foeslayer's release. His last words were that he 'should have strangled Darkstalker the moment he hatched.' Upon hearing this, Darkstalker commanded him to cut out his own tongue and then to disembowel himself by cutting open his stomach and spilling out his guts, quickly leading to his inevitable death.

       , arguing over the earring Arctic had gifted Foeslayer. Arctic tries to prevent Foeslayer from being punished. Later, Diamond finds Arctic in his room and asks why he was up so late. Arctic lied, stating that he was worried about his gifting ceremony when he had really just been about to go to a secret meeting with Foeslayer. Diamond states that a true IceWing would not be worried and reminds him of what she wanted him to make. Arctic has a memory of two nights before when he was at a secret meeting with Foeslayer. She had laughed about Diamond's idea of a "gift of vision," stating that it would be much better if it were something that told you what was going to happen whenever you ask, but that he should not make that, as Diamond would likely do terrible things with it.
      <p key="d214c62c-90a6-4f7a-968e-677759139abe">
       In the present, Arctic said he wanted to talk to Diamond about some more potential ideas in the morning. Diamond placed two guards inside Arctic's room to make sure he slept; ergo, he could not meet with Foeslayer. One night later, Foeslayer had been pacing, frustrated with Arctic for not meeting her, when Arctic used his magic to "froze" Foeslayer's mother, phased through a wall, and told Foeslayer that they should run away together, then enchanted Foeslayer's earring to be protected from Diamond's enchantments. Foeslayer insisted that they could not abandon her tribe and mother to be stuck with the IceWings. Arctic reluctantly agreed to go to the Night Kingdom.
      </p>
      Unfreezing Prudence, they made their way out of the Ice Kingdom. As they leave, six IceWing guards come after them, one being someone Arctic knew. The guards shot arrows at Foeslayer, and Arctic enchanted the guards' spears to stop them, not realizing that they would kill them. When Foeslayer breathes fire at her, Arctic caught it with his magic and threw it at Snowflake, badly burning her wings, resulting in
       Snowfox
       shrieking agonizingly about how she was going to kill every last NightWing for what they did to Snowflake. When Foeslayer asked Arctic if his soul felt fine, he responded that it was none of her concern. When Foeslayer stated that it was, Arctic growled at her.

   Arctic resented Darkstalker.
    He often rudely asked his son if any part of him resembled an IceWing,
    and was furious upon Darkstalker's hatching that the dragonet did not resemble him.
    Arctic never looked Darkstalker in the eye, and often glared at him.
    Darkstalker believed that Arctic was the most dangerous dragon within the lost city of night,
    and when Clearsight observed Arctic and Darkstalker interacting, she noted that there were many giant, furious, unspoken thoughts and feelings that were not verbally expressed between them.
    Darkstalker was dangerous, quiet,
    angry, and crueler than necessary towards his father,
    and the only slight liking he had towards Arctic was due to his love for Hope.
    He was suspicious of
    and bothered by Darkstalker's mind-reading abilities, and was jealous of his son's knowledge of Hope's thoughts.
    They often tried to avoid one another as much as possible,
    and Darkstalker was aware of multiple futures where Arctic attempted to kill him.
    Despite his seething hatred towards Darkstalker,
    Arctic refused to kill his own son.

   Diamond constantly yelled at and reminded her son about his duties as an IceWing prince. She was judgmental and regulating towards him, but despite her attempts to control his life, he eventually fled the Ice Kingdom in order to live with Hope.
    Diamond claimed to love Arctic, but was quick to remind him about her disapproval towards his choices.

   When Arctic first met Hope, he found his wings responding in a way that matched her own. Hope laughed and grinned with him, and he found himself unable to stop smiling at her. He thought that perhaps nothing would ever be boring or frustrating again so long as they were together, and he would do anything to spend a few more minutes with her. He broke his animus vow for Hope, and longed for her to view him as a dragon who did not care much for rules. He brushed his wing with her own, and promised her that his soul was hers, if she wanted it.
  </p>
  <p key="171a176f-36aa-4154-afba-c0a0b05d9db3">
   In later stages of their relationship, Arctic threatened Hope after she made a joke towards him,
    and Darkstalker sensed that his mother was in danger.
    There was fury, bitterness,
    suspicion, hatred, and emanating outrage from both partners.
    They often argued
    and squabbled
    loudly,
    and Hope was irritated with Arctic for staying within their home and complaining constantly.
    Although Arctic believed Hope only loved him for his animus magic, in truth, she disliked his magic and wished he had not been an animus. In fact, she stated she loved him more than anything.
  </p>
  <p key="ba9be643-74ab-400e-9dc4-750ff0b33437">
   However, he still loves her; when Darkstalker hatched, he sensed a small, warm ember of love for Hope hidden under layers of ice.
    He could not bear to keep secrets from her,
    and worried about her safety.
    In one of Clearsight's visions, he was crying over a painting of Foeslayer by Whiteout.
    They were still physically affectionate with one another in the later stages of their relationship.

   Although they were arranged to be married, Arctic found Snowflake quite unmemorable, and was worried that she might not have a personality besides repressed fury.

   Whiteout was Arctic's daughter, and, according to Darkstalker, he often acted as though she was his only dragonet.
    He openly preferred her over Darkstalker, most likely because her IceWing genetics were more visible. Although Arctic seems to spend time with Whiteout by taking her on outings and buying her special fish, Darkstalker thinks that Arctic does not really care about her feelings.
    Later in the book, Arctic shows disapproval of her feelings for Thoughtful, most likely because he was a NightWing.
    Arctic also shows little consideration for who his daughter actually is as a dragon, using animus magic to alter Whiteout's personality — making her hate her brother, want to marry an IceWing, and live in the Ice Kingdom even if she would be miserable there.
    He also used his magic to change the way Whiteout spoke so she would sound "normal," revealing a desire for his daughter to be exactly how he wants her to be: a "perfect" dragonet in contrast to Darkstalker.
