   to discover the truth about her father and his lies with
   Daffodil
   and Violet. At a young age she was very curious and was always asking questions, though she knew it "always made her parents frustrated and grumpy with her."
   She is observant, having noticed Heath's lies to the citizens of
   Valor
   at the age of six.
   She is good at picking up on when others are about to get angry, as shown when she could see the lines of tension around
   Brook
   's eyes when talking with Heath, despite the fact that Brook was good at keeping her face expressionless.
   Ivy is a peacekeeper, often between Daffodil and Violet. According to Violet, Ivy never looks like she is about to get into trouble.
   Ivy has artistic talent, much like her aunt.
   She is passionate about her love of

      , a scavenger later revealed to be Ivy, accidentally contacted Sunny using a
      dreamvisitor
      . Sunny assumed that the only way the scavenger could have gotten the dreamvisitor was by stealing it, and so she traveled to the scavenger ruins in hopes that the rest of the
      SandWing treasure
      would be there.
      <p key="079e46ca-0c9f-4dbc-963e-91efe17e4696">
       Upon arrival at the ruins, Sunny climbed onto a tree to survey the area from above and hide until the scavengers came. Eventually, two scavengers emerged from the burnt village — one with short, fluffy hair and a more confident one with longer hair. Sunny approached the scavengers but was forced to trap them on a scavenger building's remains due to them not being cooperative and trying to attack her. She gave Ivy the name Holler because she was very loud, and the other Fluffy because of his fluffy hair.
      </p>
      <p key="c33a95cf-81d4-4cc5-bb5b-a1343ddb6408">
       After Sunny asked for the dreamvisitor, Ivy and
       <a href="Leaf.html" key="f35ee59a-80f1-43d8-8920-fa3811725dc7" title="Leaf">
        Leaf
       </a>
       began to argue, presumably on whether to give it to the
       <a class="mw-redirect" href="Dragonet.html" key="cd7773be-c125-4ee4-bffc-b71a8a4042b9" title="Dragonet">
        dragonet
       </a>
       or not. Eventually, Ivy produced the sapphire and gave it to Sunny. Sunny then asked for the rest of the treasure by drawing a pile of it in the dirt with her claw. After watching the two scavengers discuss it for a while, she decided to take Fluffy off of the wall, assuming that he would bring the treasure in return for Ivy. Ivy then demanded a ride from the dragonet, and so Sunny let her onto her back and flew off in search of Fluffy.
      </p>
      After Leaf gave Sunny a sack full of treasure, Sunny noticed that the
      <a href="Eye of Onyx.html" key="eec1204f-69d2-4141-ae6b-8ee695363d24" title="Eye of Onyx">
       Eye of Onyx
      </a>
      was not in there, although the
      Lazulite Dragon
      was. Sunny questioned the scavengers, but they did not appear to have it. As she was about to leave, Sunny considered keeping Ivy and Leaf as pets but eventually decided against it. Ivy asked Sunny for another ride, but Sunny regretfully told them that she had to leave and flew away with the sack of treasure. Sunny wondered if she would ever see them again.

      Ivy asked her mother,
       Lark
       , about her father's fame. Lark explained how he killed the

       Stone
       was yelling at Heath about running away from dragons before asking Lark if she could have a pet dragon, much to her mother's disapproval. Later, Ivy mentally noted how the women and children created Dragonslayer Way while her father took all the credit. She befriended

       When Violet and Daffodil visited, Lark said she could tell them that Ivy was studying, but Ivy denied, saying she was finished with her homework. Ivy was surprised that the Truth Seekers had lasted for a year since she joined. She expressed her desire to become a

       </a>
       . The three decided to do a Truth Seeker mission instead. Ivy wished she could see a dragon palace, wondering how dragons could be vicious wild animals if they also had castles and lived together, and had queens who ruled over them. Violet asked how Heath could have gone to the

       </a>
       and back in three days, causing Ivy to wonder where he went during the time. Ivy then decided to follow Heath around Valor when he left the caves. She ran into
       <a href="Foxglove.html" key="6e8f8ac4-0a60-4e01-b03c-f1f6ab3e9d9f" title="Foxglove">
        Foxglove

       , and the older Wingwatcher took her outside of the city. They spied on Heath before a

       passes by. Ivy told Foxglove that she loved the dragon, and passionately claimed that she wanted to be a Wingwatcher. Foxglove said she would put in good word for Ivy and took her back underground.

      <p key="94fc3bd7-ec60-4269-9614-4d7e0c34c3b1">
       Five years later, Ivy is surprised and joyed that she is still best friends with Daffodil and Violet, and that they'd all be starting Wingwatcher training together. The trio attended the Wingwatcher welcome ceremony and met Brook, who enthusiastically galloped over and shook each of their hands. Brook states that they are her favorite people, which earned an injured response from her son
       <a href="Forest.html" key="35f123d8-b0fb-4d37-84a9-9c0a6f620dfa" title="Forest">

       </a>
       . When asked about her uncle Stone, Ivy shook her head and remembered that he have always looked sad and that he had disappeared years ago. Meanwhile, more and more Wingwatchers arrive to the cave. Foxglove came over to greet Ivy and her friends, and Ivy shyly gave her a folded drawing of a black dragon in flight to show her gratitude. Foxglove grinned and winked at the initiate, remarking how there have not been a Wingwatcher with artistic talent in years and that they could update the
        Wingwatcher's Guide
        . Violet and Daffodil immediately interjected and asked to be the new authors, while Ivy tells them that they have a lot of research to do before really publishing a new guide. This led to the idea of more expeditions, where they gave suggestions of where they could explore. Foxglove soon hurries away when Violet openly pointed out about
        Pine
        's banishment, and remarked towards Daffodil's hiss that she is just interested in what the older Wingwatchers are talking about, whether there's a secret Wingwatcher conspiracy afoot. Ivy is surprised that they have not told her such thing, but was interrupted by Heath staggering into the cave for an announcement. He complimented on how the Wingwatchers got their hands on the smartest girl in Valor and that they would definitely take care of her out there, which she found an embarrassing to say, especially in public. She continues wondering about the conspiracy and her future as a Wingwatcher, eventually coming back to the thought of if her father should really be the lord of Valor. She wonders if she would have to choose between her friends, her dream, the dragons, and her family.

      <p key="f69fdd6b-5804-4c3f-8ef8-6d547ea012ba">
       During her first year of official training, Ivy goes on a real expedition. Though she, Daffodil, Violet, and Foxglove were only skygazing, she still found it exciting and relaxing. When the other Wingwatchers and fruit gatherers were out of sight, Violet speaks about whether either of them found out anything about the secrets with Stone and the conspiracy. Daffodil and Violet started bickering, but Ivy found that, in the blowing wind and the rustling leaves and dragons somewhere in the sky, even her friends bickering over dangerous conspiracies felt joyful.
After a while, they see their first dragon, who seemed to fly in an odd, loopy way. Ivy wondered if there is something wrong with it, and found it amazing that they met a real ice dragon.
        Squirrel
        rushes in to check in on the trio, but as they shoved through the bushes to examine what had happened, they found Stone in the forest, looking utterly bedraggled. Stone breathed in relief when he saw that they were only Wingwatchers, but told them to keep it secret that he just rode the ice dragon invisible while coming back from his quest of finding Rose. Ivy met Violet and Daffodil's eyes, then looked back at Stone. She asked who Rose is.
      </p>
      <p key="0231e411-137a-4def-abaf-bfb18c75a259">
       The trio arrives at Stone's cave as he told them the story of Rose and what many human settlements used to look like. Ivy is shocked that so much is left out of the glorious story Heath often tells his citizens, which only got worse when Stone states that Heath destroyed the world and he helped Heath do it. Ivy blames herself of her father's mistakes, realizing that he is a liar. Daffodil and Violet tries to comfort her, and tells her that they can instead fix the problem by starting with returning Heath's treasure to the dragons. However, they know that no one had seen a fraction of Heath's treasure in the history of Valor, and therefore they stuck to the most dangerous plan: visiting the forbidden village.
There, they meet the long-lost Pine and
        Azalea
        , who turned out to have lived in the place they were banished in. They ended up finding nothing, realizing that Heath have cleared the ruins of all treasure the first time he found Pine wandering for iron. The six people wandered in the ruins until it started raining and a dragon flew overhead, which is when Ivy felt the only piece of treasure left on the ground: a dreamvisitor.
      </p>
      <p key="1948faa1-c306-43f9-abe9-a166fef4dc9a">
       The Wingwatchers arrived at Stone's cave to examine the dreamvisitor, and narrowly avoided a confrontation with the Dragonslayer. While Heath called Stone away in private, Ivy and her friends talk about continuing to find the treasure. Several days later, she realizes that her father have become slightly paranoid. He cancelled Wingwatcher training that day, and Ivy noticed a difference in her mother's expression, which lead to more suspicions. A while later, Daffodil and Violet arrives to realize that the treasure might be hidden inside the pedestal where Heath keeps Oasis's tail barb. Ivy wondered how she could possibly take this to the dragons.
      </p>
      <p key="0c92d3fb-0708-4d41-a217-c97a8e76c610">
       On a skygazing day, Ivy and her friends suggest ways they could return the treasure to the dragons. Leaf arrives, escaping from the

       </a>
       , and asked for the Dragonslayer's help. Ivy suggests taking him to Heath in person, which however lead to Heath becoming outrageous and thinking that Leaf is another messenger from the
        Invincible Lord
        . The Dragonslayer leaves, leaving Leaf bewildered. Ivy tries to comfort him, but ultimately thinks she communicated everything wrong.
      </p>
      <p key="907470ca-080e-4848-b68d-00621fdb6d91">
       The arrests of the Wingwatchers eventually begun when Ivy was asleep. Daffodil finds a way into Ivy's room, shaking her and crying that Heath have already arrested Foxglove, Squirrel, and Violet. Ivy thinks that he is afraid of the Wingwatchers trying to take his power away, but realizes that he must have found out about the stolen dreamvisitor. Lark arrives, fretting about how she have never seen Heath like that. Ivy tells her to stay out of her father's way, and hugged her fiercely while tugging Daffodil to the door. They took the dreamvisitor hidden in Foxglove's cave, narrowly missing a confrontation with the guards, and escaped the city.
A while later, they meet Leaf, who was also escaping with Stone into the ruins of a former human settlement. The humans are shocked that the dragons have destroyed such city, and Leaf hoped aloud that they could meet the right dragon for returning the treasure. Ivy joked that dragons may eat them before they try to bargain, and closed her eyes at the thought of Leaf actually being in a dragon palace before. They continue wandering through the abandoned settlement for a day, until they meet Forest, who told them that Heath is feeling suspicious of the Wingwatchers planning something similar to a revolution. Ivy is shocked to find out that Daffodil and Violet have never told her how the Wingwatchers have actually planned of choosing a new leader, and tries to think of ways to save her friends from Heath and stop the dragons at the same time. Upon her pondering, she accidentally dreamvisits Sunny, and realizes Rose is alive and well. That comes down to a new plan, a plan of traveling to the desert and saving Rose as a way to change Heath's mind.
After a moment, Sunny arrives in the ruins, looking for the Eye of Onyx as she did in

       . Ivy and Leaf freaks out, desperately giving Sunny the only piece of treasure they have. Leaf offers to get more treasure, and Ivy wonders if he is insane. Though she still eventually wishes him luck, Leaf leaves back to Valor and left Ivy confronting Sunny.
      </p>
      <p key="f900f512-0374-48b1-981b-382e771f1944">
       Ivy asks Sunny where Rose is, but neither understands the other's language. Sunny takes Ivy for a flight, which greatly surprises Ivy and worried Leaf when he came back. Ivy desperately tried communicating to Sunny, shouting that it is an enormous breakthrough for human-dragon relations, but fails ultimately when Sunny leaves, frustrated that she on the other hand is not getting the Eye of Onyx. Ivy is frustrated, but suddenly sees Stone with his invisibility necklace and many horses. They immediately set off for the desert, starting their quest of searching for the long-lost Rose.

       complained to
        Smolder
        , who pointed to a pile of pillows, which turned out to be where Rose is. Rose reunited with Stone, who told her about Heath along with Ivy and Leaf. Rose refuses to come back to Valor, stating that Heath would never listen to reason; however, she also mentions a girl named Wren who taught her
        Dragon
        , which immediately sparked Leaf into action. Before leaving, Ivy is surprised that he is willing to ride a dragon just to save his sister; they had to part ways, and Ivy kissed Leaf. She left with Stone, promising that she would be back.

       Ivy is mentioned much by Leaf throughout his conversations with Wren.

      In the final chapters of the story, Ivy meets Wren and Sky in the ruins of the ancient temple. They formulate a plan to use Sky as a way to force Heath to surrender, freeing the Wingwatchers at the same time. Though Ivy felt bad for her father, she knew it was the best way for him and Valor. She announces Brook as the new lord of Valor, and as Lark asks Ivy to go home with her and Heath, Ivy refuses. She continues traveling with Wren and Leaf, including arriving at Talisman to reveal the dragonmancers' secrets, beginning a new quest on re-building a connection between humans and dragons.

    Ivy and Lark hid in Ivy's room when Heath had broken a few plates in a rage in the kitchen, the both of them pretending not to hear.
