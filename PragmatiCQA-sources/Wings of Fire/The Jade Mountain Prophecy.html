    Anemone
    when she was allied with Darkstalker, or Darkstalker himself. Another reason it could be Anemone is because of the
    ceremony
    , where Turtle makes Anemone a fellow animus. The "fire" could refer to Peril, as she was the one to accidentally release Darkstalker. Yet another interpretation of the "fire" could be that it was referring to Vulture's organization, which had set fires.

   — The lost city needed to be found so the soul reader could be collected and convince Darkstalker he was evil and provide a chance to defeat him in his hesitance. The lost city of night was also necessary to the defeat of Darkstalker due to
    Foeslayer
    turning up there and talking to Qibli (although he did not know he was talking to Darkstalker's mother). Through their exchange, he convinced Foeslayer that her son was too far gone, and this pushed her to aid Kinkajou to put an end to Darkstalker. Also, the lost city was where Kinkajou was, so if they had not gone to get her, Darkstalker would not have turned into
    Peacemaker
    .
