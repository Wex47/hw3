   She smells like sea air and starfish,

   's rule.
   However, when two SeaWing soldiers returned from a nasty battle, she seemed to be most concerned about one soldier's blood staining her pearl-embedded floor instead of his health, only allowing him to see a healer when Tsunami intervened.
   The soldier's brother later stated that she usually would have kept him standing there for the duration of the meeting.
   She also yawned and glanced at her scrolls when a dead dragon was reported to have been found within her kingdom.
   She helped herself to the largest pieces of fish during a Council meeting,
   and was dismissive towards Tsunami's worries about her friends drowning whilst being forced into an easily-flooded cave, stating "Can't they swim?" She also promised Tsunami that if she let anything happen to Auklet's egg, Coral would kill Tsunami as well.
   Herring and Snail feared vicious punishment after allowing Tsunami to take the keys to unchain her friends;
   a resonable concern, considering Coral's punishment of death to several of her citizens that displeased her in some way. She also assigned Webs' wife from kitchen work to active duty after his betrayal, despite the fact that she was caring for a three-year-old dragonet. She also seemed mildly pleased at Webs' devestated reaction.

   Coral also forced her daughter Anemone to grow up connected to her by a rubber harness at all times, and it was only after Auklet was born that Anemone was allowed to roam free for the first time. She cares excessively about her daughters to the point that she rarely remembers any of her sons' names. Coral even once declared that because they could not inherit the throne, they were unimportant, right in front of her son

   Overall, Coral is a kind queen, but tends to be a bit selfish as she tends to care more about her personal interests and loved ones than her tribe as a whole. Coral brutally punishes anyone who threatened to kill her daughters, getting rid of many guards who failed to catch the

   of the heirs. She also appears to be very straight-minded, never stopping to ponder about why many of her guards are failing the job and instead murdering all of them who failed to catch the assassin. This can further be proven when she brutally tortured Tortoise in front of her two-year old daughter, instead of thinking back to how this could negatively impact the young dragonet's mindset.

      , Turtle, and twenty-eight other surviving sons with her now-deceased partner, Gill. Queen Coral was challenged for the throne by Orca when Orca was seven years old, and although Orca nearly won, Coral eventually killed her by impaling her with the narwhal horn attached to the end of her tail. However, before challenging her mother, Orca carved and enchanted a statue of herself that was cursed to kill any of the queen's female dragonets, likely in order to rid herself of potential rivals for the throne. Since Orca's statue was mounted in the Royal Hatchery, it had easy access to its unhatched victims, and after Orca's death, all of Coral's unhatched daughters would be found dead, their eggshells smashed.
Queen Coral is extremely fond of writing and is the author of countless scrolls, likely using writing as a method to cope with the loss of her husband and daughters. She is the author of

       After they swim back to the Summer Palace, Queen Coral goes to a war meeting on the Council level. Afterward, Queen Coral comes and takes Tsunami to a room where they, including Anemone, can sleep. The next morning while the queen is still asleep, Anemone talks to Tsunami, but soon they have to end their talk because the queen is waking up. After she fully wakes up, they go to the Council level. She gets into the "QUEEN" pool with Anemone, and some other dragons come with food. The queen finally notices that Tsunami does not have a pool, and tells her to enter the pool labeled "DRAGONET CARE" because the dragon that was supposed to be there was absent. When Tsunami eats an octopus tentacle without noticing no one else has started eating yet (because Queen Coral did not give permission), Queen Coral comments that since she was "raised by barbarians," she could not know any better, offending Tsunami. After a while, the queen tells

When Princess Moray comments that Queen Coral's scrolls are "the most important subject [the dragonets at school] study," Tsunami is surprised and asks if that is more important than learning how to fight the war. Coral replies, wounded, that her writing is about everything. The queen then tells Whirlpool to give Tsunami lessons in Aquatic.

She suggests that someone look at their injuries, so Queen Coral talks with them a little more and then tells them to go. The conversation turns to Gill and the Sky Kingdom, and the Council wonders what might have happened in the Sky Kingdom. Tsunami says that that might have been caused by her and the dragonets, and when Coral asks her about Gill, Tsunami remembers that she killed him, and says that he died in the arena. Coral tells her that Gill was Tsunami's father, and dismisses the council, saying that "[she] must grieve."

       Whirlpool takes Tsunami for a terribly taught Aquatic lesson, which Tsunami leaves before it is finished. She reunites with Riptide, who teaches her some Aquatic better than Whirlpool. Then, while going back to Queen Coral, she is mysteriously attacked, her head stuffed in a sack while being attacked with viscous swipes and kicks. After escaping, Tsunami got back to Coral on the library level where she was talking about Gill, and Tsunami tells Coral that someone had just tried to kill her. Queen Coral says that they must protect her eggs, and when they reach the Deep Palace, Coral realizes that one of her eggs is broken. She tortures and kills Tortoise, the hatchery's guard, for not protecting the eggs well. Tsunami decides to protect the last remaining egg (Auklet's egg). Queen Coral asks Tsunami what she is doing, because what if she fails, she will be dead too, and claims the egg will be safe in the hatchery if she puts all her guards on it.

       Queen Coral then tells the two princesses what she did to have Anemone's egg hatch, how she had to leave the Kingdom to King Gill and why he was lost to the war. But then, Tsunami suddenly realizes that the cave her friends are in might be flooded from the rain. She goes off with the egg in a harness and Queen Coral is not seen again until after Tsunami frees her friends and goes to sleep in a high, dry cave with them and Sunny protecting the egg. Then they realize that Blister was there, and Blister tells Queen Coral where the dragonets are. At breakfast, Tsunami loudly tells Queen Coral how her friends were treated, and Queen Coral seems surprised, but also seems to secretly be grinding her teeth as well. She sends Lagoon and Shark to the dungeons temporarily as punishment. Later at breakfast, she tells Blister about finding Kestrel's body (although she still does not know who the SkyWing was) and Sunny recognizes the description as Kestrel, blurting "That sounds like Kestrel!" and forcing Tsunami to uncover what she knew. Coral asks Tsunami why she did not tell her, and Blister "covers" for her, presumably to gain Tsunami and the rest of the dragonets' trust.

      <p key="1fd66b45-adea-4521-becf-e62f502cea07">
       Then Queen Coral, Whirlpool, and Anemone go off with Tsunami to show Blister how their secret weapon to end the war is coming along, in which Tsunami realizes that Anemone is an

       . In the demonstration, Whirlpool orders Anemone to control a pearl necklace. After asking her to stop, she enchants the necklace to flow away from Whirlpool and later to explode. But a rustle of leaves then catches the attention of Blister, provoking her to fly up to the canopy of leaves, and then ripping in, wrecking the canopy. They discover that the intruder is Webs. Clay and Tsunami catch him as he's falling in midair and was splashed with seawater after he blacked out. Queen Coral orders anyone else lurking around suspiciously to be brought to them. Riptide was apparently found wandering near the palace in which then provoked Queen Coral to be persuaded and groomed by Blister that those two were working with each other and that they were the egg killers in the royal hatchery. Webs, having a fine for fleeing the war, and stealing Tsunami's egg was sent to prison with Riptide.

       Tsunami decides to go back to the hatchery to keep Auklet's egg warm, vowing to keep it protected no matter what the danger. Later that night, Orca's statue attacks Tsunami. Tsunami defeats Orca's statue after a struggle by pinning it down with a narwhal horn and tells Queen Coral what happened. Queen Coral is mentioned to have smashed it to bits after Anemone uses her magic to uncover the name of the dragon who enchanted it, revealing Orca. She is present when Tsunami names Auklet.
      </p>
      Then Queen Coral decides that the dragonets should go into the dungeons, convinced that it is for their own good with Blister influencing her decision. Anemone comes to visit and enchanted a spear to bring the dragon who tried to kill Tsunami, turning out to be Whirlpool. Anemone shoved him into the water all around them, containing an electrical current due to electric eels. Starflight explains that the eels should have time to recharge their electricity. Tsunami runs through the deactivated prison and frees her friends. Right after the dragonets escape their cell, the Summer Palace is attacked by the SkyWings and MudWings. She is seen to be throwing her scrolls into the water to keep them from burning and sending deadly smoke up. Anemone helps her, and Coral touches her head fondly. Queen Coral is not seen for the rest of the book.

       After returning from a meeting with Blister in the Summer Palace, Queen Coral realized that two more of her daughters had been killed during her time away. Gill tried to apologize, but Coral did not respond. After Gill scolded Turtle for failing to find Snapper in time to save Abalone and his sisters, Queen Coral reminded him that Turtle was only a prince and that Gill should not have expected so much of him, mentioning later that she had already ordered Abalone and Snapper to be executed for failing to successfully guard her daughters. Coral told Gill that their next daughter was going to live, and she was going to stay by her dragonet's side for as long as she needed to. Gill agreed to temporarily take her place as ruler over the Kingdom of the Sea while she raised their next daughter.

      When Turtle later visited Queen Coral to apologize about being unable to find Snapper, she tells him that Auklet is perfect, and told him that Snapper had been in the Summer Palace, and not the Deep Palace like she was supposed to be and that it was not his fault that the two princesses died. She later asks his name and after he tells her, she says that she will remember it this time, and wraps him in a hug. Later, a messenger comes and she bids Turtle farewell before leaving.

   Queen Coral does not trust Riptide as his father, Webs, was a traitor. She later threw Riptide and Webs in prison, although Riptide escaped. After that, he fought for the SeaWings in the battle of the Summer Palace. Queen Coral then said he could escape with his life, but not travel into the Kingdom of the Sea ever again.

   Before Tsunami found Queen Coral, Coral had written a scroll titled "The Missing Princess" about their happy reunion. When Coral and Tsunami met for the first time at the Summer Palace, they embraced and Queen Coral vowed to always watch and protect her daughter. For example, she wanted to put a "harness" on Tsunami which Tsunami declines. Their first point of friction was when Coral ordered Tsunami's friends, the dragonets of destiny, to be chained and starved. When Queen Coral killed one of the dragons guarding the Royal Hatchery for neglecting her duties under Commander Shark's permission, Tsunami began to doubt her mother's leadership. For most of

  <p key="20cebb8e-49e4-4a02-bd17-92c07639c960">
   Because Princess Tsunami volunteered to protect Coral's egg - even if failure meant Coral killing her, their relationship was already beginning to crumble. Blister managed to convince Coral to imprison Tsunami "for her safety," and Coral finally agreed. Tsunami escaped shortly after. Queen Coral's feelings on this are unknown.

   Overall, it is shown that Queen Coral loves Tsunami, and cares for her very much, to the point that she will be extremely overprotective. Upon first meeting Tsunami, Coral cuddled her close and was gentle towards her.
    Coral loves her,
    and kept patting her, as if to make sure she was real, after Tsunami returned to the Kingdom of the Sea.
    However, Coral intentionally belitted Tsunami during a Council meeting
