   He is large,

      . Webs quickly became infamous for his treachery throughout the SeaWing tribe and consequently created an unfortunate situation for his son Riptide, who was also unfairly believed to be a traitor at heart because of his father's crimes. Queen Coral in particular hated the young SeaWing, and assigned him to the lowest of duties: guarding the border of SeaWing territory, as far away from the palaces and SeaWing civilization as possible. Despite the bad rumors, Riptide always wanted to know his father and eventually joined the Talons of Peace in hopes of seeing Webs again. The Talons would only ever tell Riptide that his father was safe, even though Riptide passed them important information about the SeaWings for years, likely ending when the war did.

      Riptide first appeared on patrol duty in the Kingdom of the Sea. After he briefly spoke with
       Nautilus
       in Aquatic, Tsunami revealed herself to Riptide and he fled, but accidentally smacked into the side of a passing whale. After she pinned him down, Riptide flashed his scales at Tsunami, saying something in Aquatic, and Tsunami responded by flashing some of her scales. Then, Riptide lunged at her and Tsunami, thinking that Riptide was trying to attack her, swam to the surface after slashing her claws across his snout. It was then revealed that when Tsunami flashed her scales to show Riptide she was also a SeaWing, she had unknowingly flashed that she liked him in Aquatic, saying: "Hey, sparkling teeth, I totally love three of your claws but not the others, and I wish your snout was a herring so I could eat it, and also your wings sound like sharks snoring." After learning about her inability to speak and understand Aquatic, he became suspicious, but noticed Tsunami's sad expression and assumed that she was not lying about being a real SeaWing. Clay flew over, but Riptide, attempting to protect Tsunami from Clay, threw Tsunami down into the water, which Clay thought was hostile. After seeing Clay, he attacked him (as

        Summer Palace
        as Tsunami pointed out what her mother's reaction would be if he did not bring her back. They were confronted by the advance guard, although Tsunami eventually convinced
        Shark
        to let them through. After they entered the tunnel that led to the palace, Riptide removed Clay and Sunny's blindfolds and led them forward with glowing scales. After their arrival, Riptide told Tsunami a summary of the palace's architecture and history and took the dragonets of destiny to the top pavilion, where they could wait for Queen Coral to return from the Deep Palace. After Queen Coral and
        Anemone
        arrived, Riptide went back to guard duty under the queen's annoyed orders.

       Later, as Tsunami was resting outside the Summer Palace in a cave near the sea, Riptide approached her. Riptide expressed that he'd like Tsunami to tell him about Webs, and although Tsunami listed several good things about her former guardian, Riptide asked to hear about his father's flaws as well, insisting that it'd be okay. Riptide also taught Tsunami a small portion of Aquatic, including the phrases 'squid-brain' and 'I will protect,' as well as how to indicate different types of danger. After Tsunami realized her friends may be in danger from Shark and his guards, she quickly left for the Summer Palace.

       The following day, Webs had been found at the Summer Palace and Coral decided she wanted to execute him for his crimes. Soon after, Riptide was found sneaking around outside the palace as well. Coral accused Riptide of working with his father and threw them both in prison, despite Tsunami's protests. With the help of

       , Coral was convinced that Webs was the assassin that had been killing off her heirs for years, and she wanted her last egg (which was being guarded by Tsunami) to be put back into the royal hatchery. However, Tsunami was convinced that Webs was not the assassin, and the egg was still in danger. She made a deal that if she caught the assassin, she had to let Riptide go. Queen Coral, thinking that she already had the assassins, agreed.

      Later, Blister tricked Queen Coral into putting the dragonets in her prison, where Riptide and Webs were as well. Anemone, Tsunami's younger sister, slipped away from her mother and freed the dragonets. The dragonets then released Riptide and Webs from their cage and then prepared to leave. Riptide then revealed to Tsunami that he had joined the Talons of Peace to learn more about his father, though they told him nothing. Tsunami was mad at Riptide for lying to her, but at the same moment, the SeaWing palace was attacked by the SkyWings and the MudWings, who had followed Webs to the Summer Palace. The dragonets and Webs escaped, but Riptide stayed to fight against

   Riptide is supportive of Tsunami,
    and he is physically affectionate towards her.
    Riptide's whole face lit up when Tsunami was mentioned, and
    Moonwatcher
    said that Tsunami thinks of Riptide all the time, and wants to hear from him.
    Riptide is supportive of Tsunami,
    and he is physically affectionate towards her.
    She makes him nervous,
    but she genuinely likes him,
    and hoped to see him again after their initial meeting.
    She likes having him around her,
    and although her first instinct was to yell at him for lying about the identity of his father,
    he looks at her without any expectation of her becoming queen or any judgement about her murder of
   <a href="Gill.html" key="02e37cf0-49b7-4690-9f79-20529561297c" title="Gill">
    Gill
   </a>
   ; he only sees her as a dragon whom he likes very much.
    After she reassured him physically, Tsunami felt something tingle in the air between them.
    He helped her to forget about Gill's death for a while, and he took her front talons in his before they parted. He told her to be careful and that he would be close, if she needed him.
    Tsunami considered him to be someone that she could trust,
    but after discovering that he had lied to her about his affiliation with the Talons of Peace, her trust was broken in him, and she wondered if she could believe anything he said.
    After he apologized to her, she was unsure about her forgiveness towards her, but she still wanted a chance to decide. She wanted him to survive the War of SandWing Succession, and she wanted to meet him again after it was over.
    They are currently in a long-distance relationship.
