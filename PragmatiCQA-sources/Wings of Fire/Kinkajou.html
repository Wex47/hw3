      when she was knocked unconscious
      and brought through the animus-touched
      NightWing tunnels
      to the Night Kingdom. Kinkajou's venom was so weak that the NightWings did not even bother binding her snout shut. She claimed that she was the youngest dragon there and confirmed that there had been seventeen missing, three of which were already dead. When the NightWings were coming after them during their escape, Glory asked Kinkajou to camouflage herself to look like a NightWing dragonet. Kinkajou fooled the guards for long enough so that she could escape. With her help (and

      's example.
Kinkajou participated in the venom contest during Glory's
      challenge
      for the RainWing throne and proved to be exceptionally better than what
      Bromeliad
      had claimed. During
      Grandeur
      's turn, a sloth tumbled out of the trees and landed in front of the targeting board. When Kinkajou leaped to move it away, Grandeur's venom accidentally hit the young RainWing's wing, causing the venom to start burning through her wings. Kinkajou started to scream, her scales turning white and green. The venom, in three spots, began eating away at Kinkajou's wing. Due to her
      panicking, she fainted. After a quick and panicked venom test with Grandeur, Glory put some of her venom on Kinkajou's affected wing in an attempt to stop the venom from eating through her scales. It proved successful. Grandeur forfeited, realizing that Glory should be the rightful queen, especially because Glory was related to Grandeur. Kinkajou thereby was awarded the victory for the venom targeting, and Glory became the new queen of the RainWings.

      Kinkajou was woken up by
       Anemone
       , who was casting a spell on her with Turtle. Anemone enchanted Kinkajou's skyfire to heal her and later added a spell to "make her love Turtle as much as he loved her." Turtle hated this but could not change the spell because it had already been cast, and he thought it might risk hurting Kinkajou. The healing spell erased Kinkajou's three venom scars, and she seemed a bit disappointed that since she claims it made her look tough. Turtle secretly enchanted the skyfire at the same time to protect her from any spells by

      . Darkstalker would also not notice her, not be able to read her mind, and regard her as unimportant if he ever spotted her or if she was in any of his futures. Soon after she was woken up, Darkstalker showed up. He created a prison for the dragons coming to kill Glory, and Kinkajou did not think that was good. As soon as he left, Kinkajou told Turtle, "He's definitely evil." Turtle told her his suspicions of how evil Darkstalker was, and she agreed to help him spy on Darkstalker. When Darkstalker left with the dragons who wanted to come with him to the
       old Night Kingdom
       , Kinkajou followed him, along with Turtle. When they got there, Moonwatcher was attacked by the mop Anemone enchanted to hit her until she was done cleaning Anemone's room for her, and that she would not be done until Anemone told her that it was done. Kinkajou told Anemone to stop and called her an "overripe melon" and a "jackdaw." She said she was being a horrible dragon and told her to stop using her magic for bad things. Then Darkstalker came in. He put Moon under a trance, and Turtle signaled to Kinkajou for her to pretend she was under the trance, too. Then, after Anemone was told to leave and she did, Moon came out of the trance, and Kinkajou pretended to as well. Turtle had to go after Anemone. Kinkajou flared her wings, turning them pink at the edges, and gave him a sweet smile. After that, she left the room with Darkstalker and Moon.
Later, Kinkajou was brought to Darkstalker's throne room by a sword that he enchanted to find someone the hidden animus dragon (Turtle) cared about. She told Turtle not to mind her and stay hidden, but he refused and gave his enchanted hiding stick to Anemone. Darkstalker then tried to kill Turtle, but Kinkajou melted his eyeball, hindering him temporarily, though it is possible she only did this due to Anemone's love spell. Turtle then quickly gave Kinkajou his pouch of animus objects, and Kinkajou was sent out of the room as Darkstalker took Turtle's animus powers. Darkstalker tried to enchant her to forget about everything that happened, but it did not work because of the spell Turtle put on her, though she pretended to leave under Darkstalker's spell. Turtle, while being brought to the dungeon, thought of her when he thought of the dragons that could still save him and the world.

Once seeing Chameleon change into his NightWing form, Shapeshifter, she noticed that Shapeshifter still had the same jewelry as Bog, but she then noticed that he was wearing another earring, and Kinkajou guessed that the scroll pieces were in it. They devised a plan to steal Chameleon's pieces of Darkstalker's scroll. Qibli acted as a distraction, and Kinkajou managed to camouflage and steal the earring, reverting Chameleon to his original lime-green RainWing state. They persuaded him to go back to the Rainforest Kingdom.

    . She proved to be fierce and helpful while helping Glory escape the Night Kingdom, though she hit a NightWing with the blunt end of a spear. She views Glory as a role model, and it is shown that Queen Glory thinks of Kinkajou as a friend rather than a subject.
    She also did not hesitate to find a blood relative to Ex-Queen Grandeur to save Kinkajou from an accidental venom strike. She is one of Kinkajou's closest friends, and Kinkajou thinks of her as her "awesome queen." She is fiercely loyal to her, attacking Icicle when Icicle was plotting to murder Glory. She also sometimes brags about having Glory as a friend.
    She is one of Glory's favorite subjects,
    and Kinkajou considers herself to be Glory's best friend.

   Moon and Kinkajou are very close friends, and they get along pretty well, as shown several times in the second arc. Kinkajou also tends to think Moon likes other dragons better than her. She treats Moonwatcher like a best friend.
    Kinkajou used to hold a slight grudge against her since she was a NightWing, but after Moon told her about
    Secretkeeper
    hiding her egg in the rainforest, they have been best friends ever since. In

   Kinkajou and Tamarin are good friends. Kinkajou does not dwell on her blindness, and when telling someone about Tamarin, it is not the first thing she says. Kinkajou has a strong belief in Tamarin's abilities, as shown during the flower hunt portion of the RainWing Royal Challenge.

Anemone's spell enchanted Kinkajou to believe that Turtle was handsome, brave, and noble, but Kinkajou was aware that these feelings were a result of the spell and was quite angry towards Anemone and towards herself.
    Turtle has an enormous crush on her,
    and after not mentioning the spell for about a month after Anemone released Kinkajou from it, Turtle admitted that he still had feelings for her.
    Kinkajou likes him too, but confessed that it was confusing having to go through enchanted emotions.
    Kinkajou wants to keep spending time with him in order to sort out her feelings, but she thinks he is adorable. She once twined her tail around Turtle's and glared at Anemone, as though to say that she would be doing it even without the love spell.
