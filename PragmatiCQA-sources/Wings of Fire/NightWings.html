   NightWings are based on monitor lizards.
   They have been described to have forked, pitch-black tongues, as well as dark scales which are usually black or in shades of dark green, blue, or purple. They also have silver, white, gray, purple, dark green, or blue underbellies, and dapples of silver scales running along their necks. Their wings have silver scales scattered across them like the stars of a night sky, forming different patterns. These patterns are genetic.
   NightWings have been described with black, dark blue, dark brown, purple, or dark green eyes. They have straight horns.

   On the volcanic island, NightWings ate mostly carrion. They would bite their prey, poisoning it with bacteria from inside their mouths, and leave it to decease. After it was dead, they would return to eat it.
   On the island, seafaring birds could be found. They would also hunt in the rainforest, including sloths, and may have gathered some fruit. While living on this island, most NightWings would eat once per week, which contributed to their malnutrition.

   NightWings are a nocturnal
   tribe that can blend into the night sky and shadows. They can also breathe fire, and most modern NightWings have mouths stuffed with dirty bacteria which can poison animals with a single bite.
   However, it is noted that after searching through the corpses of dead NightWings, there was no venom found in their teeth.
   They have a strong sense of smell
   and powerful night vision.

   NightWings hatched under one full moon have the power of mind-reading or prophecy, and those hatched under two have both. Dragonets hatched under three full moons will have both of these powers, made stronger by the third moon. NightWings once thought that the third full moon gave
   animus powers
   , though this was later disconfirmed.
   The power of the gifts vary, such as
   Clearsight
   having strong foresight.
   When the NightWings moved to the volcanic island, knowledge of these powers was forgotten, possibly on purpose.
   NightWing eggs touched by moonlight will turn an eerie polished silver color, while untouched eggs remain an ebony black.

  <p key="e4d07ddd-cd54-4900-96c3-ff811bd77422">
   Mind-reading NightWings can observe the thoughts of those around them. They cannot 'rummage around' in another dragon's head, but hear thoughts as the dragon thinks them, often only picking up on jumbled words, pictures, and emotions; thoughts are louder and stronger to the mind reader when they are touching the former.

   , dragonets were taught ways to block out the minds of others, though this practice was lost over time without powers.
   Mind readers can project their thoughts to one another to have mental conversations, and powerful mind readers may be able to block the visions of prophets.
   Dragons with this power hatched under a blood moon can project their thoughts to any dragon, not just other mind readers.

   Prophetic NightWings can see flashes and visions of the future. On occasion, they will have a true prophecy, which will manifest as words rather than a vision in the dragon's head.

   , prophets would sometimes take regular visions and translate them to sound like real prophecies. Very powerful prophets may be able to look into the future and follow individual timelines.
   Futures have been described as 'webs', as they overlap and are easily mixed up.
   Prophets hatched beneath a blood moon can see terrible events and natural disasters with particular clarity.

   While living on the volcanic island, NightWings poured a great deal of effort into making their tribe seem mysterious and powerful to hide their real weakened state. They trained their dragonets to lie about their 'powers,' and kept them confined to the island until at least age ten to prevent any breaches of information.
  </p>
  <p key="c161e5a7-ef77-4e25-9ef0-84001f832021">
   They were exceptionally skilled at keeping secrets,
   and NightWing information was given to dragonets as they grow older.
   They were not allowed to leave the island until the age of ten,
   and most NightWings would try to counter sarcasm with more sarcasm, as though every conversation was a competition to see whose wit was more biting. No one ever stopped to acknowledge that someone else was funny.
   In general, sentimental sincerity was not a NightWing trait.
   Loyalty, secrecy, and obedience to NightWing elders were the most important lessons for dragonets within the tribe,
   and young NightWings were kept away from other tribes, as older dragons did not trust them to keep NightWing secrets.
   When Battlewinner disappeared from public view, enforcement of guard and patrol duties was considerably weakened,
   and many citizens believed that guarding and patrolling an island that no one was able to locate was ultimately pointless.
   Leaving the island and traveling to the mainland was every young dragonet's dream.
   NightWings were not supposed to be seen within the mainland,
   and Deathbringer's main objective as an assassin was to ensure that the NightWing involvement in the War of SandWing Succession was kept under heavy secrecy.

   NightWing mothers typically named their dragonets.
   The tribe also functioned nocturnally.
   NightWings of higher status lived in higher homes in the cliffs, while lower ones lived closer to the bottom, where less desirable homes were.
   They also appeared to value knowledge and reading, as they had an extensive library
   and honored the first librarians of the kingdom.
   In Clearsight's time, the NightWings were famous for their intertribal relations, open trade partnerships, literature, and artwork, which had been sold across the continent. Dragons from all over Pyrrhia brought them new ideas, inventions, and discoveries.

   NightWings had a centuries-old feud with the IceWings due to the legend of
   Foeslayer
   and
   Arctic
   , known as the
   NightWing-IceWing War
   . The feud is at least on pause as of

   Ancient NightWing nests were depicted as bowls of carved stone that are lined with black fur, and eggs are typically hatched atop high mountain peaks.

  <p key="ab6acb2d-8acb-4af4-904e-548759e21c7f">
   NightWing names may be descriptive of the dragon's personality (such as
   Thoughtful
   ,
   Greatness
   ,
   Wisdom
   , and
   Listener
   ), relate to an aptitude or job (such as
   Mastermind
   ,
   Deathbringer
   , or
   Quickstrike
   ), describe or relate to their physical appearance (such as
   Bigtail
   and
   Strongwings
   ), or be night-themed (such as
   <a href="Starflight.html" key="77284537-ca40-4057-a713-899d60857b52" title="Starflight">
    Starflight
   </a>
   ,
   Eclipse
   , and
   Moonwatcher
   .)
Their names may also be inspired by the NightWing powers (names such as Fatespeaker,
   Mindreader
   , and
   <a href="Morrowseer.html" key="e53bcf9b-c0df-45d3-ad7e-bdb1831e5864" title="Morrowseer">
    Morrowseer
   </a>
   .) Most NightWing names are meant to give a sense of strength or mightiness.

    NightWings appear to have excellent night vision, but still can not see in total darkness as well as
    SeaWings
    can.

    It is mentioned that NightWings are trying to readjust to their natural (nocturnal) schedule in

    NightWings are shown to be very loyal to their tribe and have an arrogance similar to the IceWings. Morrowseer once explained to Starflight: "We assumed NightWing superiority was something all NightWings hatched with."
   </li>
   <li key="0277c1af-2a60-4634-810e-6e1629b5c822">
    Tui considered the mention of the Darkest Night, a night where all three moons are new, to be present somewhere in the NightWings' stories.

    In the audiobooks read by
    Shannon McManus
    , all NightWings speak with a British accent, except for Starflight, Fatespeaker, and Moonwatcher, who were raised away from the NightWings and did not develop this accent.

    NightWings are able to hang from the ceiling like bats.
    This is also depicted in the graphic novel.
