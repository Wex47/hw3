   , it is easy to forget that Turtle is a prince.
   He almost never behaves like royalty, as though he does not want to be noticed at all — quiet, mumbly, and sticking to the background.
   Other dragons do not typically have much faith in his ability to protect others,
   and he is quite fearful of everything.
   For most of his life, Turtle believed that staying ordinary and unmemorable would make him a dragon nobody would expect anything from, so nobody could ever be disappointed by him.
   Winter wondered if he was afraid of something or simply boring, and he assumed he could easily get rid of Turtle by applying the right pressure.
   Turtle is a good dragon at heart, but he is terrible at using animus magic, and it was hard for

   Initially, Turtle is quiet, laid-back, friendly, shy, persistent, and complacent, happy to go along with what others want without many opinions or objections of his own. He has referred to himself as boring,
   , uninteresting,
   unremarkable,
   and forgettable,
   a description that multiple other dragons have agreed with.
   Qibli also once described him as easygoing and "used to being invisible."
   Winter remarked that Turtle acted nothing like a prince and that if he had been an

   for information, and seemed curious rather than horrified by a fragment of a
   dragonflame cactus
   that had recently been used in a lethal explosion. He is insecure,
   with not much self-confidence, but often appears only calm and easygoing.

  <p key="8c494b9a-dae9-4e92-9300-118de44445cc">
   He is extremely cautious, as he went to great lengths to avoid the knowledge of his animus powers being discovered by anyone.
   He has a desperate want for love or acknowledgment from Coral.
   Sometimes while thinking about using his animus power to hurt other dragons, he looks down and sees his talons covered with blood, and he quickly shakes his talons to get the vision away.
   Turtle is very insecure about his magic, and worries about hurting and killing other dragons.
   He has a habit of eavesdropping,
   and he has acted bravely in order to protect his friends.
   He lacks good communication skills,
   and is often nervous, but is willing to try his best to be helpful.
   His soul is almost entirely good,
   and after the events of

This makes her believe that Turtle is evil in some way. When the vision ends, Anemone, Turtle, Queen Coral, and Tsunami have disappeared into Jade Mountain Academy. Moon takes this vision as a sinister attempt to murder Anemone that will happen sometime in the future and keeps a wary eye on Turtle afterward. After the tumult of an explosion in Jade Mountain Academy that leads to Moon revealing that she is a mind-reader and prophet, Turtle is the only one who stayed with her, taking Moon to an underground lake in the caverns of

       Darkstalker emerges from the mountain. Turtle notices that Darkstalker seems to hate him and quickly enchants a stick to hide him, and later, completely from Darkstalker, making him non-existent to Darkstalker. Darkstalker reveals that when Peril burned his talisman, his magic returned to him. Winter argues with him, but Darkstalker 'wins' him over, which is later revealed to be from a spell cast by Darkstalker. Despite Moon and Qibli's concerns, both dragons deny Darkstalker using magic. Eventually, Darkstalker goes hunting with the rest of the Jade Winglet, and Turtle goes to warn Jade Mountain Academy on a suggestion of his clawmates.

She finally started paying attention to him when he started following her and Darkstalker around, but the attention was not positive. After their duel on the beach and Turtle hiding her from Darkstalker, he seems to regard her more as his younger sister, who he should protect, and she seems to respect him as an older brother. She once referred to him as a doofus,
    but he is reassuring and kind towards her,
    and she is willing to listen to and react upon how he feels.

   Coral is Turtle's mother. Turtle aspires to become an author, like her. When Coral reveals the truth of the deaths of the SeaWing princesses to him, she expresses pity and sympathy toward her son, even wrapping one of her wings around him to bring him in close.
    Though she forgets his name immediately afterward, she promises to remember it going forward, and she and Turtle share a tender moment. Afterward, Coral writes regular letters to her son while he is away at Jade Mountain Academy, sending Turtle her newest stories and thanking him for his help dispelling the Albatross Spectre cast by Darkstalker.
    Each letter Turtle receives from his mother makes him feel stronger and braver, more like the hero he hopes to be.

   Gill is Turtle's father. Before Anemone ever hatched, Gill found Abalone sick. Panicked, Gill rushed out of the Hatchery and called to the first dragons he saw, which happened to be Turtle and two of his brothers. He told Turtle to find Snapper, his co-general, and returned to the Hatchery to watch over his sick friend. However, Turtle could not find Snapper that day, and Gill gave up waiting, knowing that if he waited any longer, his general would surely die. He swam to the Healers, and however fast he may have swum, when the Healers and the king returned to the Hatchery, the two princesses were dead. Gill, furious, tracked his son down and blamed him for the unborn princesses' deaths, telling a distraught Turtle that he was very disappointed in him because Turtle had not gotten to Snapper quicker.
    This event discouraged Turtle from wanting to be a writer and hero,
    leading him to believe that his unhatched sisters' deaths were his fault and that his father had died hating him. However, Coral revealed that it was not Turtle's fault, as Snapper was stationed at the Summer Palace instead of the Deep Palace.
    Gill was captured by the SkyWings before he could tell Turtle about his guilt for being angry at him.

Anemone's spell enchanted Kinkajou to believe that Turtle was handsome, brave, and noble, but Kinkajou was aware that these feelings were a result of the spell and was quite angry towards Anemone and towards herself.
    Turtle has an enormous crush on her,
    and after not mentioning the spell for about a month after Anemone released Kinkajou from it, Turtle admitted that he still had feelings for her.
    Kinkajou likes him too, but confessed that it was confusing having to go through enchanted emotions.
    Kinkajou wants to keep spending time with him in order to sort out her feelings, but she thinks he is adorable. She once twined her tail around Turtle's and glared at Anemone, as though to say that she would be doing it even without the love spell.
