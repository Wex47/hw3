   Scarlet was strong,
   with dark orange scales
   and bright yellow eyes
   that were as sharp as talons.
   Her orange
   wings were enormous,
   and their top side
   had rubies embedded around the edges.
   A row of tiny rubies
   and diamonds
   were also embedded between the scales over each of her eyes.

   She was usually wreathed
   in white smoke emitting from her nostrils in a steady stream that would coil thickly around her horns.
   She also had a deep,

   During her reign, a fine coat of golden chain mail adorned her, hung with rubies and amber drops around her torso,
   as well as a circlet made of gold and diamonds,
   medallions around her neck, and rings on her claws.
   Occasionally, she would also wear a diamond-studded vest with small black chain links.

   was melted into a hideous dark mess

   She was referred to as "Melty-Face" by a SkyWing

   Scarlet was insane and murderous, and other dragons very rarely argued with her.
   Living in excess, Scarlet took pleasure in adorning herself and her throne room with gemstones and precious metals, and would grow petulantly upset when she did not get her way.
   She thought very highly of herself, and had portraits made in her image.
   She was not above lying and manipulation, and would go to great lengths to control dragons around her to do her bidding, particularly

   .
   She was a smooth liar, sly and cunning with her words,
   as well as ruthless and unbothered by killing or having dragons killed, including her own daughters.
   She used fear of her violent wrath to prevent her subjects from doing things she disliked,
   and she rarely lost challenges to her authority.

   described her mind as loud, angry, and all over the place. Ruby described her as "The Super-Murdery Queen of the Mountains."
  </p>
  <p key="e46cc932-cc04-468b-b4c7-e0ee42a0bd9a">
   Her self-indulgent need for 'thrilling' forms of entertainment meant that her violent
   arena
   , fed by the war, was very important to her.
   She wished to continue the war, heedless of its impact on her subjects, for her personal entertainment and to keep her throne secure.
   She also kept a close hold on Peril, her arena champion, who was encouraged to draw out battles for Scarlet's entertainment.

   She was less confident

  </p>
  <p key="47806336-bf53-454c-a0f6-6216d719f85c">
   She was shown to be opportunistic, taking advantage of what Chameleon could do very early on.
   She also seemed to find it amusing and easy to manipulate Peril, despite the latter wanting to kill her. When changing dragons with the jewelry Chameleon provided, she put loyalty to her as one of the first criteria most of the time, showing how she expects all her subjects to feel the same.

      and began to use the war to entertain herself. Scarlet would place prisoners against each other in the SkyWing Arena, claiming that if they won enough fights, they would go free, using Peril as her champion. It also mentions that no one had ever gone free before, because they died fighting Peril, the

      SkyWing.
      <p key="6c02e624-e5b8-4fc7-be2e-3e36a3ca2363">
       About eight years before, Kestrel, one of her most loyal soldiers, entered the breeding program and yielded one large egg with twin dragonets. Because one of the dragonets was born with too much fire, and the other too little, Scarlet ordered Kestrel to kill the dragonets and stay out of the program for the rest of her life, a SkyWing tradition.
      </p>
      <p key="be80a547-2112-466f-8070-6e561b049882">
       Despite this, Kestrel tried to flee with them, prompting Scarlet to change the order: if Kestrel killed one of the dragonets, she would be allowed to go free with the other. Kestrel "killed" the one with too little fire, her son, with her own claws, an act that haunted her for the rest of her life. Scarlet, however, revealed she had lied and ordered her guards to take Kestrel back for trial and kill the other dragonet. Kestrel tried to flee with the dragonet with too much fire, Peril, but was burned upon contact with her firescales, leaving burn scars. She was forced to flee alone, leaving her only daughter with Scarlet. For years, Kestrel feared that the hatchling had been killed by Scarlet.
      </p>
      Scarlet named the dragonet Peril, and, due to her invulnerability and blazing hot claws that were shown to be able to melt through metal, she trained Peril as a killer and to be the champion of the SkyWing arena. She made Peril burn most of the eggs that would be due to hatch on the

      </a>
      . To ensure Peril's complete and utmost loyalty, she told her that Peril had killed her twin by burning him before they hatched and her mother attempted to kill her, but was thwarted by the SkyWing queen. Scarlet also told Peril she needed to eat black rocks to survive, which was a lie. When Peril got mad at Scarlet for not telling anything about her real mother and refused to eat her black rocks, Scarlet poisoned her real food without telling her what she had done to make Peril more loyal and easily controlled.

      Scarlet then pitted Peril against Clay, knowing Peril was using the
      Champion's Shield
      in an attempt to save her mother, Kestrel, from death, and that Clay could not be harmed by her firescales. During the battle, Scarlet told Clay to use his venom, not knowing that it was Glory who possessed that ability. Ironically, upon asking him to do so, Glory reared up, easily broke her chain, and spat a stream of venom at Burn, who pushed Scarlet in front of her as a shield. As the venom took effect, Scarlet screamed in pain. She was then presumed to have been killed during the chaos, with her daughter, Ruby, succeeding her.

The object Scarlet throws ends up being Queen Glory's severed head. While the guards and Tsunami chase after her, Turtle removes a slip of paper from the head and discovers that it was not actually Glory and that the paper was enchanted to make a MudWing's head look like hers. Ever since the incident, Peril decides that it is her responsibility to go find her old guardian and kill her for the safety of Clay and everybody else Scarlet intends on harming. Turtle decides to join her on the search for the old queen.

       , Moon, and Turtle, Peril runs into her long lost father, Chameleon. Chameleon (in his SkyWing shape, Soar) introduces himself and takes Peril to Scarlet. Peril is surprised to the Ex-Queen is there and realizes that Chameleon betrayed her. Scarlet realizes that Chameleon did not tell her about his shapeshifting and she says to him "So you still haven't told her. I love it." Scarlet then leaps on Chameleon making Peril think that Scarlet is trying to kill her father. She almost tries to go and help him but stops, wanting to know what her father did not tell her about. But Scarlet was not attacking Chameleon but instead trying to rip off his pouch containing his different dragon shapes. Chameleon transforms into his old, lime green RainWing self. Scarlet shows to her how he used magic to create his SkyWing self and that he enchanted a necklace made of thick metal for her that can take away Peril's firescales forever. Chameleon offers the necklace to Peril and Peril takes it and puts it on. Suddenly, she loses her firescales, as well as losing her memories of Clay and becoming completely and forever loyal to Scarlet as part of the spell's secret side effects. Peril becomes happy and agrees to kill Ruby and get back Scarlet's throne.

       , from the palace wingery. Because of Peril, nobody wants to attack Scarlet because they believe that Peril would kill them because they do not know that she lost her firescales. Scarlet, Chameleon, Peril, and Cliff settle down in Scarlet's old throne room and wait for Ruby to arrive. Scarlet orders Vermilion to come to her and she scolds her son for not following any of the orders she asked while she dreamvisited him in her weirdling tower cell, such as bringing an army back to rescue her or try to secretly assassinate Ruby. She assures to Vermilion that he will be punished.
      </p>
      Ruby arrives early the next day with a squadron of SkyWings. Her plans to defeat Scarlet were foiled, for Scarlet was holding Ruby's beloved son, Prince Cliff, hostage, and would make Peril kill him if she took another step. Ruby surrenders to her and is imprisoned. Scarlet orders Peril and Chameleon to watch Cliff on the highest tower in the palace. After Cliff escapes and reunites with his mother, Scarlet appears and tells Peril to burn them. She refuses, finally realizing she is done with Scarlet and her games, and Peril takes off her necklace and regains her old self. Ruby, then, officially challenges Scarlet to a fight for the throne. Ruby was beaten down by Scarlet and was losing the fight until Peril learns by Chameleon that Ruby was Tourmaline all along, and when she destroys Ruby's earring, Ruby transforms into the long lost SkyWing princess, Tourmaline. Scarlet says she made up Ruby because Tourmaline was becoming too dangerous. Tourmaline then finishes the duel by snapping Scarlet's neck and shouting "For the SkyWings!", ending Scarlet's life and her reign as queen of the SkyWings.

Turtle later thought again about his and Peril's adventure together, including setting out to stop Scarlet, remembering how it had felt a lot safer than what he was doing now. When Darkstalker asked Moon which tribe was the wealthiest, and she said that the SkyWings might have a lot of treasure because of Scarlet.
