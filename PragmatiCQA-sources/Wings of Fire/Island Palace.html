   The Island Palace was an elegant, sprawling complex of pavilions, courtyards, rooms, terraces, gardens, and walkways that covered an entire island at the heart of the
   <a href="Kingdom of the Sea.html" key="bf4f55c5-ae7d-434d-a7d0-705c0f7fc9a6" title="Kingdom of the Sea">

   </a>
   .
   Several of the walkways led to pavilions over the water, with glass floors. Carvings of pale pink sea horses and bone-white dolphins dotted the frangipane
   gardens. Iridescent-blue paua shells gleamed in wave patterns, with white foam made from inlaid pearl, all along the polished wooden walls.
   It contained terraces, surrounding gardens,
   a centered decorative pond,
   and buffet tables during the delegation party between
   Eagle
   ,
   Lagoon

   . In honor of the SkyWing guests, the gathering was lit with warm glowing lanterns around the gardens.
   Giant aquariums around the terrace were full of luminous blue jellyfish, some of them trailing tangles of long, slender tentacles. The scents of vanilla, ginger, and basil came from the long tables of food, and colorful hibiscus flowers dotted the bushes and were scattered across the conversation couches.
   The palace hosted a dance floor,
   bar,
   drinks table, and a statue of Lagoon, inlaid with sapphires that matched her scales. It was composed of marble and coiled over a fountain with its wings spread, water spraying from her mouth.
  </p>
  <p key="bd6929bf-4d3d-4fdf-9d90-abeb7ba7854e">
   A circle of lanterns led to a path between the gardenia bushes,
   which then transferred into gravel
   winding paths,
   leading to a wooden walkway that bordered an overwater pavilion over the edge of the ocean. It contained overhead windows and a glass floor, with a dead orca and a pair of fishing spears mounted on the high ceiling. A balcony looked out to sea, and a pair of boats hulked against the side wall.
