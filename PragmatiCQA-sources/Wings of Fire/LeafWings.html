   LeafWings can be various shades of green and brown, even to the point of being nearly black in color.
   They can also sometimes have golden or pink-ish streaks over their bodies and wings.
   They also have webbed spines along their neck and back, similar to a

   LeafWings have a flat, plated tail, ending in a leaf-shaped oval at the tip. Their wings are leaf-like, playing directly into their name-sake. They're also slightly transparent, with veins in the webbing and rounded edges. Their horns appear to be skinny and flat-ended, and the scales above their eyes go over the top of their horns, giving it a partially plated look.
  </p>
  <p key="5312bb6c-50ec-4f20-a5cc-a92df2d9b75f">
   Their scales are uneven, vaguely resembling chloroplasts and plant cells. They have a plated underbelly and a slender body shape. Their legs seem to be slightly short and thin. Their eyes can be green or brown.

   The PoisonWings have been seen carrying leaf or grass pouches containing deadly plants and insects.
   These pouches are attached to the dragon's body with harnesses made out of vines, leaves, or grass.

   LeafWings are omnivores. The sun gives them energy, allowing them to eat infrequently.
   They consume animals in the Poison Jungle, such as panthers and capybaras, and fruit such as mangoes. LeafWings also consume bugs such as grasshoppers and snails, usually as a snack or treat. They have also been confirmed as somewhat autotrophic. Sundew feeds

   LeafWings can absorb energy from sunlight, and are accomplished gardeners.
   They may possess leafspeak, which allows dragons to understand plants. Leafspeakers may convince plants to grow at an accelerated rate,
   or in a certain way,
   though they cannot produce them from nothing.
   As leafspeak is genetic, selective breeding may be employed to achieve stronger leafspeak abilities; two leafspeakers may produce a dragonet with stronger leafspeak than either of them.

   Some LeafWings can swim.
