   Chameleon was a lot grumpier than other RainWings.
   One of the RainWing healers said that he was horrible and that they would wake up from
   suntime
   to find Chameleon just staring at them, as he rather hated other RainWings.

      At an unknown point in time before the series, Chameleon was banished from the Rainforest Kingdom because of his inability to change the color of his scales, which made the other RainWings "uncomfortable." This came from a snout deformity that stopped him from sleeping for more than an hour. The lack of sleep made it so that he could not change his scales' color, which had also affected his personality. This lead to many of the RainWings thinking he was creepy, different, and weird. Sometime afterwards, he found Darkstalker's Scroll and got someone to teach him to read. By reading some of what was written on the scroll, Chameleon figured out what it could do and learned how to write. Using the scroll, Chameleon created many shapes for himself. He moved into the

When Webs suggested that the Talons attack the SkyWings, Cirrus hinted that there were only about forty members of the Talons of Peace, while there were countless SkyWings. Nautilus mentioned his backup plan and said that Webs would be a problem, in which Cirrus pinned him down, stating that Webs had failed them. He was instructed to kill Webs because of the

        's dream when Scarlet visited her. Upon their arrival, they found a dragon named Pyrite, and Chameleon, disguised as Cirrus, did not want them to take her. Winter thought maybe Pyrite was an animus and Cirrus wanted to reintroduce the magic back into the IceWing bloodline, but forgot the idea when he noted that he showed no sign of returning to the
        Ice Kingdom
        . Winter also noted that he and Cirrus should have recognized one another, as he was royalty. Winter asked if Cirrus knew his parents,
        Narwhal
        and
        Tundra
        , and Cirrus said he might.

        Glacier

      </p>
      Wearing his NightWing mask Shapeshifter, Chameleon was overheard by Moonwatcher, Winter, and Qibli talking to Scarlet. He later went to the dragonets' camp to retrieve Pyrite and attacked Kinkajou, smashing her into a tree and leaving her in a coma. It is mentioned in Escaping Peril that he did this because of his grudge against the RainWings. He failed to capture Pyrite and leaves with his eyes burned and frozen by Moon and Winter, although it healed when he changed shape.

       on their adventure with the Talons of Peace. When

       Later, Turtle saw a dragon, most likely Chameleon, diving into the forest behind him and Peril. The next morning, Turtle found talonprints that did not belong to him or Peril beside their sleeping spot. They likely belonged to Chameleon. When Peril and Turtle flew away, Peril spotted Chameleon in his NightWing form staring at her.

Ex-Queen Scarlet joined them, and the SkyWing informed Peril that he was a RainWing named Chameleon. He offered her a gift of a strange necklace that he claimed would cancel the effects of her

      Peril and the Jade Winglet confronted Chameleon, but found he was too powerful for them to take on. Turtle used his magic to steal his scroll, smashing it onto Chameleon's face, injuring him severely. Peril cried out for the dragonets to stop, believing that Chameleon did not deserve his punishment no matter what he have done. The dragonets then ran away, leaving Chameleon with his shapes.

      Bog later appeared in the

Bog walked into a room and closed the door, later coming out as Chameleon's superpowered NightWing form, Shapeshifter. Kinkajou relayed this information to Qibli, who quickly realized that the two dragons were Chameleon, and most likely arrived with Vulture. Qibli and Kinkajou devised a plan to steal Chameleon's pieces of Darkstalker's Talisman. Qibli walked up and acted as a distraction, while Kinkajou grabbed Chameleon's earring, which had the pieces of talisman in it. Qibli quickly told off Chameleon, then knocked out by Kinkajou. The pieces of the scroll were later used to give Darkstalker a new life as Peacemaker.
