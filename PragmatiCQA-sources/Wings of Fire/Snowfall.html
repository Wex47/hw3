   Snowfall is large
   and regal,
   with shiny
   white scales.
   She has dark blue eyes
   and curved white wings.
   She formerly owned a heavy metal crown, described as being too large for her head, that was studded with diamonds and metallic spikes that looked similar to icicles.
   She wears a pouch around her neck that contains a copy of

  <p key="461bd60b-b033-4973-bc61-3afb96e4369b">
   According to
   Winter
   , Snowfall is "abundantly blessed with mean smugness."
   When Winter was raised to first circle in the
   Circle rankings
   , Snowfall was fuming and gave him a glare that "should have melted all of the ice in the
   palace courtyard
   ."
   She also smirked at him afterwards, as if she did not expect his new ranking to last even a week.
   She was described to smile outwardly, but her voice was all murderous stalactites,
   sugary-sweet and mocking.
  </p>
  <p key="ea58280c-7b33-4dd8-a110-cbdeddc46eb6">
   Despite her rough exterior, Snowfall struggles with a lot of isolationist worries, anxieties and fears. She is scared, but in a powerful, reactive way; she acts out very dramatically whenever she is upset. She has gone through enormous trauma due to the
   IceWing plague
   and her mother's death, and is heavily driven by anxiety and fear. As a new queen, Snowfall was terrified of any threat to her
   kingdom
   .
  </p>
  <p key="ccf919b8-f56b-4731-bcad-031c9a738f14">
   Before her experiences with the gift of vision, Snowfall was easily annoyed,
   stressed,
   rude,
   cold,
   anxious,
   distrustful,
   and indecisive.
   She often felt as though being queen was similar to living inside a snowstorm that never ended. She tried her best to start each day with a list and a plan and energy to solve all of her problems, but was always buried in them before nightfall.
   She felt overwhelmed
   and pinned down by the responsibilities of being queen,
   and
   Lynx
   noted that Snowfall had not smiled since the beginning of the plague.
   She was panicked by all of the things that might go horribly wrong,
   and often woke up feeling more tired than she had been before.
   She became heavily insecure about her ability to rule due to the events of the
   Battle of Jade Mountain
   , when she was exposed to the thoughts of her subjects that were doubtful and worried about her authority as queen.
   She often felt a sense of suffocating dread when reminded of the gift of order,
   and her everyday life was full of anxiety.
   She was insecure and easily bored.
  </p>
  <p key="46585cdc-e4f6-4b89-ac91-0d188c7ec4df">
   Snowfall's nights were long, and she felt a constant pressure inside her head, knowing the gift of order was always waiting for her and feeling as though her every move was being watched.
   She believed outside dragons were inherently dangerous,
   but still felt a twinge of guilt after sending the

   refugees away from the Ice Kingdom.
   She felt begrudgingly sympathetic towards

    Hazel

   ,
   and after the gift of vision transformed her into
   Atala
   , she began hoping that the

   </a>
   's family would remain safe.
   She found it difficult to accept that she cared about the Pantalan dragons
   or wanted to explore the Hives of Pantala.
  </p>
  <p key="5574a014-1f72-458b-a48f-7d3e727b36ac">
   Snowfall is still proud,
   imperious,
   sarcastic,
   commanding,
   naturally
   grumpy,
   smart,
   gruff,
   irritable,
   and impatient.
   However, she has become more empathetic
   and believes that other dragons were not as evil as she had once thought.
   She became less paranoid
   and afraid,
   protecting her tribe with strength
   and indomitable ferocity.

      When Winter scans the rankings of the IceWings in the First Circle, he notices that Snowfall has moved to the top position on the dragonet side in front of Lynx, who was in second place. When Winter is moved to take her spot, she shoots him a nasty glare that says that she hates someone else being in first place. When the IceWing dragonets are dismissed, Snowfall stays to congratulate him sarcastically and to stare at the rankings, along with
      Hailstorm
      , "as if she could reshape them with the sheer force of her eyeballs," clearly meaning that she was upset about the new rankings.

       Snowfall, Hailstorm, and
       Narwhal
       are shown demanding the Jade Mountain staff to tell them where Darkstalker is, which they did not know. Winter shows up, and she is shocked, looking at Hailstorm as if expecting him to disappear, then demanding to know how Winter is alive. Winter exclaims that it is not important and begins helping his friends convince her not to fight the NightWings. Before she can consider, NightWing scouts with gifts of speed appear and start attacking, throwing the discussion away and officially beginning the battle. Narwhal is killed while blocking the NightWings from her, but Snowfall keeps relatively calm throughout the battle and launches her own frostbreath attacks. She was later teleported back to the Ice Kingdom along with the other IceWings, due to
       Anemone
       's spell.

Jerboa III tells her that animus magic is not currently working for anyone on the continent. To prove this, Jerboa enchants a stick to turn anything it touches green and offers it to Snowfall, who declines it. Jerboa then taps herself and a nearby rock; nothing happens, proving that magic is not working. Snowfall becomes enraged and storms off, saying Jerboa was useless, concluding the epilogue.

       Snowfall hears about the SilkWings and LeafWings flying towards her kingdom. Lynx goes with her to see these mysterious dragons. At first she thought they were SeaWings, RainWings or NightWings, but when she meets them she finds that they are from Pantala. Before they get there, she puts on some old animus enchanted items such as the Gift of Strength, the Gift of Vision and the gift of stealth. She goes with five guards, but disguises the IceWing army with that enchantment. She reveals them and flies the dragons to the

      Later on in the book, we see that Snowfall has a dream of the Forbidden Treasury, where she meets
       Opal
       and asks her if the ring was made by her. Opal confirms this, and says that it was a tool for the queens to use to be more powerful. She then proceeds to tell that Snowfall can now take off the ring, as she has finished the visions that Snowfall was experiencing. Snowfall then takes off the ring and puts it on the pedestal, and then is able to have a good night's sleep.

   , Snowfall even said she would have liked to "Drop a mountain on her."  After becoming queen, Lynx treated Snowfall the way she always had, challenging Snowfall to races around the palace or arguing over points of IceWing law during class.
    In the beginning of their friendship, Snowfall was often annoyed by how Lynx lacked the proper IceWing etiquette when addressing a queen.
    Lynx is often sympathetic towards
    and worried for Snowfall,
    and helps her calm down.
    She defends Snowfall against insults from others.
    When Snowfall woke from her first dream from the Gift of Vision, her first thought was to turn to Lynx for company.
    Snowfall was at first hesitant to consider Lynx a true friend,
    but Lynx is able to read her well
    and wants to listen to Snowfall's worries.
    Snowfall and Lynx became argumentative
    and angry at one another's differing viewpoints on IceWing traditions,
    and Snowfall accusingly thought of Lynx as being judgemental.
    She was irritated by Lynx's suggestions and interjections,
    but Lynx sounded genuinely full of joy when realizing Snowfall was safe after she fainted,
    and covered for Snowfall against Cricket's questions.
    Snowfall brought Lynx as her representative during a diplomatic meeting with the other Pyrrhian queens,
    and Snowfall was conflicted when it came time to choose the IceWing representative for the journey back to Pantala. She wanted Lynx to come back to the Ice Kingdom, to keep Snowfall sane and join her new council, and she trusts Lynx more than any other IceWing. She began crying during the farewell ceremony, but assured herself that Lynx would have to come back.
    After Lynx admitted that she was only coming back to the Ice Kingdom before the journey to hang out with Snowfall for a couple more days, Snowfall nearly beamed or burst into tears.
    Lynx protected her from Tundra when Snowfall destroyed the Gift of Order, and supported her decision fully, clapping immediately after Snowfall smashed the wall.

    After Snowfall compared her friends to friendly turtles on the inside, Sky gave her a gigantic grin.
    She felt very worried for him before he left for Pantala,
    and wanted him to be able to access the Ice Kingdom anytime he needed her.
    When she returned to the Ice Kingdom, Snowfall built a snow sculpture of a snail in his honor, and Lynx teased her for thinking about him so much.
