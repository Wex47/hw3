   NightWings are based on monitor lizards.
   They have been described to have forked, pitch-black tongues, as well as dark scales which are usually black or in shades of dark green, blue, or purple. They also have silver, white, gray, purple, dark green, or blue underbellies, and dapples of silver scales running along their necks. Their wings have silver scales scattered across them like the stars of a night sky, forming different patterns. These patterns are genetic.
   NightWings have been described with black, dark blue, dark brown, purple, or dark green eyes. They have straight horns.

   On the volcanic island, NightWings ate mostly carrion. They would bite their prey, poisoning it with bacteria from inside their mouths, and leave it to decease. After it was dead, they would return to eat it.
   On the island, seafaring birds could be found. They would also hunt in the rainforest, including sloths, and may have gathered some fruit. While living on this island, most NightWings would eat once per week, which contributed to their malnutrition.

   NightWings are a nocturnal
   tribe that can blend into the night sky and shadows. They can also breathe fire, and most modern NightWings have mouths stuffed with dirty bacteria which can poison animals with a single bite.

   They have a strong sense of smell

   Mind-reading NightWings can observe the thoughts of those around them.

   Futures have been described as 'webs', as they overlap and are easily mixed up.
   Prophets hatched beneath a blood moon can see terrible events and natural disasters with particular clarity.

   They were exceptionally skilled at keeping secrets,
   and NightWing information was given to dragonets as they grow older.
   They were not allowed to leave the island until the age of ten,
   and most NightWings would try to counter sarcasm with more sarcasm, as though every conversation was a competition to see whose wit was more biting. No one ever stopped to acknowledge that someone else was funny.
   In general, sentimental sincerity was not a NightWing trait.
   Loyalty, secrecy, and obedience to NightWing elders were the most important lessons for dragonets within the tribe,
   and young NightWings were kept away from other tribes, as older dragons did not trust them to keep NightWing secrets.
   When Battlewinner disappeared from public view, enforcement of guard and patrol duties was considerably weakened,
   and many citizens believed that guarding and patrolling an island that no one was able to locate was ultimately pointless.
   Leaving the island and traveling to the mainland was every young dragonet's dream.
   NightWings were not supposed to be seen within the mainland,
   and Deathbringer's main objective as an assassin was to ensure that the NightWing involvement in the War of SandWing Succession was kept under heavy secrecy.

   NightWing mothers typically named their dragonets.
   The tribe also functioned nocturnally.
   NightWings of higher status lived in higher homes in the cliffs, while lower ones lived closer to the bottom, where less desirable homes were.
   They also appeared to value knowledge and reading, as they had an extensive library
   and honored the first librarians of the kingdom.
   In Clearsight's time, the NightWings were famous for their intertribal relations, open trade partnerships, literature, and artwork, which had been sold across the continent. Dragons from all over Pyrrhia brought them new ideas, inventions, and discoveries.
