   Starflight has midnight-black scales
   with glints of purple and deep blue in them.
   The silver scales on the underside of his
   black wings
   spray outward, like a splash of water.
   He has a black head
   and claws,
   as well as sinewy shoulders
   and a worried snout.
   The space between his wings is narrow, and he is not very burly.
   He wears a white blindfold
   over his green eyes,
   and has long burn scars
   streaking across his scales and snout.

   worried,

   described his thoughts as constantly busy, ticking through all the things he needed to do to get the library completely ready.
   He frets
   and complains often.
   After he was temporarily kidnapped by Morrowseer, he appeared to be bossy towards his friends, although he only wanted to keep them all safe by doing so.
   He often overthinks and worries so much that he ends up not doing anything at all,
   and can sulk when he is upset. However, he is a useful companion, as he has valuable information such as geography and flight patterns constantly on his mind.
   Reading is his speciality,
   and he is very smart, totally unreliable, and terrified of the world, despite him wanting to be brave and helpful.
   He tries to know everything so that he may be useful, but he is not a good fighter, and he is not brave.
   He is talented at memorizing things and repeating those facts over and over, even when no one seems to be listening.
   He will easily subside when argued with.

He was slightly smaller than the other dragonets (except Sunny), and he loved scrolls and the stories told by their guardians, mainly Dune, thus becoming the subject of the dragonets' jokes and taunts they loved to make. While he was born with three full moons in the sky, Starflight received no NightWing powers because he hatched in a cave, where the moonlight could not reach his egg.

Starflight also had a private meeting with Morrowseer, whom he feared would discover he had not discovered his powers yet. He was shown helping Tsunami escape from the chains their guardians used to stop her from preventing Glory's murder. He and Sunny contributed to their escape attempt by burning the scrolls as a smoke signal to Clay and Tsunami, which led to him and the rest of the dragonets getting captured by

      At the beginning of the book, Starflight constantly made warnings about the SkyWings hunting for them, telling his friends they should hide under the trees.

      Starflight was very helpful to Glory as she tried to unravel who was kidnapping the RainWings. Glory observed that he'd probably been hopelessly in love with Sunny his whole life.

He instructed them to make the SkyWing guards inside switch alliances to Blister. When Starflight was not able to get them to switch, a group of NightWings killed the SkyWings. Starflight suspects that this would have happened no matter what they convinced the guards.

       was leaving the dormitory and she wanted to follow him. They followed Flame down to the prisons where Deathbringer was being held. Flame asked Deathbringer tips on how to be an assassin. Flame thought what Deathbringer told him was useless. When he was gone, Fatespeaker asked him where to find the queen. Deathbringer told them, and they found her in a cauldron full of lava. Starflight and Fatespeaker were both extremely shaken. Starflight tried to figure out how this was possible. The queen then explained to him that while fighting an IceWing, the IceWing shot its frostbreath into her mouth. In order to counteract the ice forming inside of her body, she was confined to a pool of lava. They explained to her Morrowseer's plan but she refused to help. After returning to the dormitory, Starflight attempted to use the dreamvisitor again. He succeeded, entering Glory's dream and explaining to her what happened, and she prepared her army.

Viper accidentally scratched Flame's face with her tail and fell into the lava. Morrowseer brings Flame to the healers, and Starflight realized the false dragonets were not born on the brightest night when Ochre was unwilling to save Viper, yelling "I have no idea if my egg was blood red, and I don't plan to risk my life finding out!"

       Starflight later developed a plan to escape from the Night Kingdom. Fatespeaker and Starflight took Flame and brought him out to the tunnel to the rainforest, claiming to have been ordered by the NightWing queen to take the SkyWing to the RainWings to be healed. After successfully tricking the guards, they met up with Glory, Tsunami, and Sunny. He told them about the NightWings' plan to take over the rainforest. Glory decided to attack the NightWings, leading to the

       . In case he did not survive the battle, Starflight decided to tell Sunny he loved her. They visited Queen Battlewinner and said that the NightWings could live in the rainforest if they made Glory their queen. Battlewinner was enraged by this, and attempted to attack them, but as she jumped out of the lava, the ice within her killed her. Greatness agreed with their plan and came with them.
      </p>
      Fatespeaker, Glory, and Starflight freed the RainWing prisoners, and the volcano started to erupt. They continued to free the prisoners along with

The volcano erupted, most likely killing Morrowseer. When Starflight was severely injured, Clay protected him from most of the blast with his fireproof wings and brought him back to the rainforest. Though Starflight still sustained burns on his body and his eyes, he believed he felt Sunny's talons press against him, but also heard Fatespeaker's voice. Starflight was then shot with a sleeping dart and plunged into unconsciousness, described to be "as black as a NightWings' scales."

There was a second viper in the box who leapt out and bit Burn. The dragons at the meeting panicked and took flight. Fatespeaker and Sunny tried to hold Starflight up. Clay was bitten while he sent the three of them backward in his effort to save them.

      Starflight is the librarian at Jade Mountain Academy and ensured that the library was built in such a way that he could get around it, and know where different scrolls were located by feeling carved nameplates and stamps. He was first introduced when Moonwatcher went to the library to borrow a scroll on animus-touched objects. Starflight gave her a library scroll. Moonwatcher senses that he initially had fears about whether he'd be able to do a good job as a blind librarian, but had gotten over them for the most part. Starflight also seems to know dragons just by the sound of their footsteps. Starflight was also shown to know how to read a carved script.

They snuck away to talk to Queen Battlewinner and figured out her secret together. Fatespeaker chose Starflight to do this, making it seem like she trusts him. Starflight likes Fatespeaker better than all the other NightWings. Fatespeaker has a crush on him but he currently likes her as a friend, as when Starflight is confessing to Sunny he glances at Fatespeaker to think about how his feelings for her could never be the same as his affection towards Sunny. Even if Starflight's feelings are not romantic, they are still good friends.

   Starflight was afraid of Kestrel and her short temper. He would hide in the shadows if the SkyWing was nearby, and would often get burned by Kestrel just like all the other dragonets. He did, however, stand up to her by helping Sunny melt the chains Kestrel put on Tsunami.

   Starflight shares many traits with his father, including scale patterns and extreme intelligence. At first, Starflight wanted to have a good relationship working with his father. But, when he learned what Mastermind was doing to the RainWings, he felt horrified. He still helped his father but was wary of him. Mastermind was very impressed with Starflight and wanted him to be his assistant. After

   SkyWing arena
   . When she answers, he comes up with the idea of Peril moving the black rocks in order for the dragonets to escape. During the time when she was out of earshot, he and Tsunami point out to Clay of her crush on him. Peril lost Starflight's trust when she betrayed the dragonets to Queen Scarlet.

Regardless of his personal opinion of her, he is still aware of Peril's crush on Clay and tolerates her at Jade Mountain Academy as long as she stays out of the library.

   Starflight is thought to admire Sunny's joyful personality but does not interact with her much in the first book. It is thought that he did love her then, too, for when Tsunami said to Peril that Sunny was like a little sister to all of them, Starflight acted like he considered Sunny differently. However, he does stand up for her against Tsunami, Glory, and even Morrowseer. In the second book, he is noticed to want to do everything in his power to protect her. In the third book, Glory is near certain he has had a crush on her for his entire life. Starflight has known Sunny and the other dragonets since hatching. Sunny seems to have the most positive attitude about Starflight and his lectures. In the fourth book, he is directly stated throughout the story to be in love with Sunny. He finally admits it to her, but in

    He is comforting and reassuring towards her,
    and she often feels pity towards him when he is ignored by the other dragonets.
    When he became too tired to carry her through the ocean when the dragonets visited the Kingdom of the Sea, he seemed disappointed to be deprived of her contact.
    He worries about her safety,
    and she believes in his ability to know everything and to be right.

   Tsunami and Starflight have known each other since hatching. Like the other dragonets (with the exception of Sunny), she is annoyed by Starflight's lectures, and she often shushes him. Despite this, they seem to care for each other, shown when they refuse to fight each other in Scarlet's arena. Tsunami once had a slight crush on Starflight, before realizing how annoying he could actually be, due to the ongoing endless lectures. Starflight often wishes he had Tsunami's "crazy-brave" courage, and Tsunami believes that the reason he studies so hard and reads so much information is so he can be an asset to the group. Tsunami does not particularly like taking orders from him,
    but when she is not annoyed with Starflight, she mainly feels sorry for him.
