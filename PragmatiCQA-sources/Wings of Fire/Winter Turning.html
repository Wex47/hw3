  <p key="dcdd6860-1956-4359-9e32-c950f55b2873">
   The book began two years earlier from Hailstorm's PoV. He was taking his younger brother, Winter, out flying to find a
   scavenger den
   near
   <a href="Sky Kingdom.html" key="15c1d10a-3bd6-4a33-a4d9-022371018571" title="Sky Kingdom">
    SkyWing territory
   </a>
   . Winter became increasingly worried that they might be caught by the
   SkyWings
   , but Hailstorm assured him that he could fight off a couple of SkyWings if they did get caught, and they were doing this for Winter's "weird little obsession." Hailstorm continued to boast about his position in the Ice Kingdom and being the second-in-command of the IceWing army.
  </p>
  <p key="b5fc1fd0-79b4-4e53-b0a0-99ab75bebe4f">
   Fourteen SkyWings appeared from the trees behind them, prepared to kidnap both IceWing princes. Hailstorm threatened to kill the SkyWings that dared to come close with his frost breath, but the main SkyWing in front did not seem to care. Hailstorm attempted to make a deal to let Winter go and take him instead. Winter was entirely against the idea and tried to be brave and stay with Hailstorm, so his older brother started shaming him and calling him useless, knowing that it was the only way to get Winter to leave. Finally, the SkyWings decide to let Winter go and knock out Hailstorm.
  </p>
  <p key="2981e9ee-ae2d-460e-80ea-1b5cd4f872b7">
   Later, when Hailstorm woke up, he realized he was face to face with Queen Scarlet. A strange SkyWing was standing near the Queen's throne. After a short discussion, Scarlet told the strange SkyWing that Hailstorm was dangerous and needed to be imprisoned. The SkyWing turned and approached him, making the IceWing prince feel cold with fear. She reached for something around her neck. Hailstorm, too entranced by her eyes to move, could not run. He noticed that her eyes were not SkyWing eyes anymore. Her eyes were black, and they were going to "swallow him whole."

   The book started with a flashback to when Winter disappointed his family when he was two years old. He was out in the Ice Palace's courtyard along with his brother and sister, Hailstorm and Icicle, his parents, two of Glacier's dragonets, and others. Tundra discussed catching a polar bear for Queen Glacier, and after some more talking, they all set out to hunt.
  </p>
  <p key="05cf5b7d-283d-473c-9398-3ba279bba993">
   Winter decided to head out towards the open sea, knowing that polar bears were often on islands off the coast. After some searching around, he finally spotted a female polar bear with two of her cubs. But before he can kill them all, he noticed a lone

   with a spear and who was also willing to hunt the polar bears. As Winter wonders about it, his mother suddenly yelled at him, and Winter desperately tried to catch the polar bears, but they disappeared into a passageway.

  <p key="80979a47-85cc-4e89-a58d-ca146b0ba149">
   Disappointed in his son, Narwhal hissed at Winter, and Icicle taunted him about the failed hunt. Winter does not look back at the scavenger, deciding not to tell his parents about it so that they would not kill it for the feast. The hunting incident sends Winter down to the
   Fifth Circle
   . Winter remembered that he had struggled to make his way back up to the rankings and tried so hard, with no luck, to do so. He later recalled Hailstorm and his dumb decision to leave him there and why it was all his fault, and the memory ended. Winter was then shown standing in the middle of a rainstorm in a forest looking at his scavenger, who was in the cage Winter built. As Winter tried to make

   leave by setting him free, he heard his name and turned around, seeing the rest of his winglet — Moon, Qibli, Kinkajou, and Turtle, running up to him. He demanded to know why they were all here, and Moon said they were looking for him. She also told him about her mind-reading and prophecy powers, causing him to get extremely angry at her for keeping that secret from him.

   . After landing next to a river, Winter was suspicious when Moon commented on how he must hate it there because of the heat. Qibli was about to eat an orange toad, but Moon stopped him due to its terrible effects and offered him a dragonfruit instead. Winter mentioned how he hated fruit and immediately tried to eat a sloth but was stopped by Ex-Queen

   , to get the scout captains to meet at
   the pavilion
   as soon as possible. Heliconia said that she should stay to guard Glory, but Glory argued that "I think seven guards are quite sufficient," making Deathbringer protest that there was no point in a secret invisible guard if the queen tells everyone about it. They then met the scout team, and Queen Glory asked if they have seen an IceWing. They all answer no, so Moon — having heard a thought from one of the RainWings — prompted them by asking if they have seen anything that could have resulted from an IceWing's frostbreath. A RainWing scout replied that they had, and they led them to the spot. They found an area frozen with frostbreath, and then a

   's dead body. Queen Glory assembled search parties for Icicle and sent Moon, Winter, Kinkajou, and Qibli to the dragonet wingery. To escape and find Icicle before anyone else does, they started a game of "hide-and-seek" with RainWing and NightWing

   </a>
   counting up to a thousand. Unfortunately, the dragonets could not count, giving the team less time. While they were distracted, Winter froze a hole in the wall, and the four of them jump through. Kinkajou explained that the dragonets would not give up until they have searched every square inch of the wingery. Winter planned to ditch them and go home or find Icicle himself but failed to execute the plan after Moon alerted the group of a nearby search party. The group hid under a nearby fallen tree to avoid getting caught.

   After the search party left, Winter wondered if Moon was right, that he did have a confusing mind. He remembered his first rankings test with Hailstorm and Icicle, and he wondered why his winglet risked their lives for him. He wondered if he could ditch them now, as they were distracted. Kinkajou reprimanded Winter, telling him, "The words you're looking for are thank you." Winter decided maybe it would be better to follow them, just for a little while longer. They later arrive at the secret

   When they found her, Icicle was in horrible condition. Her wounds from Jade Mountain Academy had not healed, she was covered in red and blue blood, and she had not slept to avoid seeing Scarlet in her dreams. Icicle explained that she would sit by the lava when she got tired, and the heat would wake her up. Kinkajou attacked Icicle because she insulted Queen Glory, but right before Icicle killed her, Glory shot her with a tranquilizer dart and arrested Icicle for "murder and attempted murder." As Icicle tried to fight sleep, Winter whispered to her to make Scarlet tell her the truth, and that if she did, Winter would kill Glory. Kinkajou admitted to leaving a trail for the queen to find them. Qibli asked Moon if she could get into Icicle's dream and find out what Scarlet is telling her. Moon replied that she was trying but that Icicle was sleeping too deeply to dream.

   , Moon explained to Winter that Scarlet has left. Winter then asked Moon if Icicle was alright and if Scarlet said anything about Hailstorm. Moon replied that she trusted that Winter would not kill Glory because if Winter did, he might start a war between the IceWings and Glory's two tribes. Moon stated that she thought Winter would not kill any dragonets and that Winter did not just think about himself, that he thought about his tribe too. Winter said that sometimes he only knew one thing: that he hoped he would never hurt Moon. Kinkajou then popped up behind Winter and exclaimed she figured it out. Moon followed Kinkajou into the pavilion as Winter calmed himself. As Winter stepped in, he saw Kinkajou under the firefly jars. Moon drew a picture of a mountain that she saw behind Scarlet when the ex-queen was

   Cirrus
   and

   . Winter did not remember Cirrus because Cirrus had been in the Talons of Peace before he was born. Pyrite remembered the mountains and offered to lead them to it. Winter touched her scales and identified her as an animus dragon.

   While everyone was asleep that night, Winter told Moon about his theory. Moon said to him that Pyrite's thoughts were all the same as if she did not think anything else. They wondered if she could be the part of the prophecy; "

   " However, Qibli pointed out that Pyrite could not be an animus because the SkyWings had not had one possibly as long as the IceWings.

  <p key="fa3a023d-3881-45b9-bd9a-88843a109d76">
   In the morning, they saw the mountain peak and found a scale, which Pyrite identified as Scarlet's. They searched the valley, but with no signs other than the destroyed structure where the scale was found. Scarlet visited Winter's dreams that night and told Winter that she would kill Hailstorm in the morning. After realizing that Scarlet must have seen them dreamvisit him, Moon, Qibli, and Winter headed off to find Scarlet. They were able to find her and saw that Scarlet had a NightWing ally. Scarlet decided she no longer had any use for Hailstorm and sent the NightWing to get Pyrite. Pyrite was necessary for the death of Hailstorm.

  <p key="a461974f-83e0-420b-a591-43b3b0daea24">
   The trio flew back to their camp, waking up Pyrite and Kinkajou. Winter started fighting with Pyrite, and then Kinkajou shrieked upon the NightWing's arrival. He struck her three times and then knocked her into a tree. Moon and Winter sprayed fire and frostbreath on him until he flew away. While Moon saw to Kinkajou's wounds, Winter took off Pyrite's special necklace. When he did, Pyrite turned into Hailstorm. Hailstorm had almost no memories of the past two years and tried to remember more, but it was difficult for him. Their reunion was cut short when they recalled Kinkajou's current state.
  </p>
  <p key="58ea667c-fd6b-4f7b-a217-e62c01167ca5">
   The trio took turns carrying Kinkajou to Possibility, a town in the

   . Moon and Kinkajou were taken to a MudWing doctor named
   Mayfly
   . Hailstorm, Qibli, and Winter waited in the garden, where they disassembled Pyrite's necklace, discovering a strange piece of paper inside that read:

   Winter wanted to try on the necklace to see what it felt like being Pyrite and to see what Hailstorm went through. But before he tried it on, Qibli ripped off number four to see if Winter could take it off. Winter tried it on and ultimately regretted his choice. Winter forgot everything about being an IceWing until he took the necklace off.

   After Hailstorm made a fool of himself, Winter decided to take Hailstorm back to the IceWing kingdom. Moon was trying to make him stay, but he left and told Moon that they were never friends, and he could never trust a NightWing. Then he and his brother left and went to the Ice Kingdom.

   for Hailstorm to remember. He said it was animus touched that if any dragon from another tribe were to pass, they would die. As they entered the palace, Winter and Hailstorm met their father, who said, "So. My two sons have returned to me. One I thought would never come back — the other I hoped never would." Winter looked at the rankings and saw Icicle and himself in the last two places. Narwhal was extremely displeased with Winter for his actions, but Hailstorm claimed Winter did so to save his life. The next day during a rankings ceremony, Narwhal added Hailstorm back into the rankings. However, he was placed at the bottom of the Seventh Circle. Winter was moved into first place for bringing Hailstorm home. Hailstorm then attempted the

   Hailstorm and Winter went deep into the ice caves. Winter was appalled to see that there were almost a hundred dragons encased in ice. Hailstorm then flew over to the spot where Foeslayer was frozen. He tapped on the frozen dragon, bringing Foeslayer to life. They introduced themselves, and then Hailstorm attempted to kill her. Foeslayer was about to stab him with the spear when Winter knocked her aside. Winter tried to make scenarios where they both lived, but Hailstorm disagreed with all of them. Foeslayer requested for one of them to kill her, which Hailstorm did. Winter then told Hailstorm to go out and claim victory and that he would sneak out later and stay away from the Ice Kingdom. Several hours later, Winter revived Foeslayer and told her how much she stole when she took away the tribe's animus dragons. She argued that the IceWings might have used the magic for evil and revealed that she did not steal Prince Arctic. Winter freed Foeslayer and proceeded to go with her, as she knew exactly where the "
