   The Great Hall is the unofficial entrance of Jade Mountain Academy. The cave has a dimmer light in comparison to that of outside,
   with enough room to fit four hundred dragons inside comfortably and still have enough space for more to fly overhead. There is also sunlight pouring into the cave, with twisting stalactites that sometimes reached the floor, forming twisting columns. A huge bronze gong hangs against the back wall, with three flying dragons carved into its surface. When the school first opened, a huge banner made of woven green vines reading "Welcome, students!" in giant purple-and-white flowers hung from two stalactites. Two tunnel openings form along the cave's left wall, with two more on the right wall. Next to each entrance, a map is hung, displaying tunnel routes to help students find their way around the huge caves.

Many of them have quotes such as "Knowledge is a flame in the darkness" and "The claws of war are no match for the wings of wisdom." At the end of the hall, a room full of iridescent green sunlight is present. The light is the result of the sun shining through large semi-transparent leaves placed over windows, with one of those windows torn open by Icicle who broke out in

Every corner had a spot to curl up and read in, sometimes a rock ledge, sometimes a pile of moss, sometimes a bed of reeds, and sometimes carpets. Sunlight comes down from skylights in the roof and filtered through leaves covering the windows.
   There is a circular wooden desk labeled 'LIBRARIAN' in the center where

  <p key="ec218be4-85bd-4dca-a2a9-b627fcdb2545">
   Library stamps are part of the library system in Jade Mountain Academy. Every scroll in the place has a wooden stamp, which, if taken out, is stamped on the parchment corresponding to the borrowing student. When returned, their library stamps are stamped on the first one to show that the student returned it.
  </p>
  <p key="f28ec06a-473a-4f16-af31-5203e4247432">
   The library stamps are described as small rectangles of wood, about as long as two claws, and with the student's name carved backward in raised letters on one side. Every student gets a library stamp when they visit the library at Jade Mountain Academy. Starflight keeps them behind his desk, and he hands them to students when they see him for the first time since arrival.
