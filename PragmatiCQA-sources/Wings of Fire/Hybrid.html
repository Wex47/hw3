   Dragons have lengthy natural lifespans, though they can be killed by injury,
   illness,
   and poison,
   among other causes. The average dragon lifespan is roughly one hundred fifty years,
   though the oldest a dragon has been known to live without magic before his death is one-hundred-ten years.
   Dragonets stop growing rapidly at seven years old, and this is considered adulthood or maturity in most tribes.

   SkyWings have a larger wingspan than most tribes.

   Dragonets molt their scales upon growth, at least so in the case of SkyWings.
   Dragons also do not have sexual dimorphism.

  </p>
  <p key="7226f0a7-33b1-48de-94ce-1773ed801ea7">
   All dragons are primarily quadrupedal. All Pyrrhian dragons possess six limbs, as do LeafWings — these consist of two wings and four legs. HiveWings and SilkWings have eight limbs, consisting of four wings and four legs. Wings are attached to a dragon's shoulders and have a slightly transparent wing membrane stretched between five small bone digits, each of which has one small claw on the tip. A larger claw is attached to the front of the third digit. Dragons have overlapping scales that vary in color and shape from tribe to tribe. Dragons require their tails for flight, and severe tail injuries may ground a dragon for life.
  </p>
  <p key="87c9fe0c-4883-4b9a-be2f-8fec5ded2f2d">
   Pyrrhian dragons have a vulnerable spot at the base of their tail.
   Their bones are difficult to break — almost as hard as diamonds
   — though they can be dislocated.
  </p>
  <p key="98da5e69-cd78-4162-8ded-ffd835fb9b80">
   Dragons typically have large claws at the base of each foot, with five on the forelegs and five on the hind legs, though polydactylism may occur. All dragons can fly, although SilkWings are hatched without wings and cannot fly until six years of age when their wings grow after their metamorphosis, as were BeetleWings. Some can also hatch with freckles on their bodies, usually at various amounts.
  </p>
  <p key="5fcd1e71-9763-4f8d-8d0f-811b2ec477ef">
   Dragons can faint,
   sweat,
   and cry.
   Dragons are able to have allergies
   and become intoxicated.
   They can also have seizures
   and hiccups,
   as well as medical conditions such as deformities, tumors, or mental illnesses. Most dragon tribes hate getting wet,
   with the exception of SeaWings and sometimes IceWings.
  </p>
  <p key="dfe81794-b013-46da-b538-72d8b79275b6">
   It is mentioned on several occasions that dragons have a hoarding instinct, preferring shiny or brightly colored objects. Instead of a currency system, dragons on Pyrrhia typically barter; gold, gems, and other treasure are used in this system.
   Pantalan dragons use a currency called scales.
  </p>
  <p key="9e1462d6-0225-4f4a-bc69-afabe55c2f91">
   Dragons reproduce via eggs, usually laid in clutches of two or more.
   Eggs may contain twin dragonets.
   Dragonets can speak within a day of hatching,
   and a one-year-old dragonet is capable of speaking in full, if broken, sentences, as well as flying.
   Dragons can have birthmarks. In a SeaWing's case, they can have
   Aquatic
   birthmarks.

   Dragons of non-vegetarian or non-herbivorous tribes may choose to be vegetarian.
   Most dragons can survive for up to a month without food.

   Each tribe has specialized structures and abilities that differentiate them from the other tribes. Most typical is some sort of exhalation, most commonly fire. SkyWings, NightWings, and SandWings can breathe fire at any given time, whereas MudWings can only breathe fire when warm enough. IceWings exhale a freezing breath — though heat can temporarily thwart this ability
   — while RainWings can spit corrosive acid that only affects biological matter and can kill a dragon in seconds. SeaWings are the only tribe on Pyrrhia that cannot exhale anything that may be used as a weapon, and none of the tribes on Pantala can, aside from the occasional acid or poison-spitting HiveWing. The most commonly modified structures in dragons are the wings, claws, or tail. Dragon fire smells different from normal fire.
   Average dragons are physically strong enough to rip a tree from the ground and throw it across a short distance.

   . Each tribe differs in its traditions and values of life due to habitat and physiology. They are advanced enough to have speech and writing — all dragons speak the same language. The SeaWings use their bioluminescent stripes to communicate in a separate language called Aquatic for communication underwater. All Pyrrhian tribes live in separate kingdoms except the RainWings and the NightWings, who both inhabit the Rainforest Kingdom. However, Pantalan tribes do not live in separate kingdoms like Pyrrhian tribes. Instead, HiveWings control most of the continent and rule over the SilkWing tribe, while the LeafWings live in the

   Most dragons feel tribal loyalty, most notably NightWings, HiveWings, SkyWings, IceWings, and SeaWings. They seem to view their tribe as extremely important to their identity, and consider acting against others of their tribe or their tribal queen to be traitorous. Most NightWings, IceWings, and HiveWings and some SkyWings have feelings of superiority about their tribe. Each dragon tribe also has their own religious beliefs.
   All dragons love treasure.

   It is stated in the books multiple times that dragons have a system of body language. Dragons may have a sort of "code" for greeting one another, featuring mid-air flips and thumping wings.
   Dragons may raise their wings in a shushing gesture,
   and they spread or wave their wings to catch attention.
   Flicking one's tail at someone is another way to get their attention
   and can also be used to indicate something of interest.
   If a dragon lashes their tail, it is a sign of anger or impatience.
   SeaWings may flare their gills when angry,
   and RainWings flare and color their ruffs when angry or indignant.
   Dragons also use their claws to indicate numbers.

  <p key="e268cd9d-46da-43f9-b9ba-31bdc88e2299">
   Nudging or brushing another dragon's wing or twining tails together is a sign of affection and closeness;
   dragons may notice if others are close enough to show affection this way.
   Wrapping wings around one another, hugging, and pressing snouts together are also signs of affection.
   Dragons tent their wings over others as a way to comfort or embrace them in a protective gesture.
   Dragons also kiss as a way to express affection.

   Dragons on Pantala seem to be slightly more technologically advanced than dragons on Pyrrhia. They use books instead of scrolls,
   use eyeglasses,
   make chocolate and work with sugar,
   grow plants in terrariums,
   run stores,
   and create massive silk bridges between the Hives.
   Sundew shows an impressive knowledge of plants and insects, similar to RainWings. There are also water towers in Pantala,
   used by SilkWings and HiveWings living in the Hives; the existence of plumbing is suggested in

   Book of Clearsight
   said it must be so. The LeafWings, however, demanded to see the book, which Queen Wasp would not allow because it would expose her plan. The LeafWings were nearly wiped out in the following war and proclaimed by the HiveWings to be extinct. All the trees in the HiveWing-controlled areas were cut down to prevent the LeafWings from coming back. HiveWings later lied about the war, claiming that LeafWings had tried to wipe the HiveWings and SilkWings out.
