   Peril has unusually bright,
   glowing,
   shimmering,
   copper-colored,
   fiery,
   metallic-orange scales
   that emit smoke and heat, giving her the appearance of burning from the inside.
   She has a long, pointed tail,
   with veins of gold running through her glimmering copper wings.
   She has sly,
   startling,
   eerie,
   flame-blue
   and black eyes,
   as though someone had bundled up the sky and immersed it in fire until it burned from the inside.
   She has sharp white teeth and horns that are not yet fully grown.
   Her scales emit a blistering,
   burning heat that feels like standing too close to an erupting volcano.
   Her face conveys quite a few very intense emotions.

   Peril is matter-of-fact,
   proud, bold, loyal,
   loving, sarcastic, curious,
   stubborn,
   and hopeful.
   She often attempts to be polite,
   and she feels devastated when her actions negatively affect those she loves.

   detested her, striding around as if she knew everyone would clear out of her way.
   Initially, she seemed untroubled by how much death she had caused;
   after knowing how many dragons are afraid of her scales, she often tried to make herself as small as possible
   and is quiet upon meeting other unfamiliar dragons;
   she seemed surprised when Clay offered to talk to her.

  <p key="029f2ebc-3fc1-4994-814e-21f8471118ea">
   Peril also appeared to be extremely sensitive, likely caused by how dragons often reacted around her and how the SkyWings appeared initially joyed to see her exiled. Throughout the second arc, Peril learns that taking away her firescales does not change who she really is; she believed that no dragon deserved to be manipulated by another, and that her decisions and loyalties are decided by herself instead of dragons who expect her to be somebody else.

Dragonets like Peril — referred to as having "firescales," — were usually thrown off the highest mountain peak in SkyWing culture, but Scarlet said that she would allow Kestrel to keep one dragonet so long as she killed the other.

       Kestrel was told that she had to kill one of her dragonets. She chose to kill Sky, whom she thought was weaker and would not survive anyway, but Scarlet reversed the order and told Kestrel to kill her other dragonet as well. Kestrel tried to flee with Peril, but was too badly burned by her dragonet's firescales and was forced to drop her before fleeing, leaving Peril at the mercy of ex-Queen Scarlet.

       Since then, Peril spent her childhood and early adult life as Queen Scarlet's puppet. Scarlet used her in gladiatorial arena battles for the queen's own entertainment and ordered her to kill dragons who had somehow displeased her. She also deceived Peril into trusting her by lying about her past; Scarlet told Peril that she killed her brother in their egg and that Kestrel had tried to kill her, but Scarlet saved Peril and sentenced Kestrel to death. Scarlet also manipulated Peril into believing that she had to eat black rocks, possibly coal, every day to survive with firescales as a ploy to force Peril to both rely on Scarlet and rely on staying within the

Due to her invulnerability and ability to easily burn opponents to death, she was raised by Queen Scarlet to become her arena champion, where she killed hundreds of dragons in the arena without a second thought, becoming a "monster" who did not know how to be "nice." Thanks to Queen Scarlet, killing was the only thing Peril knew and was "good" at.

       Later, when Clay was taken as a prisoner, Peril befriended him, and began to develop strong feelings for him when he was the only dragon who understood her right. When Clay told her that, when he hatched, he was supposedly so vicious towards the other eggs that the
       guardians of the dragonets
       had to throw him in the river, (proven later to be his

       Inside the arena, Peril helped heal Clay's scratches and wounds by fetching and pouring warm mud on his back and later helped him rescue his friends. At one point, Queen Scarlet forbade Peril from watching Kestrel's trial, and Peril mentioned that she had not been prohibited from doing so before and wanted to know why, so she decided to hide behind Clay and watch the trial in secret. She then learned the truth about her mother, who turned out to be Kestrel, and angrily called upon the
       Champion's Shield
       so she could try to protect her from execution when Scarlet ordered it. Although this ultimately resulted in the death of Peril's older friend

       Later, Peril was pitted against Clay in Scarlet's Arena for the Champion's Shield face-off. Peril was not used to dragons fighting back, giving Clay a slight advantage. Clay attempted to convince Peril to be friends, while Peril tried to get him to abandon the other dragonets for her, but Clay refused to. Due to his strength, Clay had pinned her down.

Every dragon thought it was an attack and fled, and then only the prisoners were left in the arena. At this moment, with a bit of hesitation, Peril relented and helped Clay and his friends escape.

      After Clay and his friends escaped, it was briefly thought that Peril was the 'Wings of Sky' in the prophecy, but Kestrel noted that Peril was a year too old. During the escape, Peril made peace with her mother Kestrel, although she did not go with her, claiming that they will meet up one day to learn more about each other. This never happened, however, as Kestrel was killed by

Denying that Clay would perish, Peril tackled him, stabbed her talons into his leg, and burned out the poison. Although Clay had fireproof scales, Peril's claws put him in terrible pain; he thrashed, trying to throw her off, but several other dragons held him down. Although Peril left a nasty scar and limp, her attack did end up saving his life. Afterward, Clay said that maybe Peril was their 'Wings of Fire.' Saying this left Peril hopeful, though not for long.

Ruby accuses Peril of killing Tourmaline and betraying her friends, which Scarlet replies to by saying that Tourmaline is still alive, but hidden. Ruby is shocked, but Scarlet dismisses this quickly and forces her to give up her kingdom. An unknown MudWing, seemingly one of Ruby's soldiers (possibly

Peril states that she was only "following orders" from the first Queen. Ruby orders two of her soldiers to lock herself up in one of the dungeons where Kestrel was once held.

       Scarlet then goes on a tour of the palace with Vermilion to see everything Ruby 'messed up' and becomes furious after learning that Ruby had spent almost all of the SkyWing treasure on turning the SkyWing arena into a hospital, forcing him to help her, and Queen Scarlet taking over the Sky Kingdom once more. After Prince Cliff escapes and reunites with his mother, Scarlet appears and tells Peril to burn them. She refuses, finally realizing she is done with Scarlet and her games, takes off the necklace, and Ruby officially challenges Scarlet to a fight for the throne. Ruby was beaten down by Scarlet and was losing the fight, until Peril shows everyone that Ruby was Tourmaline all along by burning an animus earring worn by Ruby that was enchanted, and Scarlet says she made up Ruby because Tourmaline was becoming 'too dangerous.' Tourmaline then finishes the duel by snapping Scarlet's neck and shouting, "For the SkyWings!", ending Scarlet's terrible reign.

       In the end, Tourmaline thanks Peril, and Peril reveals who Chameleon is, forcing him to show Tourmaline what the scroll could do. Chameleon was also forced to make Tourmaline back into Ruby, as Tourmaline stated that she only wanted the appearance of Ruby, to Chameleon's dismay as he said that he was disappointed that she did not want any superpowers. Peril also thinks wistfully of how she wished she could dance at the full moon festival.

      Peril and the rest of her group, who eventually came to rescue her, forcefully confiscated Chameleon's scroll. After seeing Moon and the rest of the dragonets unknowingly get into a fight about what happens to the scroll, she burns it, saying that it was "too much power for one dragon to have." However, in the course of doing so, she accidentally released Darkstalker, the ancient NightWing who's animus power was in the scroll. Since the power no longer had a vessel, it returned to Darkstalker, and he was able to use it to escape his prison underground. At first, the dragonets thought that Jade Mountain was falling, leading Peril to think fearfully of Clay's well-being. Darkstalker burst free of the earth, ominously thanking Peril for her role in his escape.

Peril is then told that she was the reason Darkstalker was free, and her wings drooped. She keeps curling and uncurling her talons while Darkstalker has his talon on her head. Then when the other dragonets go hunting, she talks to Turtle. She tells him that she is feeling guilty, and he replies that she still did the right thing. Peril then tells Turtle to kill Darkstalker with his magic and that he should make it something really cool, like Darkstalker's face falling off or his insides exploding.

Turtle said she was spreading terror before bedtime, and she said she thought it was a good apology. She tells them about her conversation with Clay, and Qibli said Clay likes her too but does not know what to do about it. Qibli said to give him lots and lots and lots of time to figure it out. Peril sees Turtle packing and asks where he's going, to which he replied the rainforest; and she seemed a little depressed, her wings drooping and her scales almost setting fire to a scroll rack. Peril says she wished she could go, too, but Queen Glory forbid no fire in the rainforest. Then she says that she will miss Turtle a little, and Turtle responds by saying she will not because she has Clay to hang out with. She tries to hide her smile. After this, Peril is not shown in the book.

She then asks him if they could go flying together, and Clay said he would love to.

   Upon initially meeting him, Peril was oddly excited to discover that Clay believed he had tried to kill his nestmates during hatching, but after Clay admitted that he hoped he was not the same as Peril, she became hurt.
    She enjoys talking to Clay,
    and regards him as "blazing";
    Peril believed that Clay liked her how she was, and although Clay was hesitant towards her, he found that Peril was not entirely awkward, and possessed an awkwardness and sadness that he understood.
    He is honest with her,
    and she disobeyed Scarlet's orders in order to talk with him
    in addition to bringing him mud and food to help him heal from the arena.
    When talking to her, Clay's guilt about Fjord's death and his friends' capture seemed lighter,

    She avoided Clay after Osprey's death because she wanted to keep him out of danger,
    but she easily became angry
    and jealous when Clay mentioned how important Glory
    and Sunny were to him,
    and later betrayed Clay and his friends to Scarlet because she was afraid of him leaving.
    Clay felt sadness at her betrayal and guilt over trusting her afterwards,
    although he felt sympathy for Peril because she had no other friends.
    After escaping the Sky Kingdom, Clay invited Peril to join him and his friends on the journey to the

   Peril did whatever Scarlet told her to,

    She was eager to please the queen, and became afraid whenever she disappointed Scarlet,
    despite the fact that Scarlet rarely had time to talk to her
    and was typically angry with her.
    She believed that Scarlet was typically right.
    Scarlet was the closest thing to a mother that Peril ever had, thinking that Scarlet saved her egg, but she ordered Peril to kill dragons in horrible ways each day,
    and she was dismissive towards Peril's distress after Scarlet killed Osprey.
    Peril believed that if Scarlet discovered that Peril enjoyed Clay's company, she would do something awful to him in order to punish her.
    Peril later discovered that her obligation to eat black rocks was merely Scarlet trying to keep Peril under her control, as Scarlet poisoned her regular food, fooling her into believing the black rocks were her only dietary options.
    Peril was upset when she had found out that Scarlet lied to her when she said her mother, Kestrel, was dead, while she was currently alive, raising the eggs.
