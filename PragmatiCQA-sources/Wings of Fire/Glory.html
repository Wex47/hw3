   Glory has green eyes
   and brilliant
   color-changing scales that are dull in comparison to other RainWings'.
   She has soft wings,
   feathery ears,
   a long body,
   tail,
   and neck,
   and a long, delicate snout.

   Unlike most RainWings, Glory tries to keep her scales from showing emotions.
   Therefore, she is usually seen with dark
   emerald
   green scales
   and flares of orange around her ears and the underside of her wings.
   This is because she likes
   them to match the leaves around her
   and the rainforest she lives in.

   stated that she was an unusual queen for choosing a path toward peace and cooperation over clear and simple vengeance.
   She is thoughtful
   and fair.
   Although she did not seem to be bothered by the memory of using her venom to attack Scarlet,
   she is unwilling to use her venom on dragons who are unable to fight back.
   She often refuses to take orders from anyone,
   and Tsunami once regarded her to be the least trustworthy and most dangerous out of the dragonets of destiny.
   She speaks for herself,
   and the RainWing color for happiness does not often appear on her scales.

Glory was at first hesitant to let the sloth stay with her, but eventually grew fond of her and decides to let her stay. Jambu then took her to see the three RainWing Hatcheries, where all of the tribe's eggs were raised and hatched together. He explained that the RainWing tribe did not have a family system and that RainWing dragonets were raised by the entire tribe.

In this, two dragons mix their venom, and if one dilutes the other one the two dragons are related. Jambu suggested trying the venom test between themselves, and Jambu's venom canceled out Glory's, which suggested that they were probably half-brother and sister.

Looking around, Glory saw what looked like a black hole — or a doorway — on the side of a boulder.

       After showing the entrance to Clay and Starflight, Glory speculated that it had something to do with the missing RainWings. They agreed that Starflight would return in the morning with a plan, the strongest vines they could find, and the rest of their friends.

       Around midnight, they heard loud stamping, sniffing, and snorting. Something moved near the pond and proceeded to eat something, then slithering back into the hole. When the sun rose, all that was left of the dying sloth were a few scraps of fur and blood-spattered leaves.

      <p key="9fc78ef9-debc-4aaf-bd70-d232705df2d8">
       Glory told Blaze that the dragonets were here, but that they were not willing to risk coming inside the fortress. The princess reluctantly agreed to go outside, throwing a blanket on. While they walked towards the door, Glory distracted Blaze by asking about one of the tapestries adorning the stone walls, which gave Jambu time to grab the camouflaged Mangrove and pull him out the door. Glory and Jambu saw two scavengers shivering in a freezing cage. After they took them outside, they dropped the scavengers on the snow beside the fortress before following Blaze back to their friends.
      </p>
      <p key="37d58c72-00ce-4817-9a0d-ac095732dfb1">
       While Blaze introduced herself to the dragonets, Deathbringer landed behind her with two throwing stars in his talons. He hit Blaze in the neck, and also accidentally hit Tsunami in the wing, before Glory tackled him. When she saw an incoming IceWing patrol with Queen Glacier at its head, she threatened to leave him to their mercy if he did not fly away immediately. He left, and after they ensured that Blaze was safe, the dragonets, Mangrove, and Jambu headed for home. After they returned to the rainforest, Glory and Tsunami decided to spend the night in the same tree as the night before (Glory thought that Tsunami's night vision might be useful). As the thing that came from the tunnel began crashing around their hiding spot again, it was interrupted by someone whistling the "The Dragonets are Coming" song.
      </p>
      <p key="8aa912e1-ac0b-41d5-8700-a96bef06ce71">
       Whatever it was, it retreated into the tunnel, and when the whistler came into view, Glory was not surprised that it was Deathbringer. Glory tied him to a tree with vines and sent Tsunami back to the RainWing village to get Clay so that he could watch the NightWing instead. Once Clay came and relieved her shift, Glory decided to use herself as bait: she went alone into the rainforest, eventually arriving at a clearing that was marked with black, harmless stains. As she bent to sniff one of the footprints embedded in the mud, she was knocked out by a heavy blow to the back of her head.
      </p>
      <p key="b2c40a12-e09c-4410-986e-75c13c068f47">
       Once Glory regained her senses, she felt herself being dragged down a long tunnel. It was not the one she had guessed — this one sloped downward. One of her kidnappers mentioned how Deathbringer had warned him about the dragonets, but before she could think about this she was knocked out again, only to awake in a prison stationed next to a flowing river of lava. There was a young RainWing in her cell, who introduced herself as Kinkajou. Because of her young age, her talons, mouth, and wings were not bound, unlike the other RainWing captives. Glory communicated to Kinkajou through talon gestures and discovered that the NightWing guards took off her mouth band when she ate. After her band was taken off at her next meal, she sprayed venom towards the guard. He jumped out of the way, but not fast enough.
      </p>
      <p key="cd68bcc2-b853-44e8-a3e2-b94944363219">
       The second guard fled, but the third retaliated when Glory tried to spray venom at him, pinning Glory to the floor. Kinkajou sprayed venom between his wings, causing him to release Glory, and then shoved him into a ravine. Glory realized that she would never get her bonds off before the second guard raised an alarm, so she ordered the first guard to carry them across the lava river.
      </p>
      <p key="9c023000-7319-4762-bdee-90aa88d50cc7">
       The NightWing only responded with a groan, but Clay and Deathbringer showed up just in time for their rescue. However, Deathbringer circled back to join his tribe when they neared the tunnel, as he did not want to be punished for helping them. After Glory, Clay, and Kinkajou fought with the NightWing guards stationed at the tunnel, they fled into the rainforest, where Glory spoke with Queen Magnificent about what she had seen. When the queen did not seem to care and refused to save them, Glory challenged Magnificent for the RainWing throne, as she knew that she could not save the prisoners without an army. Instead of a battle to the death to become queen, the RainWings had devised a series of challenges that included things such as camouflage, flower hunting, venom-shooting contests, tree gliding, and fruit gathering.
      </p>
      By the final venom-shooting contest, Glory and Magnificent's teams were tied. Kinkajou, competing against
      <a href="Grandeur.html" key="3052c068-a666-4238-9e56-c48274c99fda" title="Grandeur">
       Grandeur
      </a>
      , was losing by the end of the tie-breaking match, but a sloth tumbled out of the trees in front of the target board right after Grandeur had spat her venom. Kinkajou jumped up and pushed the sloth out of the way, but Grandeur spat her venom and hit Kinkajou's wing. Frantic, Glory tried her venom to counteract Grandeur's, and the melting stopped as their venom met. Grandeur forfeit the contest when she realized that Glory was descended from the original RainWing royal family, knowing that Glory would be a better queen than any of the current ones. Glory was officially crowned the queen of the RainWings, but Clay suddenly appeared with news of Starflight's disappearance, as well as a guess that he had gone to warn his tribe about Glory's plan.

      ), returned to their friend's overjoyed welcome, they discussed the plan to infiltrate the NightWings' home and rescue the captured RainWings. Glory was worried, however, that most of her tribe would not be able to use their venom on another dragon, even if it meant life or death. Sunny, though, found a solution by suggesting that the RainWings use their tranquilizer guns and darts to knock the NightWing guards out, which avoided violence on both sides.

       After the first wave of RainWings knocked the tunnel's guards out, Glory took Starflight with her to one of the RainWings' cages so that he could show her how to unlock them. Glory sent other members of her tribe to rescue any other RainWings that they saw, and to camouflage themselves as NightWings while they did so. While Glory and Starflight were searching for the NightWing ruler,

The princess led them down a small tunnel that led to Battlewinner's throne room, which was empty except for a huge black pot of lava in the center. When Battlewinner emerged, Starflight told her that she was never going to make it to the rainforest alive and that she should give the NightWing tribe to Glory so that they would not share the same fate.

       Battlewinner, seething, refused and flung herself at Glory — but it was no use, as the ice was taking over her body in the absence of the lava. After the former NightWing queen froze to death, the ground started to shake and rumble. Glory and Starflight hastily ran to the NightWing dungeons, where they freed Deathbringer and

       with a set of keys found in a coal niche. As they exited the fortress, Starflight told the gathered NightWings that accepting Glory's rule was the only way to live, unless they wanted to fly over the ocean. Tsunami, stationed at the tunnel, required each NightWing to pledge their allegiance to Glory before she allowed them to pass.
      </p>
      As the last few remaining NightWings fled into the tunnel, Morrowseer threatened them, and the volcano exploded. Clay tried to shield Starflight with his fireproof scales, but he was not fast enough, as the lava had permanently blinded Starflight's eyes.

They would find Blister through the Talons of Peace, Sunny would dreamvisit Moorhen to get a message to Burn, and Sunny would also dreamvisit Blaze. There was a short discussion about who should dreamvisit Blaze, and all the dragonets except Tsunami voted for Sunny.
At the meeting, Glory brought many RainWings disguised as NightWings and SkyWings as replicating the NightWings and SkyWings would cause the least complication. Glory herself was a SkyWing and pointed out the irony in replacing the SkyWing in the prophecy, yet appearing to be one when the prophecy was finally fulfilled. At the meeting, Blister gave Burn a box with two

Glory summoned a meeting at the Royal Pavilion, calling a few scouts to report if they had seen anything suspicious. One RainWing mentioned a patch of ice near the Bayan Tree after Moon suggested signs; Glory and Winter prepared to leave, along with Moon and Qibli. Near the tree, there was an unnaturally shaped mound of dirt, which contained a bloodied and frozen NightWing. As Glory realized that Icicle was nearby, she sent the four dragonets to the RainWing Wingery for their safety.

      While the dragonets escaped from the Wingery, Kinkajou left a trail for Glory to follow. As Kinkajou and Icicle were fighting in the abandoned Night Kingdom, Glory tranquilized the IceWing with eight other dragons (seven RainWings and Deathbringer) and took her back to the RainWing village, announcing her arrested. As Winter was arguing with Qibli when the SandWing offered to help save Winter's brother, Hailstorm, Glory tells Winter that she felt the same way that he did then: that she could have done everything by herself and did not need anyone else, but that he would appreciate his friends' help later on. She reluctantly permits the group to leave, strictly ordering Moon and Kinkajou not to die, calling them "two of my favorite subjects."

   Glory did not know Tamarin that well (other than Kinkajou talking about her), other than the fact that she was blind. Tamarin seemed confident in front of Glory when she said that maybe she could not do the flower challenge, with Kinkajou later stating that Tamarin had the best nose in the whole kingdom. At first, Glory doubted her abilities, but when Tamarin won the flower hunt in the RainWing queen challenge, she began to see that she was a skilled dragonet, despite her blindness. She also felt compassionate about getting Tamarin a better teacher at Jade Mountain Academy.
