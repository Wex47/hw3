   The palace consists of towers, turrets, and spires
   that seemed to grow out of gray-black rocks, and every ledge was an entrance to caves and holes carved out of the mountainside.
   The tallest spire is the chimney of the crematorium, which carried the smoke of burning bodies.
   The second tallest spire is a lookout area for the guards near the outer wall of the palace. At the top of the tower was a small pavilion with room for five or six dragons to fit comfortably. A shallow hole in the floor was intended as a fire pit, for heating the tower when it was cold or for cooking prey. The walls were open on all sides, but the position of the tower was directed west, to watch for attacks from

   Gold traces, talon prints, and outlines of flames and clouds are carved in the stone of the floor, and Ex-Queen Scarlet's throne room was said to contain massive amounts of gold in it, giving it the oppressive heat of a funeral pyre.

   The Great Hall is the main chamber of the SkyWing palace, with multiple levels of it leading to many different rooms and balconies. It has no roof, with an airborne battlefield keep with ringside boulders as seats instead. The roof let out onto a rocky mountaintop with dizzying views of peaks all around them; small little scrub bushes clung to the dirt here and there, but mostly it was all rocks — long overlapping shelves of gray rock and lumps of boulders like giant stone eggs. The Great Hall is often busy with dragons hopping across the great space, exchanging small message scrolls in midair, carrying buckets of water, clean animal skins, or platters of food, and dodging wings as tails as they went.

   The top level of the Great Hall used to reverberate with the shrieks of burning dragons and roars of the arena, but has changed to become a place for SkyWings to dance, sing, celebrate, and party in Ruby's reign. There is a prison at the bottom of the Great Hall, where Scarlet kept her least favorite prisoners. It consists of thick metal bars and chains to hold prisoners in place. Peril burned a hole through the prison as of

   The SkyWing arena is directly outside of the palace, in the northern Sky Kingdom. Prisoners of war were forced to fight to the death here for Scarlet's entertainment. Scarlet kept various competitors, including scavengers, dragons, and other creatures. The dragon prisoners mainly consisted of IceWings,
   SeaWings
   , and SandWings who were loyal to those other than Queen Scarlet or

   The burliest dragons had been assigned guard in the throne room every day during Scarlet's reign. The floor and walls were inlaid with gold so that the room, on a sunny day, was so bright it could instantly give a dragon a headache. The gold was removed after Ruby became queen. It has two thrones: one for the queen, a carved column shaped like clouds, and a guest throne, which is smaller than the queen's throne. It was often occupied by Burn during the war.

   This tower is where SkyWing dragonets live until they can fly competently. The tower's bottom is covered in rugs and toy weapons, like spears and shields, for the youngest dragonets to play with. The middle section has many perches to sit on and navigate, and the topmost area is full of obstacle courses for the older dragonets to practice flying and turning sharp corners in mid-air. The only decoration is a portrait of Scarlet five times the actual size of her. It covered a huge swathe of wall, forcing dragonets to climb up or flap around it. Scarlet's perfect orange scales, bright yellow eyes, and cascades of jewelry towered over the wingery, as if she were approving of their play but also imprinting their young minds with the constant reminder that she was the queen and always would be.
