   Cricket prefers that everything fits together and makes sense, like the books that she reads. She relies on facts in books and reason to navigate the world around her. For this reason, she is very fond of nonfiction novels.
   She is often full of questions,
   and when she feels simultaneous fear and curiosity, curiosity often wins.

   She is hopeful,

   Cricket refuses to harm innocent dragons,
   and wants to know many things about the world around her.
   She sometimes feels awkward and out of step with other dragons, and finds conversation to be difficult,
   as she understands science more than she understands emotion.
   She cannot read facial expressions very well,
   and dislikes socializing,

      Cricket made her first appearance when she helped Blue, a young SilkWing, by pulling him into a shed that was hidden from the eyes of the pursuing HiveWings. After being asked by a rather confused and scared Blue, Cricket admitted that, for an unknown reason, she could not be mind-controlled by Queen Wasp like the rest of her tribe was.
      <p key="b295fc61-1d7d-4bca-9223-2c3103fdc2f5">
       After escaping through tunnels located under the HiveWing school, Cricket brought Blue to an empty low-level library, where he began to feel dizzy. Cricket speculated that the HiveWings had probably injected him with a barb covered in sleeping toxin within his armband, most likely implemented to make him easier to capture. After Cricket burned off Blue's armband with a strand of flamesilk belonging to one of the library's lamps, he fell into a woozy sleep.
      </p>
      <p key="9d347cb1-35c4-46f4-bd16-7a27032992c7">
       He woke up to Cricket's talons shaking him awake and voices echoing nearby. Cricket and Blue hid in the tunnels once again while three mind-controlled HiveWings searched the area; one of them was Cricket's mother,
       Katydid
       , and another was an arrogant dragon named
       Bombardier
       , who falsely believed that Cricket was madly in love with him. After the HiveWing trio had cleared the library, Cricket and Blue emerged into the light once more, where Cricket pulled a book off of a high shelf. From the book, they learned that if a SilkWing had one flamesilk parent, then they had a fifty percent chance of becoming a flamesilk as well. Leaving the library, Cricket led Blue through the school — she showed him her terrarium, where a little tree was growing in the middle. She explained that she had found its seed on one of her school gathering trips and that she had not known what it was until it started growing. Cricket then told Blue that Professor
       Earthworm
       , a teacher at the school, wanted her to uproot it and throw it away. Next, Cricket took Blue into an art room, where she began to paint him with a mixture of dull browns, reds, and dark blues to hide his vibrant and recognizable scales. They bonded a little in a moment where Cricket told Blue about how Principal
       Lubber
       scolded her for her chaotic yet beautiful art. "Cricket, why can't you just draw a normal blue blueberry like all the other dragonets?" Blue imitated Principal Lubber, making Cricket laugh, saying: "That's exactly what she sounds like!"

      <p key="336ee935-ac14-4f9f-9e5e-2090c98050ef">
       Once they were out of the school, Cricket agreed to help rescue Blue's friend
       <a href="Swordtail.html" key="e2e365d0-f414-4260-9d75-d103db629b2f" title="Swordtail">

       from
       Misbehaver's Way
       . They found him frozen to his pedestal in an angry position, as if he was trying to fight his way out of being paralyzed, but in vain. Cricket held a bubbling, green vial under Swordtail's nose to combat the HiveWing paralysis toxin, but the mixture also turned Swordtail's eyes and silk green, gave him extra strength, and made him a little loopy. After Swordtail smashed one of the rule tablets straight through the Hive's treestuff, Cricket decided it was time to go. Wrapping Blue's shoulders in a few strands of silk, Swordtail grabbed him and lifted off. They flew for most of the night, and by dawn, they were almost at the border of
       Wasp Hive
       . Eventually, they stopped and hid in a massive divot in the ground, flying to the bottom and down a tunnel, where they discovered a small pool of cold water. At the other end of the pool, they spotted a small campfire and a tiny, book-reading creature that resembled a monkey, presumably similar to Pyrrhia's
       <a class="mw-redirect" href="Scavengers.html" key="9f805a49-ff15-4dcc-95f2-856654691069" title="Scavengers">
        scavengers
       </a>
       . After the monkey creature was scared away by Cricket's voice, they lost interest, and Swordtail passed out near the fire, leaving Blue to take the first watch while Cricket slept. When night fell again, Swordtail tried to lift Blue but failed because the stimulant had worn off and there was none left. Cricket eventually came up with the idea for Blue to climb up the chasm with Swordtail's silk wrapped around him in case he slipped and fell. Near the top of the divot, Cricket and Blue eventually found a small cave, where they curled up together and Blue got some much-needed rest while Swordtail returned to the bottom of the divot. After the HiveWing parties had stopped searching near the hole, Swordtail flew on ahead while Cricket and Blue crawled through the savannah's tall grass.

       When they finally crept into Wasp Hive, they hid in one of the queen's greenhouses. Unexpectedly, they were soon captured by three strange dragons — who, terrifyingly, turned out to be LeafWings, the supposedly cruel and deadly enemies of the HiveWings. The LeafWings introduced themselves as Sundew,
       Belladonna
       , and
       <a href="Hemlock.html" key="2beb2f0c-a359-49cf-969e-c731d353324d" title="Hemlock">
        Hemlock
       </a>
       . They explained that if Cricket, Blue, and Swordtail wanted to live, they would steal the
       Book of Clearsight
       and return it to them. Cricket's impulse was to leave once the LeafWings had let them go, but Belladonna sent Sundew with them to ensure the job got done. Disguising Sundew as a SilkWing, Hemlock rubbed flower juice on her scales to add more color. Belladonna also tied two makeshift wings made of leaves to Sundew's back, instructing her to keep her real ones folded to make them appear more realistic. While Swordtail stayed with Belladona and Hemlock, Cricket, Blue, and Sundew went out into the Hive to finish their task. Sundew gave Cricket a large flower, instructing her not to crush any part of it until she was close enough to the guards. Cricket held it under the noses of the two HiveWings guarding the entrance to Wasp Hive, leaving them unconscious but alive. Entering through two heavy wooden doors, they walked down a series of hallways until they were standing at the foot of the Temple.
      </p>
      <p key="dd2e23ae-3869-4348-a8ea-764212208831">
       Once inside, Blue and Sundew acted as Cricket's servants until Sundew got close enough to the guards to paralyze them. In the final room, Sundew was confronted by a dark voice, which turned out to be the
       Librarian
       's. After she ripped off her dark veil, Cricket realized the HiveWing's eyes were fully white — the unmistakable symbol of the queen's mind control. Sundew attacked the Librarian from her side, and the two fought while Blue picked up the bookcase key the Librarian had dropped and unlocked the container to steal the Book. After Sundew had broken the Librarian's arm, she speculated that enough pain would make the queen desert the HiveWing's mind for a while, because the queen felt everything that a dragon felt when she mind-controlled them. Sundew then directed Cricket to open a jar and shake a pair of
       onto the Librarian's scales. After they bit her, the queen abandoned her control, and the Librarian's mind was her own for the first time in years. However, hundreds of brainwashed HiveWings were now surrounding the Temple with the intent to kill Cricket and Sundew and imprison Blue. The Librarian attempted to help them escape, but Wasp invaded her mind again, causing her to turn against her new companions. Cricket and Sundew were unable to help Blue as he fell into the waiting talons of the HiveWings and fled once Blue had thrown the Book of Clearsight into Cricket's talons.
      </p>
      <p key="805f1cb8-b544-4f55-ba7a-0fdc189572f9">
       After a few days trapped in the flamesilk factory, Blue felt talons brush him through a hole in the building's wall. These were Cricket's talons, and she appeared, accompanied by Sundew and Swordtail. After grabbing
       Luna
       — who had emerged from her cocoon — and trying to convince his father,
       Admiral
       , to go with them, Blue attempted to leave. However, Admiral refused to escape and tried to alert the watching HiveWing guards. Fortunately,
       Danaid
       , another of the imprisoned flamesilks, helped them by starting an argument that covered the noise of Admiral's warning. Knocking down the loose stones around the hole, Blue and Luna escaped with Cricket and the others down a series of tunnels. These led to another set of tunnels, built by the LeafWings, and took them all the way to the sea. When they emerged and saw the ocean, Cricket was ecstatic and began to express a hope at finding the Distant Kingdoms (the Pantalan name for Pyrrhia). Afterward, she showed the others what was written in the Book of Clearsight, including the fact that the last vision recorded took place over a thousand years before.
      </p>
      Luna and Swordtail then decided to go for a flight, and Cricket stayed with Blue, discussing his metamorphosis and assuring him that it will be fine. Meanwhile, Luna and Swordtail were discovered by some HiveWing soldiers, and a fight started. As Sundew rushed to help, Cricket was left with Blue, who was about to start his metamorphosis. She guided him to a cave she found to hide in while he changed and stayed with him while he began to spin his cocoon, promising him that she will be right there "the whole time" and will be next to him when he wakes up, which she does.

      Cricket stood in the cave next to Blue in his cocoon, thinking about books and what her life was like before she met Blue. Sundew then entered the cave, dragging Swordtail with her. Cricket recalled Sundew's bravery and ferocity, along with the fact that she had insisted that they rescued Blue and Luna. She wondered if this was a form of kindness Sundew had hidden deep in her soul.
      <p key="707752d1-aab5-4838-a122-b49876d7ded7">
       Cricket revived Swordtail with a plant Sundew gave her, and Swordtail immediately asked where Luna was. Both Cricket and Sundew had no idea, and they all seemed to wish she was there with them. When Swordtail noticed that Blue was a flamesilk, Sundew noted that Blue would be useful to burn down the Hives. Swordtail seemed to like the idea, but Cricket was firmly against this, and she knew Blue would be as well. Cricket argued that even HiveWings could be on their side, but none of them seemed to agree with this idea. Swordtail then revealed the Chrysalis, a secret organization of SilkWings who fought for freedom.

       Cricket insisted on finding information before jumping into action, so they flew toward
       Jewel Hive
       to find out more about the Chrysalis and Queen Wasp's Hive Mind. First, however, they visited the Glitterbazaar to disguise themselves, making it easier to get into the Hive. They met up with three members of the
       Chrysalis
       , but they did not seem to know much about taking down Queen Wasp quite like Sundew, Cricket, and Swordtail had hoped. But they did learn about how there was supposed to be a place full of dragons in Teste Hive, that were supposed to be immune to Wasp's mind control.

       However, Cricket met up with her sister, Katydid, who questioned her about her theft of the Book of Clearsight. Katydid did not seem to follow what she was saying, though she did reveal that she was in fact

       Cricket's sister, and Scarab later said that her father was a HiveWing named
       Malachite
       , who, according to Lady Scarab, was "brilliant, talented, made excellent coffee, full of exciting ideas." Queen Wasp found out that Scarab was fond of him, so she had him "promoted" to work at her Hive, and he was probably forever condemned to her mind control. Scarab explained that she attempts to pretend she does not care so that one day Malachite would be free from the mind control. After Malachite's disappearance, Katydid crept Cricket's egg into the hatchery with a forged identity as Katydid's sister. Cricket also gets many answers on why her "mother" (who was her grandmother) hated her, and why Katydid was the one who always took care of her.
      </p>
      <p key="93c3fa18-0bbe-4629-b93c-5f92ac047e7f">
       Cricket, Sundew, and Swordtail borrowed one of Lady Scarab's paintbrushes to create posters about Wasp and how she was lying to everyone. A lot of dragons seemed intrigued, and some of them seemed to believe the posters, but in the middle of her attempt, Cricket got caught by HiveWing guards. She was paralyzed, unable to say another word against the queen. The guards put her into a prison cell, where Lady Scarab and
       Jewel
       found her. Lady Jewel confirmed the theory that she is immune to Wasp's mind control, but once saw Wasp make other dragons submit to her control. Lady Jewel and Lady Scarab were fighting a lot, but it was revealed that the purpose Lady Jewel has a library is because of Queen Wasp's terrible school curriculum. Cricket heard that Queen Wasp was going into the hatchery that night, and Cricket decided to follow her to find the truth about her mind control.
      </p>
      Cricket escaped from the cell by utilizing the flamesilk and burning a hole in the ceiling. Tau and Cinnabar help her escape (members of the Chrysalis she had met in the library). It is uncovered that Tau has a crush on a HiveWing who is Lady Jewel's treasurer, and by distracting him, Cinnabar helped Cricket escape moments before Queen Wasp arrived. After that, she crept into the hatchery and noticed an orphaned egg she sympathized, and took it with her as she hid in the rafters. She watched as Queen Wasp entered and proceeded to stab each egg with her tail stinger, marking each egg afterward. When Queen Wasp left, Cricket took the egg with her and rendezvoused with Blue, Swordtail, and Sundew. She camped with them outside Jewel Hive, and in the morning, the egg hatched. On the shell of the egg was an odorous green substance that Sundew said belonged to a plant in the greenhouse where she and Cricket first met — Queen Wasp's private greenhouse. They decided to go burn the greenhouse down, but as they did, they noticed
      Bloodworm Hive
      burning as well. Cricket convinced the others that the HiveWings were too busy with the destruction to worry about the greenhouse, so Blue used his flamesilk to burn it down. Once the greenhouse was burning, Blue, Swordtail, and Cricket left with Sundew to go to the

Then he told them that he had given the vine to Queen Wasp at a peace summit and had slipped it in her food, but he had the cure that could save the HiveWings and Katydid.

When Snowfall fainted from her vision of Blue, Cricket arrived as one of the dragons watching her when she woke up. Cricket stuttered that Snowfall's expression was weirdly familiar, referring to Blue. She examined Snowfall's jewelries and said that Blue would have loved the interesting magic, until Snowfall boldly told her the events of the vision.

   Even after escaping Cicada Hive and becoming a fugitive with Blue, Cricket knew that she had no regrets about what she had done.
   She is instinctively protective of him,

   and they are quite affectionate towards one another.
   He is a great source of comfort for her,

   Blue's smile takes up a lot of space in her heart, and while she cares for him romantically, she is unsure if he feels the same, and chastises herself for feeling so affectionate towards him.
   She likes to laugh and talk with him, and wishes she could tell their society that she thinks he is wonderful, important, interesting, and valuable.
   He understands Cricket,

   When Cricket thinks about Cadelle, she feels a familiar twist like thorns around her heart.

   She once cried herself to sleep, wondering why Cadelle had taken Katydid to dinner and left Cricket behind.
   Cadelle would often remark that Cricket was 'no daughter of mine,'
   and according to Scarab, Cadelle wanted to destroy Cricket's egg as soon as she discovered that Katydid had a daughter.
   After discovering that Cadelle and her husband were not her true parents, Cricket understood that because her own existence was against Pantalan law, and because she represented Katydid's lie, that Cadelle must have only seen danger, crime, disorder, and lies that could ruin her life every time she look at Cricket.
