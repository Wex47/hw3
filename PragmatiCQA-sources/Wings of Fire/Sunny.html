   a small head,

   Despite having scales that radiate warmth,

  <p key="2d2e7177-6998-4bde-833b-70c31f1b4fb5">
   Sunny often attempts to be stern,
   but she is easy-to-laugh,
   sympathetic,
   reassuring,
   unambitious,
   agreeable,
   and wants to believe the best in every dragon.
   She dislikes when her friends argue,
   and she is passionate and disapproving of violence.
   She does not memorize facts with ease,
   and is often seen by other dragons as cute,
   sweet, simple, and lovable.
   Externally, it did not seem as though Sunny ever had negative thoughts; she did what she was told, and happily. She believes the best of everyone, and she would never hurt or betray anyone: sentiments that sometimes make others doubt her judgement and intelligence.
   She is delighted when she is tasked with importance,
   and often dislikes how others perceive her to be simple and sweet.

  <p key="a65fd157-9150-4520-a7b4-39606308c65e">
   Sunny truly cared about fulfilling the Dragonet Prophecy,
   even after it was confirmed to be fake. She has an excitable, bright, bubbly, empathetic, cheerful, good-natured, kind-hearted, and optimistic personality. In

   with evil intentions and believes that beneath every seemingly bad dragon is always a backstory or a reason to be that way.

She dislikes violence and tries to solve most problems peacefully when possible. Sunny is also quite empathetic and forgiving; even though

This could mean that Dune still respected, cared about, or was even loyal to Thorn, despite taking her egg to fulfill the dragonet prophecy. Although, in

She is said to be the last hatched, and upon hatching, she was revealed to have neither a venomous barb on her tail nor pale, sandy, yellow scales as a normal SandWing should have. She also lacked the usual black SandWing eyes, as her eyes are a green-gray color, which is leading to the assumption she was taken from the sand earlier than the right time, but this was proven to be false upon the revelation that Sunny is a SandWing-NightWing hybrid, with her father being Stonemover, a NightWing

Darkstalker also says that Sunny is related to him because her father, Stonemover, is animus and that he is also her "great-great-great-a lot of greats-great uncle." After some talk, Sunny goes back inside. The next day, she heads up the tunnel with a squirrel for Darkstalker. Moon tells her someone is trying to kill Stonemover and she flies to this cave with the others. She feels heartbroken at her father's near-death and starts sobbing. Then, she jumps on him to pin his talon when Darkstalker frees him from the stone. After Stonemover is re-fossilized, Sunny hugs him, not caring about the blood. She is astonished when they find out Flame was the attempted killer. She asks him why he did it, and why his reason would matter. She also says they have to tell Queen Ruby what he did and that they did not have anywhere to lock him up for the time being. When all of the drama is over, she slips away into the tunnels.
