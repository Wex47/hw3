She thought back to what happened during the time before her attempted sacrifice, and back to all of the times the people in Talisman had done her wrong. Eventually, she comes across a dragonet for the first time, who was tangled in a bush and close to death. Wren helps him out of pity and then talks to him to reassure him that he was safe and to help herself calm down. As they are talking, a rust-colored dragon with yellow eyes and a recent burn on its cheek flies by, and Wren presumes it was hunting. Wren hides herself and him from the unknown dragon (

Daffodil spoke to her grandmother, Valor's oldest resident, who (according to Daffodil) spent the meeting criticizing Daffodil's clothing. Her grandmother also denied having seen the treasure since the day Heath and Stone brought it back. Ivy searched her home thoroughly but found no sign of the treasure. The girls met in Violet's cave and wondered where the treasure could be if it was not in the Dragonslayer's home. Ivy realized the old village would be the perfect place and would explain why he had banned going there.

   Leaf was taken to a kitchen full of frantic dragons. He noticed the dragons show emotions, similar to humans, which confused him greatly. There are "approximately eight hundred zillion dragons" who want to eat him. He saw the massive amount of treasure, and realized they might have been able to steal some. Leaf was dumped in the middle of a party with other terrified animals and quickly had to avoid being eaten. He found Thyme and helped him to hide under a table, but Leaf wanted to get back to Rowan. He snuck away from the party and began to climb a cliff. He climbed for most of the night but ultimately collapsed on a ledge. In the morning, Leaf tried to climb further but was too exhausted. He did not get far before he was scooped up by a brown dragon (Clay) and deposited at the top of the cliff.

   Ivy, Daffodil, and Violet show Stone the sapphire. He says Heath did not like it because it gave him nightmares about the dragons, and was likely the only thing that made him feel guilty. Suddenly, the Dragonslayer enters, and Ivy hides the gem under blankets. Foxglove lies and says they were caught out in the rain and they came to visit Stone, as he was close by. He tells them they should not leave the caves. Ivy notices her father is acting strangely. He leaves the house and tells both Ivy and her mother not to leave. Ivy realizes her mother does not give Heath "hero-worship eyes" anymore. Her mother tells her the lord of the Indestructible City wants Heath to work on them. Ivy knows her father never will, as he enjoys being lord too much, and is secretly a coward. Ivy convinces her mother to go to the meeting even though her father told her not to. Daffodil and Violet arrive and announce they will search the place even though Ivy already has. Daffodil asks how she lives with the tail barb, and Ivy says she avoids it. They realize she also avoided it while searching. They discovered the pedestal was secretly a safe, with a four-letter combination. The girls guess every four-letter word they can think of relating to dragons and treasure, but none of them work. Lark, Rose, and Ivy's also do not work. They try the word mine, and it does open. They do not touch the treasure, instead, shutting the safe again until they work out their plan.

Ivy then introduces Leaf to her father. He gives Heath a message from the Indestructible City, not realizing it is a threat. He is then sent away.

They agree never to mention each other again. Wren begins her search for Sky. She was seen by dragons a few times, but they seemed not to mind her presence. She also heard a dragon shouting loud, violent threats. She thought the tower containing the roaring dragon could be where prisoners were kept, but when food was brought in there was only enough for one dragon. She found the soldier's barracks. General Sandstorm entered and shouted for Prince Smolder, asking when Queen Burn would return and he could give Sky to her. Wren noticed the general was giving orders to a Prince, which seemed strange to her. From what the dragon had said she knew he was keeping Sky alive. She noticed most dragons seemed annoyed by Sandstorm. She followed him to where Sky was and waited for him to leave, then ran to Sky. She cannot release him without the general's key, so decides she will have to kill him.

They race after the dragon to see her shout at Smolder, who shrugs and points to Rose in the corner. Stone rejoices over finding Rose alive and asks her why the other dragon did not eat him, and Rose says that she probably thought Stone was her, and brought him to yell at Smolder, not realizing that Rose was with Smolder and she had picked up a wild human instead.

Stone argues that the dragons cannot be trusted, but Rose replies "What makes you think humans can?" Stone retorts that the dragons had burned down the village, and Ivy says she thinks they were looking for something, and Rose deduces that it is in one of the bags she put the treasure in, two of which Stone and Heath had left behind.

After Sky growls at them again, Gorge tosses the keys to Wren and she give it to Cranberry, who unlocks the door before throwing them up to Leaf, where he also unlocks the jail and frees Rowan and Grove. Cranberry then emerges from the house with the logbook in hand, giving it to Wren, where Wren reads and explains its contents to the entire village. After reading the last book, Wren says that she does not care what happens to the dragonmancers, but she threatens to burn down the village and take the children somewhere safe if any more of the kids go missing. She then gives the book to Butterfly and puts him in charge, having had enough of Tailsman. As the group was about to leave, Leaf and Wren's parents try to talk to them, but Wren tells them off and the others ignore them. The group moves away from Tailsman and stop by the river a while later. Grove wonders what they were all going to do now. Leaf and Wren propose that they would build a town where people that had their villages burned down would be welcomed and be protected. Ivy also says they can tell them that they can communicate with dragons and that there's hope for peace. Cranberry and Rowan agree to the idea, although Rowan wonders whether Leaf, Wren, and Ivy would help build it with them. Wren and Leaf say that they will help when they come back after they try out a new idea for their destiny. Ivy adds that they "have a little golden dragon to find."

   The epilogue for this book is set in the point of view of Undauntable. He was looking outside his window hoping that Wren would come back to the Indestructible City. It was around fifty-nine days since he proposed to Wren, who did not accept it and stormed away from him. He was worried that maybe she was killed by a dragon. He even wondered what would happen if he ran away with her, only to dismiss that idea because it was much safer inside the walls of The Indestructible City. His father then found him and beckoned for him to follow. Once he did, his father said that the spy, Boar, who was sent into Valor to become a close guard to him, said that Heath was not the actual Dragonslayer and that Stone was, but Stone was a lost cause. He then said he had very 'interesting news.' The news was about a girl who could speak Dragon and had a dragon who she controls (Sky). Undauntable realized that this is Wren. He was terrified for her, admitting that he does love her because she was everything the Indestructible City was not. He attempted to lie, for his father listened to

   say the dragon's scales were a pale orange, which was the same color of the scales Wren had given him during her visits. His father could tell he was lying and ends the epilogue by saying that he will control Wren and take over the world. The book also ends with Undauntable swearing he will protect Wren for as long as he can.
