Suddenly, Yuji shows up by crashing through a window and manages to rescue his friends, Megumi uses this chance to exorcise the spirit.

This greatly annoys both Megumi and Nobara for mocking their friend's demise. Aoi then says that he wants to test them out, and asks what type of girl is Megumi's type, then he explains why he asked that. Megumi gives an answer that Aoi doesn't like, which causes Aoi to attack him. Megumi tries to attack with his shikigamis but Aoi easily overpowers him. Megumi manages to restrain Aoi but Panda and Toge show up to stop the fight. Aoi later leaves with Mai, much to the annoyance of Megumi.

Someone asks why Kenjaku didn't use their barrier at that time in Japan into sorcerers via

Tengen confirms that they are indeed one person but due to them having evolved over the past 11 years, it would not be impossible for them to merge with someone other than a Star Plasma Vessel.

Tengen explains that they possess barrier techniques which enable them to maintain their current form and self control even after evolving. They add on that if humankind evolves and only one person rages out, the world will end. Yuki asks them why who says that the impurities of a hundred million people would flood the world, which what happened to Tokyo would happen to the entire world as well.

They add on that there are 10 colonies around Japan and are connected by a barrier that sends humans in Japan to the other side. Yuki asks if Hokkaido isn't included because of the jujutsu society's barrier which Tengen confirms and includes that it's already established as vast sacred area.

Tengen says that there aren't any rules that entering or exiting a colonies and adds that players are given a clear objective of exiting the barrier. They add on in order to confine the players, the premise that they entered of their own free will is important. Rule 5 of the Culling Game is revealed where sorcerers are worth 5 points whereas non-sorcerers are worth 1 point. Yuji comments on how it seems a bit vague. Megumi asks about the "game master" which Tengen tells them that each player will receive a shikigami that's called a Kogane.

Yuji is disappointed that he will be forced to kill people again as Megumi tells him that he has a few ideas.

Megumi makes an example for Yuji which is that they're like the cops and Kinji's the robber. As they head towards the underground battle area, Yuji wonders if they're on jujutsu high's side where Megumi responds by saying that's a gray area but in Kinji's eyes, they might as well be.

Remaining calm, Megumi says they need money and to allow them to join the fight. The guard who threatened to clobber them throws a fake punch at Megumi as a threat before saying that rule one is no one says anything about the club and to tell him who told them the information or he'll beat them up. Megumi, effortlessly lies by saying that he didn't get his name before he killed him, adding on that it was about a month ago and comments on how much of a scumbag they were, being so full of themselves.
   Megumi tells the guard to let him take his place or he'll beat them in front of the bookie. Just then, the other guards tells them off and that the boss said it's okay and says they'll throw him in today as today's seeded fighter but Yuji is the one who has to fight. Megumi says it has to be himself but thinks about how Yuji is better suited for that as the guard tells him that the boss doesn't like Megumi and if he doesn't like it then the deal's over.

Megumi tells Yuji that he'll join the fights and get a look from the inside while he possibly sneak into the parking garage. Yuji is confused by Megumi's "maybe" who says that he thinks they want to see what he's up to and says that if they catch him trying to sneak in, there's no chance of getting them to trust Yuji and that they won't be able to meet Kinji. Yuji comments on how if that were to happen they can just use force which Megumi agrees but only as a last resort. Megumi says that they've only come to request Kinji's cooperation and that he wants to avoid anything that might have a lasting effect on relations. Megumi says he should lie low tonight but he doesn't want to waste any more time before Tsumiki's deadline to declare participation in the
   Culling Game
   Yuji says that right now it's five p.m. on the tenth which leaves them with only nine days.

   Megumi comments on how it took longer than what he thought to get this far: getting to where transportation is still running and stopping along the way to beat cursed spirits. He says he'll sneak in to look for Kinji but if things get dicey he's out which is what he meant by "maybe" which Yuji tells him he understands.
   Hiding in the shadows, Megumi listens to someone asking about what to do with the "other kid" which is referring to Megumi which Kinji tells them to stay vigilant and that Kirara will provide security as well.

   Waiting for Panda in a forest, Panda eventually finds Megumi where Panda asks if he thinks Yuji can meet up with Kinji which Megumi confirms but asks Panda why haven't he met with Kinji yet. Panda says that he knows where he is and that Kinji's always in the monitor room on the roof but he can't get close which generates a why not from Megumi.
   Panda says that it doesn't matter if he walks or run towards the door on the roof as the distance never decreases and it feels somewhat like Gojo's cursed technique. He says that it's probably Kirara's cursed technique but he isn't sure. Megumi asks if the other third-year is a boy where Panda confirms this. Megumi asks if that phenomenon only occur when Kirara is in the monitor room but Panda says he isn't sure as Kinji and Kirara are never apart. Panda tells Megumi that instead of trying too hard and scaring off Kinji, he decided to attract spectators like a circus bear and thankfully Megumi and Yuji showed up. Megumi says he isn't sure and asks Panda if he thinks Yuji can convince Kinji. Panda says it might be hard as the problem is more on Kinji rather than Yuji and adds on that he thinks it might just be a matter of time.

   Panda says that Yuji is very friendly and charming which should work on Kinji but he sucks at lying. Megumi says lying isn't really an option for Yuji but he did give him some pointers and says the worst case scenario, Kinji realizes Yuji is from jujutsu high and tosses him out without listening or calls in some bruisers. Panda comes to the conclusion that as soon as Yuji gets in, they should seize control of the area and guard the door so they can talk. Megumi is a bit hesitant on the idea but Panda reassures him that he won't kill anyone and he'll only knock them out. Megumi says that there are security cameras and if the negotiations happens in the monitor room, they'd see anything they would do.
   Panda says that he's aware of the camera positions and blind spots and says it won't be a problem if anyone sees him. Megumi thinks Panda's plan might work who says that the only serious sorcerers are Kinji and Kirara. Megumi asks about how many lookouts there are and Panda says that there are four at the entrance and two on every floor but the roof. Panda says he's concerned about Kirara's cursed technique but they can't do anything about that and if they warp Yuji outside or bring in some muscle, they'll have to give up on Kinji.

   With their plan in progress, Megumi comes out of one of the lookout's shadows and knocks him out before binding them. Megumi does this to another guard while Panda acts like a careless bear playing with a tire.
   Megumi is already on the rooftop as Panda arrives as Megumi asks will things be alright and wonders if this won't cause trouble later. Panda reassures him that it's okay and the two prepares to guard the door, Kirara walks out and spots Panda, blowing their cover.
   Kirara pulls out their phone but Megumi summons
   <a href="Divine Dog Totality.html" key="dac7f9ec-4032-4afd-ae7d-9f303e62d763" title="Divine Dog: Totality">
    Divine Dog: Totality
   </a>
   who only manages to knock the phone out of Kirara's hand before being flung back towards Megumi. Megumi is confused and wonders if his Divine Dog was repelled but thinks back to what Panda said is true, then Divine Dog just couldn't get close.
   While Panda is chasing over Kirara telling them that they only have a request for Kinji, Megumi sends Divine Dog to the monitor room's entrance but gets pulled along and crashes into his shikigami. Megumi thinks about how they can't get close but there's more to it, as he and Divine Dog can't separate.
