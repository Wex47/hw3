   Yuta is involved in an incident where four students were seriously injured.

During his isolation, Yuta tries to kill himself, but Rika stops him from doing so.

   , which all three notice that Yuta is cursed. The three prepare to attack Yuta, which confuses Yuta. Gojo explains to Yuta what this college is and what they teach. Gojo also warns the three, which Rika appears and defends Yuta. Gojo then explains Yuta's situation to the class. Gojo also introduces the class to Yuta, and that they will be pairing up to today's lesson. Yuta is paired up with Maki, where Yuta has trouble with her.
  </p>
  <p key="7a3b4214-9393-45b3-8075-66321b5efaa4">
   Gojo brings Yuta and Maki to an elementary school where two children have been taken by spirits. Gojo explains to Yuta how cursed spirits are created, and leaves them to handle the problem after putting up a screen. When three spirits appear, Yuta is amazed as Maki exorcises them all. As they head inside, Yuta is worried about the spirits that are dwelling in the school, while Maki notices that the spirits are not attacking them. Maki wonders if it is because of Yuta, and asks to see his student ID. Maki is distracted when she finds out that Yuta is a special-grade sorcerer as Yuta tells Maki that there is a spirit behind her.
  </p>
  <p key="251c1a99-b1f7-4dd7-98f8-1e2d1271a6be">
   Yuta and Maki are then devoured by the spirit, which results in them finding the missing children. Maki suddenly falls to the ground as Yuta wonders what to do. Maki asks him why he came to the college, to which Yuta answers, explaining he "wants the confidence to be able to live." Maki encourages Yuta to exorcise the spirit, which causes Yuta to put on the ring that Rika gave to him and has Rika attack the spirit. Once Yuta and the others are freed, Yuta carries them to the exit. As Yuta is about to fall over, Rika's spirit encourages him to continue on, which gives Yuta enough willpower to reach the exit.
  </p>
  <p key="fa5c0ef1-03d0-4e53-937e-e096231d2fc9">
   After the incident, Yuta is at a hospital with Gojo where Maki and the children are being treated. Yuta talks with Gojo about how this was the first time that he had summoned Rika, and says that he remembers when he made the promise with Rika. Yuta also says that he believes he was the one that had cursed Rika, and vows to find a way to release Rika from the curse. Afterwards, Yuta is given a katana by Gojo, who explains to Yuta how he can break the curse that is on Rika by imbuing the tool with the energy of the curse, bit by bit.
  </p>
  <p key="87ea1ea6-aa1a-4b85-a9b4-61144c7d4069">
   Three months later, Yuta is training with Maki as Panda, Toge, and Gojo watch. Gojo assigns a mission to Toge which Yuta will accompany him. Gojo then explains what Toge's ability is and that Yuta is to observe Toge without bringing out Rika.
  </p>
  <p key="408cdad6-5244-46e6-9d2a-9d332ce1e820">
   Yuta and Toge are then driven to the Hapina Shopping district by

   . Once they arrive, Ijichi begins to explain the mission. Yuta and Ijichi notice that Toge has headed off to buy throat medicine. Yuta and Toge then head into the shopping district, and Yuta watches as Toge easily exorcises the spirits. As they leave, Yuta and Toge notice that the screen has not been raised. Suddenly, a powerful spirit appears and attacks them. Toge moves Yuta out of the way and uses his ability to twist the spirit's arm. Toge then suddenly begins to cough, requiring Yuta to save him from the spirit's attack and bring him to safety. However, during this encounter they lose the throat medicine.
  </p>
  <p key="3c8112a1-d7bd-448a-a9c5-91c1b614d13b">
   After resting for a bit, Toge decides to go face the spirit. Yuta decides to accompany him, despite Toge's insistence. As Yuta approaches the spirit, the spirit notices Rika's presence and becomes furious. Yuta manages to dodge some of the spirit's attacks and is able to land a blow on the curse. Yuta notices that he can't defeat the spirit and quickly throws the throat medicine, which had been resting on the floor to Toge. Toge takes the medicine and uses his ability to crush the curse. Afterwards, the two celebrate with a high-five. At some point during this altercation, Yuta drops his student identification card, which is picked up by

   Afterwards Yuta and Toge head back to the college. Yuta meets with Panda, who explains how Toge is a nice guy and that Toge was worried about Yuta since their situation are similar. Yuta then goes to train with Maki, which he asks her how to pour curse power into his sword but she has no idea due to her having no cursed energy.
  </p>
  <p key="b4d69a1b-3f91-43ca-81cf-55d78d6b2016">
   Days later, Yuta is with Toge, Panda, and Maki when Geto and his comrades show up. Geto quickly introduces himself to Yuta and begins to explain his reason for wanting to kill everyone who is not a sorcerer. Yuta then becomes angry with Geto when he starts to insult his friends. As the faculty come and try to force Geto out of the college, Geto announces a date and location for

  </p>
  <p key="9f0f872f-283f-4819-ad91-295fc792f09a">
   On December 24, Yuta is in the classroom when Maki shows up. The two start to talk, causing Maki to explain her situation and how she plans to head back to the Zenin family and become its head one day. Yuta says how he want to become someone like Maki someday and wants to fully support her. Maki becomes embarrassed by this and leaves.
  </p>
  <p key="648ea8aa-73ef-4522-b258-05c41b094add">
   When Geto puts up a screen, Yuta notices it being put up. Later, Yuta comes across Geto and his defeated friends. Yuta gets angry and summons Rika to his side. As Geto launches multiple spirits to attack Yuta, Yuta defends against them all and manages to rescue his friends and heal them. As Geto summons more spirits, Yuta uses Rika's powers to easily exorcise all the spirits through the use of

  </p>
  <p key="8fde310b-a5c4-4147-8e84-3783de423916">
   Yuta decides to continue to fight and get close again, but Geto manages to break Yuta's katana. Yuta simply starts to punch Geto, which forces Geto to distance himself. After a brief chat the two have with each other, Geto decides to use all of his spirits against Yuta and Rika through the
   Extreme Quantity Cursed Spirit Manipulation "Tornado"
   technique. Yuta resolves to fully release Rika's power at the cost of his life with use of a

  </p>
  <p key="6ef34e5a-9216-42db-880e-007b2f3fdb19">
   Afterward, Yuta awakes to find all of his friends around him. Yuta notices Rika and explains what he had done to his friends' rejection, but is shocked when he notes Rika's curse has been undone. Gojo arrives and congratulates Yuta on undoing Rika's curse. Gojo also explains that Yuta is a distant relative of his through the sorcerer,

   , which accounts for the unprecedented strength of the curse he was able to place on Rika at her death. Yuta then bids Rika goodbye as she fades away.
  </p>
  <p key="dea00230-847e-47c4-8748-78143c160426">
   Later, Yuta is walking with Gojo, who assuages his concerns about being the cause of Geto's attack and hands Yuta back his student ID. Yuta then meets up with Maki, Panda, and Toge.

Tengen explains that before Kenjaku found the Prison Realm, it was outside of their barrier who believes it was overseas and reveals that by sealing the rear gate, they were hiding the existence of the "front" but it was useless. Yuji asks if it's like a back gate which Tengen confirms it is. Tengen tells them that Gojo is sealed inside of the rear gate as well and that the authority of opening the gate rests with Kenjaku as he is the bearer point of the "front". They add on that to break it open, they will need the

Yuki asks if the reason Hokkaido isn't included because of jujutsu society's barriers who confirms and adds on that Hokkaido has been established as vast sacred land. Yuji comments on how that's rugged lands. Tengen tells them that although conveyance to the other side may sound like an exaggeration, they a curse fell on everyone in Japan as preparation for the merger. Megumi asks

   Yuji wonders about the civilians already inside of the barrier which Tengen tells him that they will have one chance to exit much to Yuji's surprise and Yuta commenting on how generous that is of them. Tengen tells them that there isn't a rule about entering nor exiting the barrier and adds on that they believe that it's to stimulate the game. They also add on that in order to confine the players, the premise of them entering of their own free will is important. Megumi asks about the "game master" as Tengen tells them that each player will be given a
