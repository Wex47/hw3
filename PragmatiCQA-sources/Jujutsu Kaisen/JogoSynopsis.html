   During the meeting, Jogo reveals that they plan to destroy all the humans. Jogo also asks Suguru on how to defeat the sorcerers, which Suguru tells him that they first need to seal Gojo and then they need

   on their side.
   As Jogo suggest that they just go kill Gojo, Suguru tells him that they're not capable of doing that and that they will need a specific seal to trap Gojo. As Jogo gets excited and increases the temperature, Suguru tells him to calm down which Jogo responds by killing everyone in the restaurant. Jogo then asks Suguru how many of Sukuna's finger does his strength equal to, which Suguru tells him. Jogo gets excited and says that he will just go and kill Gojo.

  <p key="3bfeed6d-2a82-4ab4-88db-824d538efb27">
   Later, Jogo goes to attack Gojo when he is alone.
   Jogo throws multiple attacks at Gojo, but is shocked when Gojo is revealed to be unharmed.
   Gojo explains how his ability works and sticks out his arm to show him. Jogo is hesitant at first but decides to test it out, and finds out that he can't touch Gojo even though he is still reaching out to Gojo's hand. As Jogo refuses to accept this, Gojo takes this chance to land multiple blows on Jogo. Jogo is then sent flying when Gojo simply kicks him. Jogo notices that Gojo is keeping up with him and decides to attack, which Gojo dodges and lands a hit on Jogo.

  <p key="b2c4f24d-9bc7-4528-8194-4dea6f2135a2">
   Jogo remembers how Suguru had told him that he would die, as he decides to drag Gojo into his domain. Jogo wonders where Gojo is, when he suddenly shows up with Yuji.
   Jogo thinks about how he can't kill Yuji and asks why Yuji is here. Gojo says that Yuji is here to observe, to which Jogo replies with saying that that is foolish. Gojo responds that it will be okay since Jogo is weak, which makes Jogo angry. Jogo activates his domain expansions and traps Gojo and Yuji in it. Jogo is then shocked when Gojo and Yuji are fine and that nothing is working against Gojo. Jogo gets angry at Gojo, but he is suddenly trapped by Gojo's domain expansion. Jogo notices that he is now capable of seeing and feeling everything, Gojo then grabs him and explains how his technique works. Gojo says that he will spare Jogo since he has questions, and undoes his technique while also beheading him.
   Gojo then starts to asks questions, but Jogo is saved by Hanami.

   Sometime later, Jogo is relaxing at a hot spring when Mahito and Suguru show up. Jogo and Mahito decide to go with Suguru's plan of getting Sukuna on their side. They also talk about how they will go retrieve the fingers that are at the college.
   Later, Jogo talks with Suguru, Mahito, and Hanami about the plan on how they will obtain Sukuna's fingers along with three other cursed objects from the college.

   Before October 31, Jogo meets with Geto and talks about how Gojo is the strongest when he fights alone. They plan out how they will counter Gojo's techniques by surrounding him with innocent people. Jogo is then informed that the spirits will have to distract Gojo for 20 minutes before Geto can use the prison realm to seal Gojo. Later Jogo is playing mahjong with Hanami, Mahito, and Geto, as Geto explains how the Prison Gate's boundary works.
  </p>
  <p key="9c081ec2-7348-4750-88e9-2974699c29ec">
   On October 31, Jogo is with Hanami and Choso in the curtain at Shibuya. As Gojo arrives at their location, Jogo prepares to fight him along with the others. The spirits then block Gojo's exits and surround him with civilians. As Choso goes to attacks Gojo, Hanami and Jogo uses this chance to attack Gojo with Domain Amplification but Gojo manages to escape. Jogo comments about how Gojo was not going to run away, to which Gojo replies that he is surprised that the spirits thought that they could defeat him. As Gojo comes closer, Hanami and Jogo attack Gojo but Gojo easily dodge their attacks and even manages to rip Jogo's arm off. Jogo decides to distance himself from Gojo while also regenerating his arm but Gojo follows him. As Hanami tries to attack with his cursed technique, Jogo tells him to not deactivate his amplification. After Gojo manages to weaken Hanami by breaking the branches on Hanami's head, Jogo thinks about how strong Gojo is without using his cursed technique. As Choso manages to distract Gojo, Jogo and Hanami go to attack Gojo. As the attack doesn't work, Gojo attacks Hanami by using his cursed technique. Jogo tells Gojo that he will kill some humans if he does anything to Hanami, but Gojo still kills Hanami. After killing Hanami, Gojo tells Jogo that he is next.
  </p>
  <p key="8e5d6292-2061-40ba-bbf5-dcb429b8e89c">
   Jogo quickly hides behind the people and attack Gojo after he throws a person at Gojo. After Jogo retreats behind the people, he thinks about how he can't let Hanami's death be in vain and that he will continue with his current tactic. Jogo tells Choso to help out, which Choso does by attacking. Jogo then thinks about how the time is not right even though 20 minutes have already passed. When a train arrive, Jogo is glad that he has arrived. After the mutated humans pour out of the train, Jogo is greeted by Mahito. Jogo and Mahito start to talk, and Jogo tells Mahito that Hanami has been killed. As more humans are through to their location, Mahito and Choso distract Gojo and Jogo attacks him. The attack doesn't work, and Jogo cuts off his arm when Gojo grabs a hold of him. As Jogo hides in the crowd of humans, Jogo thinks about how Gojo won't activate his domain expansion and how Gojo will agonize that he will have to kill some humans just to take them down. Jogo is then shocked when Gojo activates his domain expansion for less than a second. Jogo along with Choso and Mahito are stunned after experiencing Gojo's domain expansion.
  </p>
  <p key="5ca83a75-069b-4434-95ca-075fd585bf1d">
   After Jogo gets over from being stunned, Jogo heads over to where Mahito and Geto is at. Jogo notices that something is wrong and asks about it, but watches when the Prison Gate's boundary forces its way to the ground. Jogo listens as Geto explains how the Prison Gate's boundary can't be move while it is processing Gojo. When Yuji shouts about what had happened to Gojo, Geto informs the others that sorcerers will be coming to their location and wants to know what they plan to do. When Choso says that he wants to kill Yuji, Jogo tells him that they need Yuji to become Sukuna but Choso doesn't care. As Jogo gets angry about this, Mahito calms him down and explains how they don't need Sukuna anymore since they have sealed Gojo. As Jogo tries to persuade the others that they still need Sukuna, Mahito proposes a game were the one that finds Yuji can decide what to do with him. As the other agree to this, Jogo tells the others that they should stay at the station since more sorcerers are coming towards them. The others don't listen and head out of the station, and Jogo follows after them. After all the humans have been cleared, Jogo chases after Mahito but a second Mahito blocks his way.

  <p key="78c1d720-3542-4eba-b93e-b728af9b0c33">
   When Dagon is exorcised, Jogo arrives at his location and bids him farewell along with how they will meet again as their souls will continue to circulate. Jogo then takes care of Nanami, Maki, and Naobito but stops when he suddenly senses one of Sukuna's fingers. Jogo reaches the location of where Sukuna's finger is at, and finds that Mimiko and Nanako are feeding Yuji Sukuna's fingers. As the two refuse to tell Jogo anything, Jogo tries to attack them but failed. Jogo then remember how
   <a href="Kenjaku.html" key="23a5031f-7f79-4a47-9b40-a083b6ffa807" title="Kenjaku">
    Pseudo-Geto
   </a>
   had said that Sukuna would temporary take over Yuji's body, if Yuji would consume ten of Sukuna's fingers within a single day.
   Jogo then feeds Yuji ten of Sukuna's fingers. He turns to see that Mimiko and Nanako have somehow revived themselves but before he can attack an awakened Sukuna tells him to release his grip. Jogo and the girls bow in fear before Sukuna when overwhelmed by his evil aura. He stays quiet while Sukuna talks to and ultimately kills Mimiko and Nanako before the King of Curses gives him permission to talk. He asks Sukuna to make a Binding Vow with Yuji that will allow the spirit to control their body permanently. Sukuna rejects the suggestion in favor of his own plan but offers to work with the curses if Jogo is able to hit him once during a fight.
  </p>
  <p key="aea5ac0f-0e48-44f6-b256-1140a2e964e3">
   Jogo then fights with Sukuna, but is completely overwhelmed by Sukuna.
   Jogo thinks about how much there is a difference in their power. When Sukuna says that he will keep Jogo company until he is bored, Jogo attacks but Sukuna dodges. Jogo then uses his Maximum: Meteor on Sukuna, but finds out that Sukuna is unharmed. Sukuna asks why Jogo is not using his domain, to which Jogo replies that his domain would lose to Sukuna's. When Sukuna starts to using fire, Jogo wonders what is going on since Sukuna's technique is supposed to be slashing and slicing. Sukuna starts preparing an attack, and Jogo follows suit.
  </p>
  <p key="75d00e01-72a2-4c3c-8219-c5777088471e">
   Jogo is then defeated by Sukuna and killed. He later meets with Hanami and Dagon, and talks about how they still have Mahito and how they will be reborn one day but a little different. As Jogo proclaims that they are the true humans, Sukuna shows up and explains how Jogo was weak for trying to be similar to humans. As Jogo says that Sukuna is right, Sukuna also says that he had fun fighting Jogo and that he should be proud. Jogo starts crying and wonders what is going on, to which Sukuna replies that he doesn't know.
