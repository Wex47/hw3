   is driving. They're supposed to be on their way to meet the Kyoto Principal, but Gojo says they still have time before the meeting and asks for if Ijichi wants to make a pit stop. Ijichi refuses and says they should be early for once.
  </p>
  <p key="94d9201c-2545-4bb5-bc79-eb3e5011a37c">
   Satoru asks him to stop the car and gets out. He tells Ijichi to go ahead, confusing him and leading him to ask if he's being tested. After Ijichi drives off, leaving Gojo in the midst of darkness alone on a road, almost as if he's expecting something.
  </p>
  <p key="161d0dfc-5fc0-4793-a299-5f4ee8688b16">
   Suddenly, Jogo's shadow jumps into the light of the moon above Gojo and attempts to crush the sorcerer. Gojo is able to avoid the attack and Jogo leaves a giant crater in the road from the impact.

   Satoru asks who his new assailant is, but Jogo creates a volcano head from the wall next to the sorcerer. It blasts Gojo with intense flames, leading to the cursed spirit believing he's won. He claims his opponent was nothing special but Gojo suddenly reappears from the inferno using an invisible shield.
  </p>
  <p key="5eefd872-106a-426b-93a7-d13625ce8d00">
   Annoyed, Jogo calls his opponent stupid and adjusts the plugs in his ears. Gojo notices that his opponent is an unregistered special grade that he can communicate with normally. He's surprised that this curse is even more powerful than the current Sukuna. Jogo asks if the sorcerer is losing heart, but Gojo claims things are just getting fun.
  </p>
  <p key="5ce20b59-c148-4e60-8bf5-983a82dfcb22">
   Jogo says his opponent has no sense of danger and spawns a number of

   from the top opening in his head. They all try to stab him at once with their stingers, but Gojo is able to stop them all in place with a single hand sign. Gojo sarcastically asks what happens if they sting him but they all suddenly detonate. He's able to avoid the explosion and notices that they all detonated as a resulted of a signal using sound.
  </p>
  <p key="6e7c2806-c662-4378-8368-4bebeb59500c">
   Satoru regains his footing on top of the wall next to the road and Jogo quickly rushes him with a palm-full of flames. He appears to strike Gojo's head with fire and follows up with a powerful blast of flame that appears to incinerate his opponent. Believing he's won, Jogo claims Geto was exaggerating and that this sorcerer was as weak as all humans. He adds that humans are too weak to deserve to live, but is interrupted by Gojo's voice.
  </p>
  <p key="b82f9b26-d797-4a73-b11c-70c791e3227b">
   The sorcerer wipes away the smoke as if nothing happened, shocking his opponent. Jogo demands an explanation and Satoru simply says his attacks never reach him. The curse claims he felt his attacks land but Gojo explains that what he touched was the "Infinity" between them.
  </p>
  <p key="2ecd3bb8-af03-4302-9014-b323bfa66bf3">
   To demonstrate, Gojo allows his opponent to try and touch his hand. When Jogo attempts to touch it, his hand slows down to point of stopping just before their hands meet. Satoru taunts his opponent and grabs his hand before striking his lower abdomen with a powerful palm strike.
  </p>
  <p key="a4587b86-fecd-498f-bb57-3a353dd847f5">
   Jogo reels from the attack and admits he's shocked by it's power. He surmises it's beyond a simple strike reinforced with cursed energy but can't figure out exactly what he was hit with. Gojo states that his cursed technique allows him to bring Infinity into reality by harnessing the power of divergence and convergence. With little effort, Gojo creates a small ball of empty space and unleashes it's power using

  <p key="4865d150-1ccb-44dc-adbe-bfee4ebe9cc5">
   The impact of the blast sends Jogo crashing through the nearby forest. As he stumbles out of the other side of the woods, Satoru uses his incredible speed to meet him there. Jogo tries to take him by surprise with a fire blast, but Gojo disappears as if he was never there and suddenly reappears behind his opponent. With a ferociously strong kick, Gojo sends the curse crashing into a large body of water.
  </p>
  <p key="a62e9853-d3fd-480d-9cc9-a4da7f943a14">
   Knowing what his opponent will explore next, Gojo disappears to get Yuji. While Jogo slowly recovers, he realizes Geto was actually right when he said trying to kill Satoru would result in his death. He decides the only way to fight back is to use Domain Expansion but notices the sorcerer disappeared again.
  </p>
  <p key="6174f1c5-a49f-4071-8057-a08077d037fd">
   Gojo reappears with his student, who Jogo recognizes to be Sukuna's vessel. He states Yuji will be sitting in on today's class.
   This irritates Jogo, who asks if he plans to use the boy as a shield. Gojo restates that it's just a lesson for his student, and Jogo claims he'll be a liability. The cocky sorcerer replies that they should be fine since Jogo is so weak.
  </p>
  <p key="be998390-b992-4e46-b634-1b94fa9a2192">
   This enrages Jogo, who's head nearly explodes with flames. Yuji worries that he's in danger but Gojo encourages him that everything will be fine. Beyond angry, Jogo brings the humans inside his Domain Expansion: Coffin of the Iron Mountain. Gojo sensei uses the opportunity to explain the strengths and weaknesses of a Domain Expansion technique. Jogo attempts to blast both of them but Gojo cancels the attack out using his own cursed energy.
  </p>
  <p key="c7301d1c-0633-4369-af7c-aae04fe03ec5">
   Gojo reveals that cursed techniques employed within a Domain will always hit their target. Jogo is surprised he blocked yet another attack and mulls over how a normal sorcerer would've burned up just entering his Domain. Originally, Jogo would've been fine if he was unable to kill the sorcerer. However, he showed the difference in their power and now Jogo's pride is getting to him.
  </p>
  <p key="27c557c4-db48-42c6-8d70-782f6b672752">
   With the final lesson about Domain Expansions, Gojo sensei tells Yuji the most effective countermeasure is to expand your own Domain so long as it's more polished. Jogo attempts to use his cursed technique, but Gojo takes off his blindfold, revealing his eyes and unleashes his own Domain Expansion:

  <p key="890fafd1-9e34-4260-a667-c2f6ddeb60c9">
   This brings Jogo into a spatial-type Domain within an infinite void called the Limitless. In this place, Jogo is forced to process all the information presented to him by the universe at once, paralyzing his mind and body infinitely. Before Jogo perishes, Satoru closes his domain and takes off his opponent's head, intending to interrogate him. He drop his defeated opponent's head onto the ground and steps on it, demanding to know who sent him.

   Before Gojo can manage to exorcise Jogo or get any information out of him, Hanami sends a floral spear at the source to save his comrade. The spear sticks into the ground, creating space between the sorcerer and Jogo. It also spawns a garden of flowers that puts Satoru and Yuji into a harmless trance.
  </p>
  <p key="29c59bc7-ee9b-41b8-85b8-d44c88a857f2">
   While they're distracted, Hanami grabs Jogo's head and creates a wooden curse to attack Yuji. He manages to escape the area, impressing Gojo, who surmises that powerful cursed spirits are working together. Gojo sensei decides to speed up Yuji's training over the next month and expresses that he wants all his students to be able to defeat high-level cursed sprits.
  </p>
  <p key="deddda35-8294-4717-906e-a13b5c6ec0e5">
   Following Yuji's training, Gojo expects him to go on tough missions for fieldwork. By the time the Kyoto Goodwill Event comes around, Gojo sensei expects Yuji to be able to show off the fruits of his labor.
