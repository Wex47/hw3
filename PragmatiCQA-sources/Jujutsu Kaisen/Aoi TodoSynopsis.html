Aoi thought he won and started to walk away, but was stopped when Yuji got back up. Aoi got excited by this and asked what Yuji's name is along with what is Yuji's type of woman. Yuji introduced himself and gave an answer that Aoi agreed with, Aoi visualized a memory about a school life that they didn't have and called Yuji his best friend. When Yuji is surrounded by the Kyoto students, Aoi saves him and forces the students to leave.

   Aoi and Yuji then continue their fight, during which Aoi figures out how Yuji is able to adapt to his surroundings. Aoi also figured out that Yuji's cursed energy has a habit of lagging and says that is wrong. Aoi told Yuji that if he wants to get stronger then he will have to stop having his cursed energy lag, which Yuji agreed with. As both of the two continued to fight, Aoi noticed that Yuji is still growing as the fight continues. Aoi then explained how cursed energy flows in the body, which Yuji managed to understand. Both of them continue to fight, and Aoi decides to help Yuji grow stronger.

   Aoi rebuffs Yuji's speech, telling him to accept that the path of jujutsu sorcerers cannot be stopped by feelings of guilt or sadness and to keep moving forward to honor the memories of those passed. Continuing to spar with Mahito, Aoi uses Boogie Woogie to evade Mahito's attempts to use

   , as well as avoiding Mahito's transfigured humans. As Mahito goes in for another attack, Todo uses Boogie Woogie to swap himself and Yuji, allowing Yuji to strike Mahito with a Black Flash. With Yuji now ready to fight once more, Aoi welcomes him back into the battle and promptly rips his shirt off. The two continue to trade blows with Mahito as Aoi switches places and manages to land a

   and leaves the transfigured human for Aoi to fight against, Aoi assumes that the transfigured human is around a grade 2 or 3 but is surprised by it's strength when he's sent flying into a building. Todo is able to get back up and manages to easily finish it off with a single blow. He notices that there are two more transfigured humans and asks for them to forgive him.

   Aoi is able to defeat the other transfigured humans and regroups with Yuji as he comments on how Mahito didn't want him to be in the fun. Aoi realizes that Mahito has activated his

   Aoi is able to minimize the damage from his Black Flash attack. Mahito tries to end Aoi with

   but Todo is able to activate Boogie Woogie by slapping his remaining hand on Mahito's free hand and is able to allow Yuji to land an attack on Mahito. Aoi is lying on the ground and thinks to himself about how it's a miracle that he just got away with just a few injuries on his hand.

   While Yuji and Mahito are battling each other, Aoi suddenly appears and asks Mahito if he knew that an arm is just a decoration. He claps his hand together which leaves Mahito under the impression that he's going to activate
