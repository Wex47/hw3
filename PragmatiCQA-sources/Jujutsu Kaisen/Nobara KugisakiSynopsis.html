   Saori
   , a girl from Tokyo moved to her village. Nobara idolized Saori, but the villagers ostracized her. Saori became good friends with Nobara, making treats for her that Nobara has never tried before. The villager's hate drove Saori's family out, which disgusted Nobara and was the primary reason for her leaving to Tokyo, hoping to see her friend.

Gojo tells Nobara and Yuji that they will handle this mission alone since it will be a test to see what they're capable of. Nobara and Yuji then head into the building. Nobara suggests that they split up, which Yuji disagrees with but Nobara doesn't care and heads upward in the building while Yuji takes care of the lower floors.

  <p key="e0fac397-40c7-4c59-8df5-b498cafbf5f0">
   While searching the upper floors, Nobara finds a cursed spirit that has disguised itself as a mannequin and uses her cursed technique to exorcise it.
   Suddenly, Nobara hears a noise and notices a child in the corner. Nobara tries to have the child come with her but he wouldn't move. Nobara plans on getting Yuji to help her, but a cursed spirit suddenly appears and takes the child hostage.

   After exorcising the spirit, Nobara and Yuji get into an argument about how that was dangerous and that Yuji had broken through a concrete wall. Yuji then asks why Nobara came to the magic college, which Nobara replied that she didn't like living in the country and that this was the only way to not have to worry about money. Nobara then thanks Yuji for helping her out. After the mission is accomplished and the child is taken home, Gojo says that they will go eat now to which Nobara suggests sushi.

When a parent of one of the students in the detention center arrive and asks about their child, Yuji says that they will go rescue them which Nobara agrees with. The three head into the screen containing the detention center, and notice that the magical force has expanded the dormitory.

   Nobara then comes across what seems to be multiple cursed spirits and prepares to take them on.
   Nobara takes on the spirit but can't exorcise it as she didn't bring enough nails, and is about to be eaten. Suddenly, Megumi comes to Nobara's aid, and places her inside one of his frog shikigami, to which she reacts with disgust.
   Megumi takes Nobara out of the territory and gives her to Kiyotaka, who takes her to the hospital.

When Maki, Panda, and Toge shows up, Nobara asks who they are which Megumi tells her that they are the second-year students. Panda then tells the two that they will be participating in the Kyoto Goodwill Event, which Nobara wonders what that is.
