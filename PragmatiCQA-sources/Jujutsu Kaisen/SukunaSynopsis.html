   Days later, Sukuna taunts Yuji about how his awakening is killing people because he had eaten one of his fingers which Yuji simply tells Sukuna to not to tell Megumi.

   Sukuna was seen watching Yuji's fight against

   Sukuna manages to take control of Yuji's body, after Nanako, Mimiko, and

   feed Yuji some of Sukuna's fingers. Sukuna has the three kneel before him, but cuts off the top of Jogo's head when he only takes a knee. Sukuna asks Nanako and Mimiko what they want with him, after which he proceeds to kill them as he doesn't like them ordering him around. Sukuna then asks Jogo, but Jogo says that he wants nothing and explains how he just want Sukuna to fully revive. Jogo explains how Yuji can't take control right now and advises that Sukuna make a bind vow to permanently take control, but Sukuna reject it since he has other plans. Sukuna then makes a deal with Jogo: if he can land a hit on him then he’ll do anything they want (for now), which Jogo agrees to.

  <p key="9b68cac5-4f83-4f91-8404-b33c6c91e452">
   Sukuna then fight Jogo and completely overwhelms him. Sukuna taunts Jogo, while easily dodging all of his attacks. As Jogo uses his Maximum: Meteor attack, Sukuna forces the humans to stay put until he gives the signal. As the attack lands, Sukuna easily comes out unscathed. Sukuna wonders why Jogo is not using his domain, which Jogo says that his domain would lose. As things get interesting, Sukuna starts to use fire based attacks much to Jogo's confusion. Sukuna prepares to continue his fight with Jogo and subsequently defeats him.

   As Jogo is dying, Sukuna meets with him and explains how Jogo is weak for trying to be like the humans. As Jogo agrees with him, Sukuna also explains how he had fun fighting Jogo and that he should be proud. Jogo starts to cry and wonders what it is, which Sukuna says that he doesn't know. Suddenly

   . Suddenly Sukuna senses that Megumi has summoned a powerful shikigami, and tells Uraume that he has something to do. Sukuna tells Uraume that it won't be long until he is completely free, and that Uraume shouldn't neglect their preparations. Sukune then bids Uraume farewell and leave.

  <p key="af02ea5e-b4d4-4dc3-af31-21cc3019ccf1">
   Sukuna quickly arrives at the shikigami's location and save the sorcerer that was facing off against Megumi. Sukuna notices the situation and thinks about how it was a good idea to save the sorcerer since his death would result in Megumi's death as well. Sukuna heals Megumi and tells him to not die yet since there is something that he need Megumi to do still. Sukuna thinks about how he'll defeat the shikigami, then that would void the ritual since he is an outsider. Sukuna then prepares to face the shikigami.

   Mahoraga attacks with its sword, which Sukuna manages to block. Sukuna then wounds Mahoraga with his technique and figures that Mahoraga's sword is capable of exorcising any spirit since it uses positive energy. Mahoraga heals itself, which Sukuna attacks again but Mahoraga manages to counter it. Sukuna figures that Mahoraga is capable of seeing his technique. Mahoraga attacks which Sukuna tries to block but is sent flying. Mahoraga attacks again but Sukuna dodges and wounds Mahoraga.

   Mahoraga heals itself again, which Sukuna figures that Mahoraga's ability is to adapt to any and all phenomena. Sukuna thinks about how this is what Megumi was trying to summon in their last fight, and that Mahoraga would have killed him. Sukuna then activates his domain:

   , and uses its effect to cut up everything within a certain distance. While this is happening, Sukuna thinks about how to use his ability to defeat Mahoraga. When Mahoraga starts to heal, Sukuna uses a different ability to defeat Mahoraga.

   Sukuna starts to leave, and tells Megumi's attacker to leave, in which the attacker runs into Sukuna's domain and dies. Sukuna then takes Megumi to get medical treatment and leaves while thinking about how it’s not much longer. Sukuna then arrives back at the location where he had fought Mahoraga, and tells Yuji to take a look as Yuji takes back control.
