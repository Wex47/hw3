   as a solution. Jogo gets excited by the Prison Realm tool only for Kenjaku to tell him to calm down. Jogo instead kills everyone in the restaurant as a response and asked how much his strength is compared to a number of Sukuna's fingers. Kenjaku guessed Jogo's strength is equal to 8 or 9 fingers, which Jogo claimed to be enough to kill Gojo in exchange of the Prison Realm.

   That night Kenjaku and Hanami watch as Jogo loses to Gojo and is pushed into a corner. Kenjaku stays out of sight as he needs to keep any hint of ‘Geto’s survival’ hidden until later. Kenjaku later enters Dagon’s domain to meet with Mahito and the other curses. When Jogo and Hanami arrive, Kenjaku says this defeat proves they should avoid Gojo until the operation to seal him on October 31st in Shibuya. An operation that he will explain later, which

The duo would later place one of Sukuna's fingers inside Junpei's apartment, causing a cursed spirit to kill Junpei's mother. Exploiting Junpei’s friendship with Mahito and grief to convince him this attack was arranged by a classmate. After unlocking Junpei’s cursed energy, Mahito and Kenjaku watched as he attacks his classmates. Mahito placed the barrier over the school to prevent weak humans from existing or entering, as Kenjaku is hiding his residuals. The plan being that if Junpei and Yuji fight it will force Yuji to make a binding vow with Sukuna, which would help them convince Sukuna to work with them. Kenjaku left after the conversation. The plan would ultimately fail due to Sukuna’s own interests and Mahito would flee the scene.

The finger left in Junpei’s course would be taken by Jujutsu High, was vital to this plan as they planned a seal on it so they could track it’s location to the hidden store room. Hanami’s attack on the Goodwill Event was part of this mission as a distraction away from the school and Mahito’s break-in robbery. Kenjaku recommends that they avoid killing any students as Sukuna appears to have some interest in them and they can only unleash him at the critical moment, October 31st. Mahito would end up stealing six fingers and Death Painting Wombs 1-3.
