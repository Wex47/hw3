   On October 31, Yuji is with Mei Mei and Ui Ui at Aoyama Cemetery while Gojo handles the situation in Shibuya. When Mei Mei receives a call about a curtain appearing at Meiji-Jingumae Station, the three head out to check on the situation. Once they arrive at Meiji-Jingumae Station, they are informed that there is a second curtain with the curtain at the station. When they are informed that there are transfigured humans between the two curtains, Yuji thinks about how that it is Mahito's doing. After being informed about the station, Yuji waits with Ui Ui while Mei Mei checks up on the situation on the station. Yuji starts to get impatient but Ui Ui calms him down. Once Mei Mei is finished investigating, she informs them about the situation that is happening in the station. Yuji asks if Mahito is in the station, Mei Mei tells him that she didn't see him but he might be in the station since there are mutated humans in the station. Mei Mei then tells Yuji that they will split up.

After hearing the spirits words, Yuji remembers what Gojo had told him about curtains and notices a cursed object behind the spirit. Yuji figures that the object is connected to the curtains and decides to break it. When the spirit starts to talk about how the humans taste after Mahito mutates them, Yuji starts to attack the spirit. Yuji tells the spirit to not underestimate humans, which the spirit says that Yuji isn't smart since he can't even guess what kind of curse he is. Yuji says that the spirit is a grasshopper curse, which the spirit thinks about how Yuji is smart. As the curse attack Yuji, Yuji easily manages to dodge the curse's attack. As the curse continues its attacks, Yuji analyzes the curse's capabilities and figures what the curse is capable of. Yuji figures that this is a fight of two arms vs. four arms and starts his counter attack on the curse. Yuji starts to pummel the curse which the curse decides to counter with his hidden trick. As the curse uses his abdomen to attack, Yuji grabs it and breaks it off. Yuji then kills the curse and breaks the object that it was protecting.

As Yuji goes to try and destroy the device on his ear, Kokichi says that he is their ally and that Gojo has been sealed. Yuji listens along with Mei Mei and Ui Ui, as Kokichi explains how he had already been killed days before and he has set up a back up plan just incase something had happened to him. Kokichi also says that he was able to rule out both Mei Mei and Yuji as spies. As Mei Mei says that Kokichi could just be wrong, which Kokichi says that they are currently being followed by cursed users. Mei Mei notices that they are two of them and asks Yuji if the users are then the curse he had faced, which Yuji replies that the two are stronger. As Mei Mei says that they should continue on, which Kokichi tells them that there is a screen that won't let them through. Kokichi then tells them that Mei Mei should open a path, so that Yuji can head back and head to where Gojo is above ground.

After Nanami agrees to Kokichi's plan, Nanami assigns Yuji, Megumi, and Takuma to dealing with the screens while he heads out to meet with Kiyotaka. After Nanami leaves, Takuma informs the two that there are two problems with Gojo being sealed. Yuji listens as Takuma explains how all the shamans that were saved by Gojo are going to be a nuisance with the authorities of the college, and that they would lost a war with all those that have hidden themselves in the shadow because of Gojo.

Yuji imbues the knife with his cursed energy and blocks Yuta's katana, however, he ends up being kicked by Yuta who states Yuji is too focus on his katana. Yuji tries to defend himself with the knife but it's slashed apart and Yuji is injured, he is able to kick Yuta away and also breaks the katana he's wielding as well. Yuji tries to close the distance between him and Yuta until the cursed spirit Rika shows up and restrains Yuji from moving. Yuji is confused by Rika's appearance, wondering if it's a shikigami.

Tengen adds that a Kogane is less game master than an interface. They say that they may think of the game master as the Culling Game programmer which confuses Yuji. Yuji says that they're unable to subtract rules that have already exist while Megumi says that there are ways to counteract the rules.

   Before leaving the room, Master Tengen informs Yuji and Megumi that Kinji is making money as a bookie for an underground fight club. They also add on that the spectators are mostly non-sorcerers and possibly curse users in the crowd.

  <p key="19327928-15f2-4626-ad95-430f03567bc3">
   In a forest, Yuji and Megumi are changing clothes where Yuji wonders why they're changing clothes. Megumi tells him that Kinji got into a fight with the authorities and was suspended from school and currently is engaged in illegal jujutsu activities. He adds on that if Kinji recognizes they're from Jujutsu High, he's likely to bolt. The two head towards the underground fight club as Yuji wonders if they're on Jujutsu High's side and if Kinji will cooperate. Megumi tells him that he's not sure and all the upper classmen's says he's a good-for-nothing whereas Yuta says he's stronger than himself. Megumi tells Yuji that they will need his strength as one of the two guards tell the pair to leave as the place isn't for kids.
  </p>
  <p key="96d59862-0015-4448-9590-97f99697542b">
   Megumi calmly tells the guard that they need money much to Yuji's confusion. The guard swings his arm to punch Megumi who remains motionless as the guard states that rule one is no one says anything about the club, asking Megumi where he got the information or he'll beat him up. Yuji watches Megumi lie to the guard that he didn't get the name of the individual he fought against before he killed him, saying that it was about a month ago that the one he fought against was a scumbag. Megumi says to let him take the place as Yuji realizes that Megumi is doing, keeping his mouth shut as the other guard announces that the boss is fine with it. The dark haired guard continues on and points to Yuji that he will be the one who will fight who's surprised by this.

  <p key="5de6bfa8-ee2e-4332-b3ac-772191286588">

   was actually watching through the security cameras then it's likely that he's present. Megumi tells Yuji that he will fight and get a look around while he sneak into the garage possibly. Megumi says that they want to see what he's doing and adds on that if they find him attempting to sneak in, there's no chance of getting them to trust him along with being unable to meet Kinji. Yuji says that if that were to happen, they can just use force as Megumi tells him that's a last resort.
   Megumi says he should lie low for tonight but also doesn't want waste anymore time before Tsumuki's deadline as Yuji goes on to check his phone, stating that it's 5 p.m. on the 10th which leaves them nine days.

   Later on, Yuji is inside of a room with the same guard as before who informs him of the two rules. The first rule is not to run away and the second is no usage of cursed techniques. Yuji is confused as to why cursed techniques are off limits as the guard tells him that there are non-sorcerers in the crowd who won't be able to see them, before adding on that an invisible fight isn't fun to watch. Yuji then asks why running away isn't allowed where the guard says he will have to fight where the spectators can see him. He then continues on with his questions, asking how's the boss like as the guard asks him if he's curious where Yuji confirms. The guard tells him that there are two types of fights; unscripted such as today's tournament and scripted fights. The guard goes to open a door as they tell Yuji to look sharp and he will have a possibility to talk to the boss. Yuji is excited and puts on a smile.

  <p key="a85858fa-4f7d-410a-8bc8-45adc33fe87a">
   Now inside of the fight ring, Yuji asks if they had removed the upper floor for the spectators and left the lower floor for the fight to happen which the guard confirms. Yuji is shocked by who his

A sudden voice calls out and welcomes everyone to the Gachinko fight club tournament, stating their name to be the announcer, John Bobby. The announcer continues on and announces the fighters. The Dangerous fireball kid, Yuji Itadori and his opponent, Panda! The fight starts where Yuji and Panda trades blows as the announcer comments on the fight.
   While in battle, Yuji asks Panda if he's met Kinji who declines, telling him that because Kinji is aware of who he is and isn't suspicious of him but he's avoiding him. Panda tells him that the other third-year

   Panda asks if Yuji is hiding that he's a jujutsu student which he confirms, saying that Yuji will know what to do next. Yuji suddenly punches Panda which sends him flying as Panda complains about being unable to move and how the Animal Welfare Society won't allow this. Yuji thinks to himself about how bad of an actor Panda is as the announcer says that the winner is Yuji.
  </p>
  <p key="fa80702b-6838-4f3b-ae0a-cbd5e3bf98da">
   Kirara leads Yuji into a room as they wonder if Yuji is a first year in high school, calling Yuji "Yu" which confuses him. They continue on that Kinji had to repeat a year in junior high, saying that Yuji seems cheerful and that they love it.
   Inside of the room with Kinji, he asks Yuji "if I told there was a job where you could get 1 million yen a month just for doing a certain thing for 1 hour a day, would you believe me?" leaving Yuji confused.
  </p>
  <p key="d89d4a7b-9677-4a72-82c6-7db253307b0a">
   Yuji tells Kinji that it depends on what the "work" is. Kinji's response to this is telling Yuji that in order for him to be able to know what the "work" is, he must purchase the information for 2 hundred yen. Shocked by this, Yuji comments on how it sounds dishonest which is confirmed by Kinji who says that this is a typical scamming method. He continues on talking about how the scammer pretends to be wealthy and then sell information on how to get rich, thus becoming rich. Kinji says that it's easy enough to see the lie, but only if they aren't that idiotic to be fooled by it, he says the reason why is because of 'passion'.
  </p>
  <p key="01f39ee7-df5e-400e-b518-18c799a98122">
   Kinji continues on telling Yuji that people get carried away by their 'passion' and ends up making rash decisions. He says that people without passion can't fall in love and that both the scammer and the scammed have passion which is: "I'm going to change my life." He then tells Yuji that he loves people's passion and asks Yuji if he knows what the more direct exchange of passion is who responds confused with gambling. Kinji confirms Yuji's answer, continuing on to tell him that life is a gamble and that a mountain of women that dumped him because they despised gambling, however, they got it wrong. He says that the ones who can't bet big and doesn't know when to call it quits are the ones cast aside from society, he adds on that there isn't a single person on earth who doesn't gamble, what they hate isn't gambling but instead loss and ruin.

  <p key="193b6899-ff6e-43b1-bcbd-61814feeca3e">
   Yuji wonders aren't there some people who just want peaceful lives but Kinji responds by saying he doesn't know anyone like that. He tells Yuji that passion is gambling, gambling is life and love is control. He says that with his fight club he eventually will want to control the country's passion, he says that now is the perfect time to expand his business as the existence of

   Yuji thinks back to Megumi telling him not to mention Jujutsu High until the very end and just as he's about to say something, a phone rings and interrupts him. Kinji ignores the phone and asks Yuji if he would fancy a drink, he says yes but asks for no alchohol which surprises Kinji who wonders if Yuji can't handle liquor.
  </p>
  <p key="c8bd33a4-f3b6-45c9-9534-a01bd1c9c9fb">
   Yuji tells Kinji that it isn't because of that but instead he's underaged, Kinji comments on how Yuji doesn't look like the type to care about that.

   Kinji finishes his drink which scares Yuji as he asks Yuji if he's from Jujutsu High. Yuji attempts to reason with him but Kinji doesn't listen as two doors surround Yuji who manages to dodge it.
   Yuji continues trying to reason with him but Kinji kicks him away as another set of doors close around his neck. Kinji says that a call from Kirara is a signal for an emergency before continuing to brutally attack Yuji wo manages to defend himself before grabbing Kinji's shirt collar and slamming his forehead against Kinji's.

   As the two continue fighting, Yuji is kicked out through a door by Kinji who readies himself to punch Yuji who tells Megumi and Panda to stay out of his fight.
   Kinji tells Yuji that he's underestimating him and punches Yuji who manages to stand up despite Kinji's punch, however, blood squirts out of Yuji's nose as Kinji tells Yuji that he's insane but he'll listen to what they have to say, that is if Yuji is able withstand his

  <p key="e6dabc1a-f2b5-495f-8312-fd489f3b88fb">
   Kinji yells at Yuji telling him that when a sorcerer asks another sorcerer for help, they're basically asking "please risk your life with me". He continues to tell Yuji that he will need to convey a "fever" worthy of making him risk his life- saying that instead of doing that Yuji came to him because he was told to. He asks what Yaga is doing, saying that Yaga was supposed to find weaklings like Yuji. Responding calmly, Yuji tells Kinji that he doesn't have a fever and that he's a cog.
   Annoyed, Kinji asks Yuji if he's being serious, telling him that's boring before going to punch him which sends him crashing into a railing. He asks Yuji if it hurts and according to Gojo, his cursed energy is rougher than others. Not getting an answer from Yuji who remains limp, Kinji wonders if Yuji is dead before calling out to Panda and Megumi, to retrieve Yuji and get lost.
   Before he could finish his sentence, Kinji is surprised by Yuji standing behind him who says that he's a cog and that cogs have a role. With his role to exorcise curses, he says that if Kinji's help is needed to do that, Yuji will follow him everywhere until Kinji says yes.

   Yuji goes up close to Kinji and asks him what's his role who's surprised by the determination in Yuji's eyes. Kinji goes on to say that he'll hit Yuji, however, before he could finish his sentence, Kirara interrupts by asking Kinji if he's getting heated. Kinji tells Megumi to come down to make a deal before smacking Yuji.

   The four of them sits down to talk where Kinji is understandably shocked by Gojo being sealed with Panda, Megumi and Yuji confirming this. Panda speaks up by telling them that Yaga has died, he apologizes for keeping quiet about it but confirms it's true. He reassures Yuji that he didn't die at Shibuya but he got into a scuffle with the higher-ups after the incident.
   Yuji says that even knowing that doesn't make it alright, he tries to continue on but Panda cuts him off, telling him that its alright and thanks him for his concern. After a short discussion, Kinji agrees to help them with the Culling Game, satisfying Megumi and Yuji. However, he tells them that he hasn't let his feelings get the best of him and after the Culling Game is over, Megumi, Panda and Yuji will have to cooperate with him. Panda comes to the conclusion that Kinji is trying to take advantage of the revisions to jujutsu law as the existence of cursed spirits have been made public, asking Kinji what exactly is he trying to do.
  </p>
  <p key="307f0a2d-03ed-42e3-8823-94daa5faa016">
   Megumi says that whatever Kinji plans on doing, he doubt it will be difficult, prompting Kinji to ask him what he knows who calmly replies that he's the Zenin family head much to Kinji and Kirara's surprise. Calling him sea urchin head once again only for Megumi to correct him that it's "Fushiguro", Kinji asks for them to get along, confusing Megumi. Panda tells the group that they'll have to decide on who's going to which colony, adding on that he believes Yuta was heading to Miyagi.
   Moments later, a Kogane appears over Yuji's head, announcing that a player has added a rule to the Culling Game, rule nine: "players can now view the information of other players such as "name", "points", "number of times they've added rules" and "residing colony".
  </p>
  <p key="c989a235-a6dd-47f2-9a8d-c3fd6c8034c4">
   Megumi asks the Kogane why it sounds different all of a sudden who responds by telling the group it's speaking as the liaison assigned to Yuji which generates a response from Panda who says Master Tengen did say something regarding it. Megumi comments on how it already counted Yuji as a player in the Culling Game and aside from the people who received cursed techniques and cursed objects from Kenjaku, people only become a player upon entering a colony.
   Yuji says it's Sukuna and it's a possibility that one of the sorcerers entered a contract with Kenjaku and became a cursed object. Megumi still says it's strange, pointing out that Yuji ingested Sukuna's finger of his own will and that he witnessed it, telling Yuji that they'll discuss it later.
   Megumi tells Yuji to ask his Kogane to show the player info who does so and points out one of the players: Kashimo Hajime. He continues on by saying Kashimo previously had 200 points and wonders why they added an additional rule which Yuji that they must've killed at least 40 people in the last few days and he doubts the reasons are nice. Megumi tells him that they can continue on with the Culling Game without killing anyone and asks for the Kogane to show him players with 100 points or more.
  </p>
  <p key="0c3c5e19-b7e0-48b6-8660-2bac6f45e6cd">
   The Kogane tells Megumi that it's assigned to Yuji but Yuji reassures the Kogane and tells them to do what Megumi asked them to do. With the Kogane searching, Megumi tells them that unless people caught in the game like Tsumiki rush to get out of the barriers, every past sorcerers in a new body must have had an incentive for entering a contract with Kenjaku. He continues on and says that he doubts they have much motivation to participate in the Culling Game, and if there are other players with plenty of points such as Kashimo but before he could finish, Yuji interrupts and says he understands what he's getting at.
   Yuji says they will need to find someone with a 100 points or more who isn't interested in adding rules which Megumi continues his line of thought and says they will need to press that player to make a rule to allow Tsumiki out of the Culling Game. Just as they finish, the Kogane is finished with the search and shows the players with 100 points or more.
   Megumi notices that there's another player with 100 points and says the problem they've run into is rule 8, so they'll need to offset that. However, both Yuji and Panda aren't sure of what rule 8 is and asks what the rule is.
  </p>
  <p key="f1aa97e9-dc56-4c0e-b282-a8bd9961f8dc">
   Megumi says they could add a rule that allows players to transfer points among themselves which the Kogane confirms this. He continues on and says that if friends continue to keep passing around points, they won't lose their cursed techniques and die. Megumi says that if possible they could add another rule to spend points to get out of the game. Kinji comments on Megumi's proposed rule and asks if it conflicts with the rule regarding a "long-lasting effect" on the game. Megumi says he believes so as well but he says it could work on the condition that the player drags a substitute non-player into the game. Kiniji says that it would depend on what the Kogane says. Yuji says that they have a plan of action which Megumi says that as they look for the "Angel" to break the prison realm's seal, they'll target

   Using the Kogane to view the players, Yuji says that Angel isn't on the list. Panda says that 'Angel' is probably not her real name like Yuji and Sukuna. Megumi tells them that Master Tengen mentioned she's on the eastern side of Tokyo inside the number 2 colony. Kinji asks them if they're aware of how Angel looks like where Megumi tells him that they'll only know once they see her. Kinji asks him if he's sure about that but continues on without waiting for a response from Megumi, telling them that he and Panda will go to Tokyo colony number 2 while Megumi and Yuji will go to number 1 and Kirara will be on stand-by outside of the barrier. Panda asks why Kinji suggested it where Kinji responds by saying that judging from the points,

  <p key="7eea1841-8108-46b5-a95f-b2ec46eeffa8">
   Kinji continues talking to prove his point, Panda having a good nose and should be the one focusing on the search for Angel. He adds on that they haven't been contacted by Yuta, meaning that their phones can't be used inside the barrier so they should have someone outside observing the the situation outside. Kirara ends up agreeing with their plan with Yuji commenting on how he and Megumi should be on separate teams, concerned about Sukuna only for Megumi to yell at him to shut up.
   Informing Yuji that the roles of their 3 senpais can't be changed so Yuji should stop being self-centered much to his shock. Getting into a small argument, Yuji claims that he's being considerate of Megumi who fires back by asking him if he's going to say that every time and that he can't be bothered as it's a waste of time, noticing the two arguing, Panda tells them simply to stop fighting.

   Ready to enter the Culling Game, Yuji, Megumi, Panda and Kinji all readies themselves to enter the Culling Game and confirms with the Kogane that they're ready to enter and become a player.
  </p>
  <p key="280ddf56-2b15-4357-b039-1801e2e37f12">
   Before the two entered the barrier where the Culling Game was taking place, Megumi tells Yuji they need to beware of incarnated sorcerers from the past which Yuji agrees with him. Yuji asks Megumi to explain to him who is a bit annoyed but nevertheless explains that some of them are from 1,000 years ago but even people from 100 or 200 years ago valued life differently and they're also sorcerers. Fighting to the death used to be a normal thing and they desired it which is likely why they entered into a contract with Kenjaku. Megumi adds on a possibility that Kashimo and Higuruma are past sorcerers so they shouldn't expect any negotiations. Yuji says that aside from them, the cursed spirits are the most aggressive ones at night but a modern-day sorcerer embroiled in the Culling Game like Tsumiki would probably be happy to exchange information.
  </p>
  <p key="cd8775ee-ee70-48f5-9842-8274eaafcd37">
   As the two arrive at the barrier, a Kogane appears and asks them are they willing to become a player and participate in the Culling Game which the Megumi confirms. When the Kogane asks Megumi if he wants to consult the rules, he tells the Kogane that isn't necessary. He then tells Yuji that they will first need information on Higuruma before entering into the barrier.
  </p>
  <p key="2e5fb508-26fb-4b9d-ac0e-035de9c08e9c">
   Now inside the barrier, Yuji falls from the sky and wonders where Megumi is. As he's falling down from the sky, Yuji notices someone stranding atop a building and wonders if that's a player with a light for guidance.
   However, someone from further away atop a building flies into Yuji who is unscathed from the surprise attack. Yuji gets ready to attack and throws a cursed energy infused chunk of the broken building at his attacker who is wounded by the attack. Yuji is surprised by how easily the woman fell but he needs to ask about Higuruma and also find where Megumi is. As he turns around, yet another Culling Game player appears and yells at Yuji, asking him what he did to his woman who says to himself he'll ask the man regarding Higuruma.
  </p>
  <p key="9b0c139f-77c9-403f-808d-bf9f1bbaaf63">
   Yuji throws a chunk of the building at the man who easily blocks it via his propeller-like hair as Yuji charges at the man, suddenly grabbing the individual's leg and throwing him down the building.
   Yuji thinks to himself about how he thought the man would keep the advantage of having the higher ground but instead he only attacks with his propeller. He comes to the conclusion that the man will have to come down to get him and he'll lure him indoors and enters a building via a broken window.
   Yuji waits inside as the man enters with his propeller spinning, telling Yuji he'll make a smoothie out of him. Yuji remains unresponsive and instead charges up his cursed energy in his fist, waiting for the correct time to punch the man's head.
   Suddenly, Yuji's hand squirts out blood as the man laughs, asking Yuji if his fist broke and tells him he's the loser of the fight, however, Yuji surprises the man and kicks him, sending him crashing backwards.
  </p>
  <p key="ad02bd03-c258-4926-a329-d13b51c131d2">
   Yuji shakes his hand and tells the man that it's not broken before walking over to them, asking if they know about a sorcerer named Higuruma. He lowers himself to the man and thinks to himself about when is a good time to ask questions in these type of situations. Someone calls out to him and tells Yuji that he knows the one named Higuruma. The individual greets Yuji and asks him if he remembers who he is who remains confused, wondering how he knows his name and asks who they are. They apologize and says only he'll know who Yuji is because he's famous, he tells Yuji that he's the Tiger of West Junior High which strikes a memory in Yuji who remembers who they were from.
  </p>
  <p key="b158a732-d930-4b93-9a20-9f4430ac2b16">
   As the two walks together, Yuji asks if it's okay for them to be walking together as he was with the other two people who had attacked him earlier. They tell Yuji that he's just a gofer and he would've been killed soon anyway. He introduces himself as Rin Amai where Yuji asks where Higuruma is. Amai tells Yuji that the stronger ones gather where the city used to prosper because that's where plenty of supplies are, telling Yuji that Higuruma is in Ikebukuro. Yuji wonders if Megumi is in Ikebukuro as well.
  </p>
  <p key="96085095-c252-4593-8380-8d14420eeb98">
   Rin tells Yuji that Higuruma uses a theater as a base where Yuji thanks the latter and heads off, only to stop as Rin calls out to him, asking him if he's serious about it. Yuji tells Rin that he needs to meet up with
   <a href="Megumi Fushiguro.html" key="2041ba2b-ff9a-4988-abd8-554676b1e595" title="Megumi Fushiguro">

   </a>
   and he's also in a hurry. Rin tells Yuji he's never met Higuruma but he once beat Haba to a pulp.
   Yuji claims that he'll be fine and that he beat up Haba and comes to the conclusion that if he needs to, he'll be able to run away and leaves. As Yuji enters the theatre, he's surprised to find Higuruma in a bathtub who asks him who he is and what he's doing there which Yuji responds the same way.
   Higuruma asks Yuji if he's ever taken a bath with clothes on where Yuji replies with a no. Higuruma says that it feels better than what he expected, he adds on that when he was in elementary school, he liked the swimming classes where they had to wear clothes, he says that these days he doesn't care about much and that he's challenging himself to do things he previously thought he shouldn't do and went off the rail. He asks Yuji if he finds that funny who says yes. Yuji asks the man if he's Higuruma who confirms and just as Yuji says he wants to talk, Higuruma tells him to wait as he's a lawyer so talking to him costs 5,000 yen every half hour. This confuses Yuji as Higuruma tells him he was merely joking, he says that he wanted to play the money-grubbing lawyer for a change. Yuji comes to the conclusion that there's something odd about Higuruma and goes straight to the point of asking Higuruma if he scored 100 points.
  </p>
  <p key="9499c9fb-71ea-40f6-9bd5-96f7c32f0a30">
   Yuji thinks to himself about how Higuruma isn't an incarnated sorcerer and that he's a modern day sorcerer whose cursed technique has awakened, coming to the conclusion that Higuruma will listen to him and make a deal. Yuji tells Higuruma that they want to put an end to the Culling Game or rather negating the forced killing, asking Higuruma if they can use his 100 points to add a rule.
   Higuruma tells Yuji that he'll be blunt and says no, Yuji, clearly annoyed asks if that's a joke as well. Higuruma tells him that it isn't a joke and that the Culling Game presents possibilities. He says that the law is powerless and asks about the Culling Game's rules, saying that if the power he has received is real, then so are the rules. He continues to add on that if rule breakers got punished according to the natural law without any charges, prosecutions or trials. Asking if wouldn't that be wonderful, saying that he recognizes the rules aren't perfect but he wants to preserve the Culling Game's basic mechanics, so he doesn't want it to end so soon.
  </p>
  <p key="2f7c0252-9c14-4fda-a0c6-85d8419f791e">
   He says that went it comes to rule 2 and 8, he'd like to see cursed technique removal at least once. Yuji tells Higuruma that the cursed technique removal is part of the Culling Game ritual, adding on that if they wait too long, everyone in the country will die. Higuruma tells Yuji that he doubts it and that the Culling Game celebrates permanence. Yuji, nervously thinks to himself about how he doesn't understand that part either before charging up his

   , asking Higuruma to allow him to use his 100 points. Higuruma gets out of the bathtub and asks if he's ever killed someone who annoys themselves, adding that it feels better than what he expected.
  </p>
  <p key="573ca5bf-497a-4209-a960-6e903e31999f">
   Yuji notices something behind Higuruma and wonders if that's a shikigami, he thinks to himself about how Higuruma has 100 points and may have killed 20 sorcerers, so instead of charging, he'll instead start on the defense and will be ready for any attack.
   Higuruma activates domain expansion as Yuji charges at Higuruma with the motive of taking him out before he can activate his cursed technique.
   However, instead of landing a blow on Higuruma, Yuji's foot is stopped a few inches away from Higuruma's face. Higuruma tells Yuji that his domain forbids the use of violence for the both of them. Yuji is sent back to where he once was, confusing him as Higuruma tells him that verbal violence is another matter before asking Judgeman to begin. Judgeman begins by saying Yuji is under suspicion of entering the Maji Vegas Pachinko Parlor on July 16, 2017, in Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture, despite being under 18 years of age at the time. Yuji is confused by this before realizing and thinks to himself. Higuruma tells Yuji that Judgeman knows everything about everyone within the domain, but tells Yuji not to worry and doesn't have that information, telling him that the verdict depends solely upon the arguments that he and Yuji presents.
  </p>
  <p key="50e9b8d1-58a7-45de-9273-a7b00698b323">
   Higuruma pulls out an envelope and says that is evidence of Yuji's crime, telling the surprised Yuji that the envelope has what Judgeman has submitted for the deliberation. He says that the evidence is not necessarily conclusive and Yuji won't be told what it contains and that Yuji must state his case to dispel all doubts and therefore he will win a pronouncement of innocence from Judgeman. Yuji think to himself about how Higuruma is a real lawyer and wonders if his cursed technique is for trials and he's prosecuting him. He thinks back to what something Master Tengen said about domains, coming to the conclusion that Higuruma's domain expansion is not necessarily fatal and can't physically harm him, and that it relies on a binding vow that requires an explanation of the rules. Higuruma tells Yuji that both Yuji and himself have one chance to make a statement. After Yuji's statement, he will offer a rebuttal based on the evidence and then Judgeman will deliver a lawful verdict. Yuji asks what will happen if Judgeman says he's guilty where Higuruma apologizes and says he doesn't have to answer that but he will tell Yuji something else; Yuji has three options, silence, confession, and denial. Adding on that denial may include false statements. Yuji wonders if he can lie in court and Higuruma says that if everyone tells the truth, there will be no need for trials. He tells Yuji to begin his defense and that Judgeman isn't very patient.
  </p>
  <p key="be1078e1-8c32-4add-9a6f-0111c2a1ac14">
   Yuji is silent as he thinks to himself about how he did in fact go to the Pachinko Parlor and pay the machines and thinks that he won, so he thinks that lying is the only way to get off. However, the problem comes in where he isn't aware of what the evidence is. He continues thinking about the options he has: stay silent or deny it if the evidence doesn't proves that he entered the Pachinko Parlor. If the evidence only proves that he entered the parlor, he can say it was for another reason, but if the evidence is like option one, he wouldn't be admitting that he went in, leading to him digging his own grave and finally, if the evidence proves he not only went in but also played then he's basically screwed. He thinks that he could try confessing in hopes of a lighter sentence but wonders if this court even do those sort of things.
   Yuji confirms that he went into the parlor but only to take a dump, thinking to himself about how he refuses choose and doesn't know if he can plead for an extenuating circumstances. Higuruma opens the envelope and pulls out a piece of paper, saying that it's now his turn. The photo which came from inside the envelope shows an image of Yuji from a security camera at a cash exchange window near Maji Vegas on the day in question. He asks if Yuji exhibits the appearance and the build of the accused. Higuruma continues on and says that pairing the photo with his own admission of entering the premises casts Yuji's story about the restroom in doubt, which determines that despite being underaged, Yuji entered with the intent of playing the machines. Yuji is in shock of what he's guilty of as Higuruma continues talking with it being unlawful entry, article 130 penal code and that after all, laws specifically made for entertainment establishments don't allow punishing minors.
  </p>
  <p key="a0c89e6f-ace3-41a6-b89f-d4b10e150281">
   Yuji says that it isn't fair and there wasn't anything he could've said, wondering to himself if he should've chosen option one. Higuruma says that Japan forbids gambling so parlors and cash exchanges are separate legal entities and in some cases, multiple parlors share one exchange but Yuji is only on trial for the parlor. He tells Yuji that he only needed to deny it by saying "I've never seen Pachinko Parlor" before telling him that it's time for the verdict. Judgeman says Yuji is guilty and confiscation.
   The pair are transported out of the domain but Judgeman found Yuji guilty. He says that he doesn't feel any different as Higuruma uses his gavel to land a surprise hit on Yuji and throws his gavel, charging at Yuji only for his hammer to reappear, enlarged which slams into Yuji, throwing him into the seats. Yuji is surprised that Higuruma can make his gavel appear and disappear and can even change sizes. Higuruma comments on how tough Yuji is who replies that's one thing he's got going for himself, but he's unable to control his cursed energy.
  </p>
  <p key="7cd703a9-275b-4899-9739-4edcf8e81492">
   Being unable to use his cursed energy, Yuji is forced to dodge Higuruma's attacks but gets hit a few times. Higuruma stops fighting to ask Yuji if he can't use his cursed energy who is confused by the question but nevertheless confirms thanks to Higuruma. He tells Yuji that the penalty of confiscation temporarily makes it impossible to use

   but he suspects Yuji doesn't have a cursed technique so the effect must've switched to preventing the use of cursed energy. Thinking to himself how frightening to think about.
   Higuruma says that confiscation is usually an additional punishment accompanying another punishment and decides to fight him at full strength.
   Higuruma starts attacking once more where Yuji attempts to run away and snatch Higuruma's gavel but the gavel disappears, Yuji jumps backwards and kicks the bathtub towards Higuruma who easily destroys it, enlarging his gavel and attempts to crush Yuji but he manages to withstand it, surprising Higuruma with Yuji's strength. Underneath the gavel, Yuji is panicking about how bad of a situation it is, wondering how long he can last and he needs his cursed energy back and fast. He thinks about how powerful Higuruma is but there also must be a compensatory weakness.

   Thinking, Yuji thinks up of court trials and tells Higuruma that he wants a retrial, transporting the two of them back into Higuruma's domain.
   Higuruma comments on how Yuji is starting to understanding it while Yuji is on his knees, thinking about how close that was and asks if he's allowed to get a second trial. Yuji gets back up and demands for a second trial which Judgeman responds with the following crime: Yuji Itadori stands accused of mass murder in Shibuya on October 31, 2018.
   Yuji confirms that he did it and says he's not lying nor will he deny it, surprising Higuruma as Judgeman calls out guilty, confiscation and death penalty.

   Higuruma's gavel transforms into the executioner's sword who readies himself to kill Yuji. He says that every time he tried to help another person, the thought of the word ugly and says that it includes Yuji, continuing on to say that all people are weak and ugly, no matter high-minded a soul he aspire to.
   He yells at Yuji that there's nothing more to it, the darkness before his eyes is just darkness and that even if Yuji can shine a light, all he'll see is more emptiness before himself. Higuruma goes to attack Yuji but he had removes his shirt to act as a decoy amongst the chairs, attempting to attack Higuruma from behind by tripping him but Higuruma dodges his attack.
   Yuji goes to punch Higuruma in the gut which sends him crashing into the seats who remains there, saying article 39 clause 1 of the penal code. The absence of reason and or control signifies non composmentis and that Sukuna possessed his body. Yuji asks him how does he knows of this, saying that he couldn't control himself and he didn't abandon self-control voluntarily. Higuruma finishes Yuji's sentence by saying that he's innocent and that he didn't commit that crime.
  </p>
  <p key="f02f27d3-990f-4745-bb7b-9daf71207f23">
   Yuji tells Higuruma that even if he didn't commit that crime, it's still his fault because he was too weak. Higuruma continues staring up at the ceiling as Yuji asks why he dispelled his cursed technique who tells Yuji he remembered why he got into law in the first place. He says that there may still be lots of people who are weak like Yuji, and tells him to put his clothes back on and sit down as he'll give Yuji the 100 points.
   Yuji goes to grab his hoodie and sits down as he puts it back on where Higuruma asks if he's killed anyone of his own free will who confirms as Higuruma asks if it felt awful.
  </p>
  <p key="47ebb9e0-c119-4428-a024-c6e13ef65971">
   Higuruma asks for the kogane to add a rule: making it possible to transfer points between players. He says that this will affect the calculation of scores for rule 8 as the kogane approves of the new rule. Yuji lets out a sigh of relief as Higuruma orders the kogane to give Yuji one of his points and tells Yuji that now neither of them will be subjected to cursed technique removal for 19 days. Higuruma gets out of his seat and says goodbye as Yuji asks what he's going to do now and asks if Higuruma will help them. Higuruma tells him that his two left over points are from the judge and prosecutor he killed before coming to Tokyo and when the barrier opens, he'll turn himself in. Until then, he'll ponder his course of action and adds on that if he stayed with Yuji, he'll just hate himself more and apologizes that he wasn't criticizing Yuji.
   As Higuruma leaves and shuts the door behind himself, Yuji is left standing there.
