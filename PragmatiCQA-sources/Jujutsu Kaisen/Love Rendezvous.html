   Love Rendezvous assigns five "stars★" with a Southern Cross motif in order to target cursed energy. The five stars are ★Imai, ★Acrux, ★Mimosa, ★Ginan, and ★Gacrux.
  </p>
  <p key="5d281fc9-5312-46d4-936d-b0cbee6dc280">
   In order to mark something with a star, the user must make physical contact with someone's cursed energy. Anyone that has been marked will experience a sparking light above their head when the technique is activated. They can also find the name of the star they've been marked with written somewhere on their body.
  </p>
  <p key="c748f0e6-a0db-4923-852d-0ddd06bc7427">
   Only one star can be placed on one person's cursed energy at a time but the same star can be applied to multiple different people's cursed energy. This includes the user, so if they've marked themself with a star, they must remove it before using their cursed energy to mark another object. If the user needs to mark multiple different objects with stars, the objects need to be charged by someone else's cursed energy beforehand.

   and their shikigami is considered the same by Love Rendezvous. The user can mark both the shikigami user and their familiar with a star at the same time. They can even place a star on the sorcerer without touching them directly, simply by making contact with the shikigami. The one with the higher cursed energy output will pull the other when attracted.

   Anyone appointed with a star must follow a sequential order if they want to attempt approaching another star. Otherwise, they will be unable to close the distance between them and a target with the same star will be attracted to them and unable to separate. The determined route is organized based on stars in the constellation from nearest to the furthest distance from the earth. The order is as follows: 
★Imai → ★Acrux → ★Mimosa → ★Ginan → ★Gacrux.
   (i.e. Someone marked with ★Acrux must go through ★Mimosa and ★Ginan before reaching ★Gacrux.)

   and Panda, they immediately marked Megumi and themselves with stars. Megumi made the first move and tried to restrain Kirara with

   </a>
   , but Kirara marked the shikigami with a star as soon as they made contact, forcing it to attract back to Megumi. Panda was marked beforehand, which is why he was unable to approach the door in the first place. Kirara ran for the monitor room door after effectively repelling the shikigami only to have their route impeded by Divine Dog. This time Megumi was attracted to Divine Dog, confusing Megumi on how this cursed technique worked.
  </p>
  <p key="06d7628a-fd94-4826-adc3-efd662f3e233">
   Megumi summoned

    Rabbit Escape
   </a>
   , a massive torrent of rabbits to flood the roof and see where Kirara's technique was allowing him to approach. He noticed every rabbit was already marked with ★Acrux and the monitor room door was marked with ★Gacrux. Kirara believed summoning so many rabbits was dangerous to Megumi because if they all attracted back to him, he would suffocate to death. Megumi quickly dispelled the Rabbit Escape before this happened and analyzed his results. He found his abdomen marked with ★Acrux and Panda's backside was marked with ★Imai. This helped him successfully guess that Kirara's cursed technique was based on the Southern Cross constellation, forcing Kirara to consider that he was likely going to figure out how it works.
  </p>
  <p key="0ec514aa-2966-49d9-b65f-10808c5d2fb4">
   Panda and Megumi could get near each other without issue, disproving Megumi's initial theory that Love Rendezvous apportioned each of them with a star on the cross in order to maintain a certain distance between each point. His next theory was much closer, he compared the technique to a board game with a determined route and figured out there was a fifth star in the Southern Cross they needed to find before approaching Kirara.
  </p>
  <p key="474bd07e-532b-4608-9d98-e76b23d3f213">
   Knowing their enemy had sufficient enough evidence now to satisfy the conditions of the technique, Kirara went on the offensive. They jumped on the hood of the car and marked it. Assigned Imai, the same symbol as Panda, the back of the car was flung upward by Kirara's attack and sent directly at Panda. Since ★Imai couldn't approach Kirara's ★Ginan without touching the stars in between the first, the car was rejected and instantly attracted to Panda, who made the mistake of trying to toss it away. The car was immediately attracted back to Panda, smashing him in the head and incapacitating him.
  </p>
  <p key="5a83f78c-5320-43de-9c19-e47cd3febbc9">
   Megumi focused on searching for residuals across the rooftop and correctly deduced that Kirara was marking cursed energy instead of objects themselves with their technique. He also realized that Kirara had to mark objects already charged with someone else's cursed energy because a star was already applied to theirs. Megumi finds the missing star, ★Mimosa, attached to a parking stop and touches it, allowing him to approach Kirara per the rules of the technique. He believes Kirara won't be able to throw objects at him using ★Acrux as long as Kirara's cursed energy is already marked with ★Ginan. However, Kirara removed ★Ginan from themselves and attached ★Acrux to several objects, sending them all attracting to Megumi.
  </p>
  <p key="07450b22-cef3-447f-9ef0-5c712f1a96e6">
   Several parking stops and a car door hit Megumi, but Divine Dog got to them from behind. Megumi was able to outsmart Kirara by tricking them into thinking he had dispelled Divine Dog. He maneuvered so there was a wall on the roof between them, jamming his shikigami against it so they could temporarily separate. Divine Dog was set loose once Megumi got Kirara directly in between them, attracting the shikigami to Megumi and allowing it to grab Kirara on the way there, forcing them to deactivate Love Rendezvous.
  </p>
  <p key="a646a129-46bf-423a-a34c-be2be7865805">
   Kirara was in disbelief that Megumi could've planned that because it was unlikely he could've also correctly guessed whether he or Divine Dog would've gotten pulled. Megumi admitted he gambled but this helped him realize that the one with the higher output of cursed energy attracts the other. In their first experience, Divine Dog pulled Megumi, but when Megumi reinforced himself with cursed energy to defend, the opposite occurred.
