   When Toji was still with the Zenin Family, he went to see

   out of curiosity and was surprised that Gojo was able to notice him.
   Due to his lack of Cursed Energy and relience on weapons Toji would be seen as inferior by many of his relatives. Despite this

   In 2006, Toji meets
   Shiu Kong
   , a member of the

    Time Vessel Association
   </a>
   , and accepts a job to assassinate the Star Plasma Vessel.
   Later at a race track, Toji met with Shiu, informing them that he had used their money to put a bounty on
   <a href="Riko Amanai.html" key="d6c9a017-6e17-4bea-af65-6108031be342" title="Riko Amanai">
    Riko Amanai
   </a>
   . The intention begin that hitmen and assassins would slowly wear Gojo down before Toji made his move. The deadline for the bounty is designed to cause Riko's bodyguards to relax and not expect another attack. After listening to Toji, Shiu leaves but not before asking Toji how Megumi was doing. Toji responds by asking who that person is.

  <p key="c7ad517c-cb23-4530-a065-64a18fcccb8f">
   On the day Riko is to merge with

   , and Riko head into the college. When Gojo tells Toji that the bounty was taken down, Toji reveals he was the mastermind and only used it to weaken his opponents. Toji manages to evade all of Gojo's attacks and slip from sight. Gojo, unable to sense his target, clears the battlefield to gain a clear line of sight, only for Toji to release a insect swam to block Gojo's view. Attacking from Gojo's blind spot, Toji stabs him in the throat
   before slashing and stabbing him. Toji then claims he is finally back in the swing of things as Gojo lies on the ground bleeding to death.
  </p>
  <p key="594174e7-67bf-4c2b-a687-60b4e8b25293">
   After taking care of Gojo, Toji uses footprints and his enhanced senses to track Riko and the others before shooting Riko in the head with a handgun. When a shocked Geto asks how Toji was there, Toji then says that he has killed Gojo and Geto attacks in anger.
   While they fight Toji explains to Geto how he was able to remain invisible at the college and even how he fights. Geto does not care and instead wants to know about how he tracked them down and what happened to
   <a href="Misato Kuroi.html" key="4122654e-a439-49ea-9c59-8c4c89ddd16d" title="Misato Kuroi">

   . Toji admits he took care of her but doesn't know if she is alive. While Geto briefly gets the advantage and tries to cripple the assassin by
   stealing
   his curse and tools. Toji easily manages to defeat the spirits and cuts Geto down. Deciding not to kill Geto due to the risk of freeing his curses, Toji kicks him and tells him that all their magic was useless in stopping someone with no powers. He then remembers that Megumi is his son and why he chose the name.
  </p>
  <p key="c85a98d5-c379-4e94-b23a-b05742907075">
   Toji then takes Riko's dead body to the Time Vessel Association base to be verified. Toji and his employer then leave after the association transfers the money to their account. Outside the Association's base, Toji is shocked to encounter Gojo. Having used

    Reverse Cursed Technique
   </a>
   to heal himself, a delirious and manic Gojo explains how he figured out the technique and how Toji almost killing him helped him master his abilities.
   Toji takes Gojo on but is easily overwhelmed. While quickly analyzing Gojo's abilities to formulate a counter plan, Toji is utterly blindsided by a technique combining Gojo's different abilities into a completely new and unpredictable attack:
   <a href="Hollow Technique Purple.html" key="2f264427-5d92-4141-a2e8-ff9c3568ac07" title="Hollow Technique: Purple">
    Hollow Technique: Purple
   </a>
   . The attack fatally wounds Toji before he can fight back. As he slowly dies, Gojo asks if Toji has any last words. After some thought Toji tells his killer that Megumi will be sold to the Zenin family and to do whatever he wanted with that information.
   This causes Gojo to track down Megumi with the intention of telling him about his father.

   , the grandson's personality is suddenly overwritten by Toji, much to Ogami's shock. Toji explains that copying his body was a mistake because his body is special and that if his orders are to kill sorcerers, he'll start with Ogami and attacks her.
   Because Ogami's Séance continues even after her death and her grandson's lack of cursed energy, Toji remains active. His sole reason to exist being to mindlessly fight until his body is destroyed, hunting down the strongest opponent closest to him to kill them.

   Toji then turns his attention to Megumi and drags him to another location to fight him.
   Megumi tries to create a cover with his Escape Rabbit technique, but Toji easily gets past it and attacks. Megumi dodges Toji's attack and quickly runs to an alley. Toji chases after Megumi and attacks, but misses because he steps in the trap that Megumi had created. Megumi goes to stab Toji, but Toji easily manages to get away. Toji, seemingly regaining his senses, asks for Megumi's name, which Megumi tells him. Toji is glad that Megumi didn't take in the Zenin name and stabs himself in the head, destroying his vessel and ending the fight.
