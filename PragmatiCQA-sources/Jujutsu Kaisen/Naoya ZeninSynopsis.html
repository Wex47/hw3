   Naoya notices his immense presence, immediately presenting himself as an ally and asking Yuta not to tell anyone else that he was here.
  </p>
  <p key="293aca52-85d4-4f8f-9750-0d923aae02e4">
   Naoya makes use of the situation and attacks Choso as Yuta chases after Yuji. During the initial scuffle, he comments that he knows about

   and Choso has no way of winning.
   The fight is taken into an underground passage, where Naoya seemingly overpowers Choso. The curse-human attempts to use

   : Stack to turn the tables,
   but the Zenin family member manages to counter by stabbing Choso and hoping he bleeds out. After that sneak attack, Naoya makes an off-handed comment about his brothers which prompts Choso to talk about the value of brotherly bonds.
  </p>
  <p key="5001422f-971e-4195-bf5d-f8b6b63052af">
   Choso then makes use of the fact he's half-curse and launches his blood towards Naoya in a giant wave. The Zenin family member attempts to dodge, but some blood eventually gets on his clothes and Choso then defeats him with

   , managing to poison him with his blood in the process. Before Choso could finish his opponent off, Yuta arrives and knocks the curse-human out. Okkotsu, who carries Yuji's unconscious body behind him, then comments that Naoya looks hurt.
  </p>
  <p key="3b5b8950-6b59-4730-8d33-0efaef2bd0e0">
   Naoya feels insulted by Yuta staring down at him, but a sudden pain causes him to vomit. The Zenin family member is bewildered, not understanding right away why his body reacted this way. As he understands that Choso must not have been human, Yuta offers to heal him in exchange for informing the higher-ups of Itadori's death. Naoya presumably accepted the deal and left Shibuya.

   Now in a different room, Naoya talks to Jinichi as he says he's too reckless and that Megumi is the better choice.
   While the two are chatting, the alarm sounds as Naoya wonders why there's so much noise. Ranta who suddenly rushes in informs the two that Maki has gone mad and also has killed

  <p key="7f064f70-0779-4f71-acfc-15ba4457b536">
   After both the Kukuru and Hei units are slaughtered by Maki, Naoya arrives and confronts her after she throws Jinichi's head into the water, asking if she has a human heart. Maki responds by saying she no longer has a heart as it was taken from her.

  <p key="6bb21b5c-b2c8-495b-ae95-554bcb1da194">
   Naoya immediately attacks Maki with a barrage of punches who's able to block all of them. Naoya manages to grab Maki's arm and uses

   He continues attacking Maki who's unable to fight back. Naoya decides to use his speed to try and pierce Maki, however, much to his surprise, Maki prepares to use Shiranui-Gata. Instead of directly attacking Maki, Naoya slaps her and gets behind her preparing to attack. However, Maki surprises him and slams him into the ground, leaving him bleeding and wounded.

   After Maki leaves, Naoya tries to crawl to safety, gloating to himself that she didn't finish him off. However, Maki's mother, who was also on the verge of death, walked up to Naoya from behind and stabbed him in the back. At this point Naoya was too weak to use cursed energy to defend himself, so he was killed without putting up a fight.
