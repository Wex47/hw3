   Nanami continues to fight Mahito, which results in Mahito injuring Nanami.
   Once it hits 6 o'clock, Nanami wraps his tie around his hand
   and starts to explain how his technique works. Nanami then uses his technique on a wall so that a large amount of rubble falls on top of them. As Mahito watches the rubble, Nanami uses his technique on him to injure his leg and retreats.

   comes through the portal.
   After Toji comes through the portal, Nanami asks about the portal but Megumi says that the portal has closed. Nanami then watches as Toji takes on Dagon. While watching, Nanami asks Megumi if he can last for a little while longer since they have to rely on Toji which Megumi replies that he can last for a little bit longer.
   When Toji exorcises Dagon, Nanami thinks about how they only survived because Toji had arrived but also wonders if Toji is on their side.

   since Jogo is stronger than Dagon. Nanami is then easily taken out by Jogo.
   Nanami manages to get up, but is severely wounded and on the brink of death, but continues onward regardless. When Nanami comes across a large amount of mutated humans, Nanami thinks about how he could spend his time living in Malaysia and reading since he is so tired. Nanami then worries about Maki, Megumi, and Naobito and wonders what happened to them. Nanami then takes on the mutated humans and is confronted by Mahito. The two have a small chat and Nanami wonders what he is trying to do. Suddenly he sees Haibara, who points right. Nanami turns and sees Yuji. Nanami tells Yuji that he has it here before Mahito goes to kill Nanami.
