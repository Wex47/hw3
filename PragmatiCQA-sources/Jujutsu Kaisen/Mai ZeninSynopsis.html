   Suddenly Mai is confronted by Maki, Mai plans to fight Maki alone instead of calling for backup. As Mai fires shots at Maki, Maki easily cuts them in half. As Maki manages to close the distance, Mai fires more bullets but Maki easily counters them. After Mai fires all six shots from her revolver, Maki starts to close the distance again before Mai can reload. When Maki gets close enough, Mai uses her cursed technique that allows for her to construct another bullet but at the cost of her cursed energy and fires it at Maki. Maki manages to catch it, and Mai is defeated. Mai suddenly tells Maki that she would have been fine working as a servant to the clan as long as Maki was with her, which Maki responds by saying that she would have regretted it. As Maki leaves, Mai remembers how her sister said that she won't leave her and calls her a liar.

During the game when Maki hits Aoi with the ball, Mai, alongside with the rest of the Tokyo and Kyoto students, tells Maki that that was a good pitch.

   When Ogi leaves, Mai manages to stand up and moves to Maki where she senses a heartbeat. Mai comments on how tough Maki is before adding on how she suspected this would happen someday. She then leans down to Maki and they both transfer to an unknown location metaphorically presented as a beach.
   Mai says that her injuries are too heavy for her to survive what she is planning to do, and starts to walk away into the ocean. At first Maki doesn't understand what Mai is doing, so she calls out for her sister. Mai explains that given that they were born twins, their cursed potential is tied to each of them, and for Maki to evolve, Mai will need to want to do the same. As long as Mai, who is not planning on becoming stronger, is alive and stagnant, Maki will remain where she is too. Mai admits to Maki, that for her to grow, Mai will have to die. She takes away all of their cursed energy and gives Maki a parting gift — a reed branch. Mai asks Maki to destroy everything. When Maki comes to her senses back in the training room, she tries to wake Mai up, but her sister is dead. In her hands, instead of what used to be a reed branch, Maki finds a new weapon. After propping Mai against the wall, exorcising all the curses in the room and killing Ogi, Maki addresses her dead sister, saying that she's getting started on fulfilling the promise.
