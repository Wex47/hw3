   Later Geto is in the classroom with Gojo and Shoko, where Geto and Gojo discuss the importance of putting up a screen. Geto and Gojo then get into an argument about the strong protecting weak, resulting in a fight. Masamichi then shows up and assigns Geto and Gojo a mission from

   As they arrive at the location to pick up the vessel for the mission, an explosion happens, and the vessel falls to the ground. Before the vessel hits the ground, Geto manages to save her with Gojo's help. A Q soldier,
   Kokun
   , then confront Geto. Geto easily defeats Kokun, and even shows Kokun that Gojo has defeated his comrade. When

   wakes up, Geto and Gojo introduce themselves to her. They then start to talk, which Riko explains why she is so spunky even though she is willing to fuse with Tengen.
  </p>
  <p key="be59078c-fecd-430f-a6d0-3eb1b3e244cd">
   Riko then has them take her to her Junior High, which they contact Masamichi about their circumstance. After talking with Masamichi, they check on the surveillance spirit, which Geto tells Gojo that two have been exorcised. Geto heads out to deal with the intruders while Gojo and Misato look for Riko. Geto manages to encounter one of the intruders, who manages to figure out what Geto's ability is. Geto easily defeats the intruder and starts to interrogate him.
  </p>
  <p key="d0c1b24b-372a-4118-96c3-7aff0bd8bbc3">
   After finishing his interrogation, Geto meets up with Misato and asks about Riko. When another intruder escapes from the school, Geto calls Gojo and informs him about the situation. When Misato is kidnapped, Geto meets up with Gojo and Riko to discuss what they will do next.
  </p>
  <p key="74e6a2c9-8adf-4abb-887a-a0b9c1d16736">
   The three decide to rescue Misato, and meet with the kidnappers in Okinawa. Once they arrive at Okinawa, they manage to save Misato and choose to have some fun in Okinawa before heading back. Geto talks with Gojo about why the kidnappers wanted the exchange to happen in Okinawa until it's time for them to head back. Riko manages to convince them to stay for one more day. Geto asks if Gojo is okay since he has been using his technique non-stop for days. Gojo tells Geto that he is doing fine, and they continue to have fun. The next day, the four head back to the college and they are attacked when they arrive at the site.
  </p>
  <p key="6637dbe3-ffdc-4a09-a88f-03aa203ec320">
   Geto quickly takes Riko and Misato into the college and leads them to the Tombs of the Star Corridor. Once they reach the tombs, Geto and Riko part ways from Misato and enter the tombs' main hall. Geto explains to Riko where she can reach Tengen, but also explains how he won't stop her if she wants to leave. When Riko decides that she still wants to leave, Geto prepares to escort her out, but Toji shoots Riko. Geto wonders why Toji is here, which Toji explains how he has killed Gojo. Geto summons spirits and has them attack Toji. Toji manages to defeat the spirits and even manages to wound Geto.
  </p>
  <p key="98479c57-29af-43fb-9830-4e0704416d2a">
   When Toji leaves with Riko's body, Geto gets healed by Shoko and heads out to the Star Religious Group's base. Once Geto reaches the base, he finds out that not only Toji is dead but that Gojo has retrieved Riko's body. Before they leave, Geto says that they should take care of everyone there, but Gojo tells him that it doesn't matter since the group would be disbanded soon anyway.
  </p>
  <p key="f06679d0-4d8b-44ca-ab9f-1252fb4bd270">
   A year later, Geto, along with Shoko, is helping out Gojo with his new technique. Geto and Shoko become curious about the technique, and Gojo explains how the technique works and how he can have it continuously active without it harming him. Afterwards, Geto thinks about how strong Gojo has become and that he has recently started going on missions alone. Later Geto is thinking about who he is doing all of this for, when he meets

   Geto and Yuki talk about how they can stop cursed spirits from being created, which Yuki tells him that she has managed to figure out two ways for that to happen. After talking, the two part ways. Later Geto meets with Nanami in the morgue and hears about how

   Sometime later, Geto meets with Shoko in Shinjuku and explains that he plans to kill all non-shamans. When Shoko has Gojo come to Shinjuku, Geto meets with Gojo and explains why he is doing this. After explaining everything to Gojo, Geto walks away. Later Geto meets with most of the former Star Religious group members and explains to him that he will be taking over. He even kills one of them to make his point across.

   Days later, Geto is helping out a woman that is cursed by a spirit. The woman expresses how grateful she is that the curse has been exorcised and leaves, in which Geto expresses his true feelings towards non-shamans. One of Geto's followers show up and informs him that the others have arrived. As Geto and his follower head to the meeting, one of Geto's donators, Kanemori, suddenly show up. Kanemori complains that Geto needs to perform an exorcism on him since he has donated so much.

   Geto's follower informs Geto that Kanemori donated between 50 to 100 million, but no donation has been made for half a year. Geto then kills Kanemori and heads to the meeting. Geto meeting with his fellow shamans and informs them that they will take on the magic college soon.

   Later Geto arrives at the magic college along with his shaman allies. Geto quickly greets Yuta and explains why he wants to create a shaman only world, which Yuta disagrees with. The faculty suddenly shows up and asks why Geto is here, which Geto says that he will release 2000 spirits all over Japan on December 24th. Geto then leaves with his followers but leaves some cursed spirits for the college to handle.

   On December 24th, Geto arrives at the Tokyo College to obtain special-class spirit Rika. Geto kills all that get in his way and puts a screen over the college. Geto then encounters Maki, Panda, and Toge, which he easily defeats the three. As Geto is glad that shamans are defending each other, Yuta shows up and becomes enraged at what Geto had done to his friends. Geto sends multiple spirits at Yuta and Rika, which Yuta takes this time to rescue his friends and heal them. As Yuta returns to the fight, Geto releases more spirits, but Yuta uses Rika's power to trounce them.

  <p key="cea193c6-fc98-42c5-aae8-0be047cc2a20">
   Geto manages to figure out what Rika's power is and expresses a desire for Rika even more. Geto then takes Yuta on in close combat and overwhelms him, which Rika gets Yuta away from Geto. All the while Geto is facing Yuta, he expresses his view on the non-shamans. Yuta rushes at Geto, which Geto manages to break Yuta's katana. Geto then gets punched by Yuta and listens as Yuta expresses his desire. Geto decides to use all his spirits on Yuta, which Yuta responds by releasing Rika's power at Geto. Geto's spirits are all exorcised, and Geto's arm is blasted off.

The duo would later place one of Sukuna's fingers inside Junpei's apartment, causing a cursed spirit to kill Junpei's mother. Exploiting Junpei’s friendship with Mahito and grief to convince him this attack was arranged by a classmate. After unlocking Junpei’s cursed energy, Mahito and Noritoshi watch as he attacks his classmates. Mahito placed the barrier over the school to prevent weak humans from existing or entering, as Noritoshi is hiding his residuals. The plan being that if Junpei and Yuji fight it will force Yuji to make a binding vow with Sukuna, which would help them convince Sukuna to work with them. Noritoshi left after the conversation. The plan would ultimately fail due to Sukuna’s own interests and Mahito would flee the scene.

Still, Geto informs Mahito that sometimes terrible will happen to them if they break their vow with Kokichi. When Kokichi heals and starts a fight with Mahito, Geto offers to help, but Mahito declines. As Kokichi and Mahito begin their fight, Geto gets a distance away and watches the fight. As Geto watches the battle, he thinks about how Kokichi is temporarily using a special-grade level of cursed energy firepower to counter Mahito. After witnessing Kokichi use the technique multiple times, he figures out that Kokichi uses the Simple Domain technique and thinks about how the technique works.

Gojo, reaching the limit of what he is willing to sacrifice in battle, uses his domain expansion for less than a second to stun everyone in the area. Gojo spends the next 5 minutes killing the transfigured humans. Exhausted and mentally drained, he is shocked by Geto's Prison Realm opening. As he turns to flee, Geto makes his appearance.
