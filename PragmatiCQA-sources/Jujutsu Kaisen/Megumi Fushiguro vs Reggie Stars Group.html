   Megumi happens upon Remi soon after entering the Tokyo No. 1 Colony barrier. She attacks him but he easily overpowers her by knocking her down. He laments being separated from

  </p>
  <p key="029a9f22-d005-4061-931e-844ec479c59e">
   They get off at a subway station in Ikebukuro where Megumi stops for a moment before they continue. Remi told him that Higuruma was in Shinjuku, and Megumi believes moving through Ikebukuro to get there is a bad idea. Resources are plentiful in Ikebukuro, increasing the likelihood they run into other players.
  </p>
  <p key="42b2596e-ddaf-4594-8c0c-9597766018d6">
   Remi explains why she chose this route for two reasons, claiming it's the simplest and that she has on the way. She requests that they go to the base so she can shower after not resting for a day.
   They arrive at an apartment building where Megumi comes face to face with another player. He asks if this person is Higuruma, but he introduces himself as Reggie and reveals that Remi tricked Megumi.
  </p>
  <p key="534f301e-485f-438a-909c-eed46660365d">
   Irate, Megumi scowls at Remi and she tries to taunt him in return by boasting about Reggie's strength. Megumi interrupts her, telling her to shut up because they're wasting time, all while summoning

   Reggie claps and commends Megumi's strength, claiming he's passed their test. Apparently, Megumi's

   is a sufficient show of strength for Reggie. Otherwise, he would kill him for points.
  </p>
  <p key="e1b5c585-7369-46f1-91e9-b85b33c432aa">
   Remi never realized Reggie was intent on gathering strong allies. Reggie tries to recruit Megumi and asks how much he knows about the Culling Game. Refraining from mentioning

   , Megumi replies that it's a ritual for taking Japanese people to the other side so they're no longer human. This answer amuses Reggie and prompts him to ask if Megumi knows

   . Megumi is surprised to hear Reggie mention Kenjaku by name, but Megumi figured he would eventually run into a

   with a connection to Kenjaku.
  </p>
  <p key="64f518f2-e1d2-4de5-af66-1a4e7c20b86e">
   Reggie believes the ritual explanation is simply a secondary goal or a bluff altogether. The Culling Game reached a deadlock in under two weeks and most of the weak players were weeded out. In contrast, a drawn-out melee between numerous players would be best for a ritual that uses the
   <a href="Cursed Energy.html" key="34aa1a61-ebd8-44e2-935e-593509bfd985" title="Cursed Energy">

   </a>
   of the players. Additionally, each Colony has players like Higuruma with overwhelming strength. Reggie believes that when only the strong remain, Kenjaku will reveal the true purpose of the Culling Game. He doesn't know what this revelation might entail, so Reggie is storing up allies and points.
  </p>
  <p key="79a0c37c-b6f6-4c06-b8a4-df9bc590cedd">
   Megumi questions why Remi is in the group if she's so weak and Reggie replies that people let their guards down around attractive women. Megumi asks if she'll be eliminated when she has no use but Reggie claims he would never eliminate Remi for her points. Remi believes that Reggie is her knight and he'll protect her as long as she does well.
  </p>
  <p key="176c049f-dce5-4569-8b8c-b901ecd1802b">
   Megumi asks if Reggie's group's point total is at least a hundred, which Reggie confirms. Megumi reveals a new rule will be added to the Culling Game that allows players to give each others points. He demands that Reggie and his allies hand over all their points and states that only then will he consider joining them. Reggie declares that the negotiation has broken down and signals an ambush to begin.

   Chizuru Hari suddenly dashes out of a corridor behind Megumi and tries to surprise attack him. Hari changes his fingers into dark-colored claws and attempts to slash Megumi's face. However, Megumi disappears just before the claws hit, surprising both Reggie and Hari. Megumi reappears beneath Hari's legs, hiding within his shadow.
  </p>
  <p key="5d1a8912-a9da-4a04-bf6d-fa0ed63292b7">
   While Divine Dog: Totality attacks Reggie, Megumi lifts Hari above his head and throws him over the side of the building. While Hari is falling, Megumi points down and orders

   to divebomb his opponent. Hari is electrified by Nue's wings and gets slammed down several stories directly into the ground below. Remi looks down at Hari over the balcony, not having previously realized that Megumi had Nue out the entire time. Megumi gets her attention, scowling and threatening her to never cross his path again.
  </p>
  <p key="e72c513b-f773-4bb3-b57e-0fe24c6451a6">
   Divine Dog is injured by two kitchen knives that have been shoved into the roof of its mouth. Megumi didn't expect his Divine Dog to be overpowered and turns around to see his shikigami writhing in pain. Reggie states he can tell his opponent is holding back and reminds Megumi that if he doesn't fight to kill, he'll end up dead. As if on cue, a detached eyeball falls from the floor above Megumi and suddenly explodes.
  </p>
  <p key="d45775a7-cc24-4f88-b690-49540f41c3aa">
   The explosion blasts Megumi, having taken him by surprise. Nearly caught in the blast, Reggie reminds Iori Hazenoki, who's standing on the roof three stories above them, to watch for collateral damage. Megumi gets out of the smoke created by the blast and has to immediately dodge an attack from Remi. She tries to stab him with her scorpion tail-like hair but he ducks under it in time. He wraps her hair around his back and throws the girl to the ground, before yelling at her, asking if she's had enough yet. Hazenoki swings down to their level while Reggie throws three receipt papers like projectiles from the other side of the smoke. The receipts transform into gasoline and splash Megumi, who's able to identify the liquid by its smell. Then Hazenoki throws three of his teeth at Megumi and Remi before detonating them, resulting in a massive explosion.
  </p>
  <p key="4b5b0b3e-da36-4f92-bd64-3d6c776d069e">
   Successfully hidden from the explosion, Reggie comes out of one of the rooms and asks if their opponent's finished. Hazenoki reveals that like Reggie, Megumi ducked into one of the rooms before the explosion hit. Reggie admits that Megumi is good but he's sure that these explosions have worn him down. At the same time, Megumi lifts up a broken door off of him and Remi. He tells her that Reggie's group would never protect her and to just leave. Megumi begins to walk away but Remi stabs him in the side with her hair, only serving to irritate him. Remi needs Megumi to say he'll protect her but he refuses and calls her trash who cares more about words than actual deeds.
  </p>
  <p key="36daa221-9359-4fbc-8b28-fad398131c0d">
   Hari interrupts them, having returned to the battle after recovering from Nue's attack. He commends Megumi for overpowering him earlier and also states how he's in rough shape now. Megumi knows a four-on-one fight is going to be tough but his train of thought is interrupted by an announcement

   . A tenth rule has been added to the Cullin Game, which allows players to transfer points between one another. With his mission complete, Megumi smirks and gets his second wind. Hari doesn't understand the significance of that rule and Megumi immediately attacks while he's distracted. Megumi throws a high right kick that Hari blocks, but Megumi quickly follows up by summoning

  <p key="921a911f-e81c-4e5b-8d59-8686b6de91f5">
   Max Elephant's sheer size forces Hari outside of the building and Megumi follows him by using Nue to carry him through the air. Megumi mounts Hari while he's falling and bashes his face in with several hits from the hilt of his sword. Hari crashes to the ground with his face severely injured from Megumi's assault. Relentless, Megumi finishes off his opponent by slashing his face open with his sword, eliminating him from the Culling Game. Megumi knows his group will need points in the future but now he's assured his sister won't have to participate. He focuses on trusting his allies and waving away any difficulties that may impede his path.
  </p>
  <p key="2c071da6-3944-4ed7-b76b-5f48d882c7ab">
   Reggie creates two umbrellas for him and Hazenoki to use to descend to the ground. He's disgusted with Hari for dying before even revealing his

   . Megumi notices that Remi isn't in the fight anymore but he's still wary from suffering a direct hit from the first explosion and two-on-one is still not to his advantage. He considers using

   but it's still incomplete and can't trap his opponents. Hazenoki suddenly spits a severed tooth from his mouth directly at Megumi. However, a newcomer appears and takes the brunt of the explosion for Megumi.

   </a>
   , a player with zero points who tells everyone involved to be careful. He doesn't think two against one is very fair and calls Reggie and Hazenoki cowards. Takaba also adds that cowardly attacks don't work and that he's suffered zero-damage, all while bleeding from the head and clearly injured from the explosion.
  </p>
  <p key="2b494b71-8cae-4913-a7d5-65366bd72a8f">
   Takaba tells Megumi that he'll help him even the odds and claims that at thirty-five years old, he can tell if someone's good or bad by their face. He turns to actually look at Megumi and realizes he has a bad face but claims it's all "revisionist". Megumi tries to correct him but Takaba just starts posing. Megumi is confused, but Takaba protected him so he's willing to trust the eccentric newcomer.
  </p>
  <p key="10feaa4c-534d-4811-9949-50bec8e2a502">
   Reggie asks if Hazenoki can infer which time period the newcomer is from. Hazenoki believes it's faster to just ask and tries to do so by asking "which are you?". However, Takaba takes this as Hazenoki questioning whether he's funny or not and decides to tell a joke. Reggie and Hazenoki prepare for an attack but Takaba just says "marry me and be my wi-fi".
  </p>
  <p key="79a71f04-6f4e-4fe8-b606-452125fc99d7">
   This awkwardly unfunny joke gets silence from everyone, including Megumi. Despite not getting the response he was looking for, Takaba remains determined and declares that he's an entertainer, abruptly dropkicking Hazenoki into a building. Reggie recognizes Takaba's massive shift in cursed energy output and realizes that he's actually strong.
