   . Due to her inability to see cursed spirits, Maki was often seen as the bravest of the two twins. Maki wanted to become stronger even with her inability to see cursed spirits, so she left the Zenin family in order to hone her skills, but only after declaring she will become the head of the family someday. However, the Zenin clan sought to stifle her efforts at every stage, going as far as to prevent her promotion from a grade 4 sorcerer, despite her obvious talent.

After the war, Yuta released the curse on Rika, finding him to be a very talented sorcerer, Yuta remained as a classmate with his friends.

   Maki takes on Miwa, but asks why Miwa wants to fight alone. Miwa tells her why she wants to take on Maki alone to prove her worth as a Jujutsu Sorcerer, to which Maki tells her that she won't hold back.
   As Maki takes on Miwa, Miwa notices that Maki is stronger then what she was led to believe by Maki's twin sister Mai.
   With Miwa struggling to counter Maki's assault, Maki easily distracts Miwa and manages to get close to Miwa and throws her off, while also taking her sword. Maki then leaves while taking Miwa's sword with her.

   Maki encounters her sister Mai, and the two start to fight.
   Maki easily counters all of Mai's shots and closes the distance between the two.
   Once Mai fires all six shots from her revolver, Maki charges at Mai. Maki plans to make sure that Mai can't reload, but is shocked when Mai fires a seventh shot. Maki manages to catch the bullet with her bare hand and disarm Mai. A defeated Mai asks why Maki left their home, and Maki says that she already knows. Mai explains how she would be fine with serving the Zenin clan as a servant if Maki was with her, to which Maki replies that she would have hated herself if she did that. Maki then apologizes to Mai and leaves.

   . He asks what she's going to do. Maki retorts that she's surprised Naoya can recognize women by their faces, because she thought he only looked at their butts. Naoya tells her to answer his question. He says no one will look in her direction anymore, since she can't see curses, can't use cursed techniques and her face, the only good thing about her, is now ruined by burns.
   He then asks her if he should bully her like he used to in the past. He asks her what she's going to do again, but Maki leaves and ignores him.

   On her way to the warehouse, Maki encounters her mother who tells her she must not enter. Maki then shows her the keys to the warehouse and says the head of the clan,

   , gave her permission. A flashback shows Maki and Megumi discussing whether Megumi should be the head of the Zenin clan. Megumi doesn't want to do it, but Maki insists. She tells him that they will gain money, cursed tools, and information if he's head of the clan and it will help them operate differently. When Megumi asks Maki to do it, she gets annoyed and tells him that no one would accept her. Unlike her, Megumi has an inherited technique, a domain expansion, and Satoru Gojo's favor. She adds that even becoming clan head wouldn't be able to make Mai feel like she belongs.
   This makes Megumi understand, and he accepts the position.

   As Maki continues down the hallway her mother calls out to her and tells her to stop. When Maki ignores her, her mother tells her that she wishes Maki would make her proud of giving birth to her at least once. When Maki enters the warehouse she is greeted by her father

   After a brief exchange of blows, Maki breaks Ogi's katana. Though to be defenseless, Maki attempts to deliver another blow. However, unknown to her, Ogi had recreated his blade with curse and slashed her flank. Maki was confused, seeing that she had broke his sword. Ogi closes by stating that he wasn't family head because his children are worthless.

   Ogi drags both of his beaten up daughters to the training room full of cursed spirits and throws them in. He mocks Heavenly Restriction saying that sorcerers train daily to reinforce their bodies with curse energy and that Maki's strength is nothing special. He walks out of the room, calling him a stain on his life.
   Mai feels that Maki still has a heartbeat, seeing she's tough as usual. She suspected that this day would come.

   Maki wakes up to a beach. Mai, sitting besides, her says that she should know how her curse technique works. Since she's heavily wounded, once she makes another object, she'll die. She walks into the ocean wishing her good luck and Maki interjects., calling her to come back. Mai says she knew that twins are auspicious for sorcerers. In order to gain something, one must sacrifice something, which is something other than a

   . In the same way, suffering make them stronger. This rule doesn't always apply to twins. Curse techniques treat twins as "one".
   Even with all of Maki's training, she won't fully develop since Mai doesn't strive to get stronger and has a curse technique while the former does not. Maki rushes towards her, saying she understand and asks her to come back. Mai says that she'll leave "this" and to "throw the rest away". Maki takes that item from her hand and Mai tells her to promise her one thing: destroy everything. Maki and Mai appear as their younger selves and then it return to the present where Maki is holding a sword in her hand.
   Mai lies unresponsive to Maki's pleas to awaken as the horde of curse spirits begin to charge toward them.

   Ogi feels a strange sensation emerging from the training room. He turns around and notices that all the curse spirits have vanished. He sees Maki and Mai at the doorway. He then feels an old sensation that he tried to forget: the fear of

   which traps Maki inside of a frame, Naoya then quickly kicks Maki away and continues his assault.
   Maki is left unable to attack due to Naoya's continuous assault, she thinks to herself how she's in a bad position due to Projection Sorcery's technique which ignores the law of physics and trajectories.
   Maki prepares to use Shiranuigata. She tells Naoya to let her embrace him, however, Naoya moves away and manages to slap Maki's arm.
   Much to Naoya's surprise, Maki turns around and punches him, telling him that he makes 24 moves per second. Naoya attempts to say something but he's interrupted by Maki slamming her fist on his face which leaves him injured and bleeding on the ground. Maki apologizes and asks him what he was trying to say.
