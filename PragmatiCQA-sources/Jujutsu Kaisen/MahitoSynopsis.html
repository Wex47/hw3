As Mahito is shocked by this, Kokichi takes this chance to slam Mahito into the ground. After Mahito lands on the ground, he notices that his soul was destroyed along with his arm. Kokichi starts to rapidly pound the ground, but Mahito manages to slip away. As he flies away, Mahito manages to reshape his soul to create a makeshift arm. As Kokichi launches his

   technique, Mahito manages to slip past the technique. While dodging the attack, Mahito thinks about how he has to figure out which of Kokichi's attacks have an effect on his soul. When Kokichi attack again, Mahito dodges it but Kokichi manages to land a blow. As Kokichi prepares to launch another technique, Mahito manages to trap Kokichi within his territorial expansion.

   Mahito then announces that he has won, and uses his Idle Mutation on Kokichi. As Mechamaru falls to the ground, Mahito gloats about how he was won and turns around to leave. Suddenly Mahito is pierced by Mechamaru, and his body explodes when Kokichi uses a technique on it. As Mahito's territorial expansion is dispelled, Kokichi turns his attention to Geto and prepares to fight. Suddenly Mahito breaks into Mechamaru's cockpit and attacks Kokichi. After the fight is finished, Mahito and Geto leave. As they leave, Mahito and Geto talk about the fight and how they were able to test the screen for their objective.

   Sometime later, Mahito is playing mahjong with Hanami, Jogo, and Geto, during which Geto explains how the

   On October 31, Mahito created multiple transfigured humans and put them in the curtain at Meiji-jingumae Station. Mahito is at the Tokyo Station when he senses that the curtain he has created, has been raised. Mahito figures that a strong sorcerer had done it and wants to fight them, but has work to do. Mahito then mutates all the humans and takes them to Shibuya by train. Once they arrive at Shibuya, Mahito greets Jogo while the mutated humans attack the other humans present. Mahito comments about how the air smell great since it is full of fear. Mahito comments about how they should keep some humans alive and hunt them in a forest, to which Jogo says that he will just burn the forest down. Mahito says that Hanami will get mad, but Jogo says that Hanami is dead much to Mahito's surprise.

   As the mutated humans start to attack the humans, Mahito goes to attack Gojo but notices that he can't hit him. As Gojo attacks Mahito, more humans are fall down into the subway from above, Mahito and Choso use a technique to attack Gojo but all it does is kill the humans that are around Gojo. As all their attacks fail, Mahito thinks about how Gojo is different from Yuji. Mahito is shocked when Gojo activates his Domain Expansion. Mahito is then stunned after Gojo activates his Domain Expansion for less then a second. Leaving all the curses and transfigured humans stunned for several minutes.

   After Mahito recovers he sees that Gojo is being sealed by Geto. When Geto's arm takes control again, he tells Mahito that memories must exist inside the body as well as the soul. Mahito replies that this might be a unique case and would not apply to his own cursed technique, which Geto enjoys as their techniques dictate this world. Mahito then watches as Gojo is sealed inside of the Prison Realm. Mahito asks if they can use the object again, to which Geto replies that the Prison Realm can only have one occupant. When Choso and Jogo get over being stunned, Mahito watches as the Prison Realm forces its way to the ground. Geto explains how the Prison Realm is processing Gojo and is can't be moved, only for them to realize Kokichi was spying on them. After Yuji shouts about what has happened to Gojo, the group debate about what to do. When Jogo is angered by Choso's desire to kill Yuji, Mahito explains to everyone that they don't need Sukuna anymore since they have sealed Gojo. As Jogo continues to say that they still need Sukuna awakened for their plans, Mahito says that he doesn't want to fight Jogo and then propose were the first to find Yuji can decide what to do with him. As Choso agrees to this, Mahito asks what the impostor Geto plans to do. The impostor says that he will stay and watch the Prison Realm. Mahito silently reacts to imposter Geto's words, implying that he may be skeptical of the response he was given. As Jogo says that they should stay at the station more sorcerers are heading to their location, but Mahito and the other spirits leave the station to find Yuji while Jogo is talking. Once the others leave, Mahito splits himself into two and both leave after Dagon eat the humans in their way. Jogo tries to chase after him but Mahito blocks his way. He would also split himself into two parts.

   Later the real Mahito would watch as a wounded Nanami walks by while hiding in a photo booth. After Nanami deals with some mutated humans, Mahito places his hand on Nanami's chest and the two have a small chat. When Yuji suddenly arrives, Mahito kills Nanami and turns his attention to Yuji. As Yuji charges, Mahito distracts Yuji's attention and gets behind him. Mahito attacks with his Body Repel attack, which Yuji manages to stop. Suddenly Mahito appears from the attack and lands a blow on Yuji. Yuji asks why Mahito can kill so easily, to which Mahito replies that Yuji is Mahito. Mahito also says that Yuji wouldn't be able to defeat him until he accepts that. Yuji says that he will make those Mahito's last words, and takes a stance. Mahito thinks about how he has to manipulate himself to be tougher since his other tactics won't work. Mahito takes a stance and starts to inch forward, while planning to pierce Yuji's heart. Mahito manages to get close enough and attacks, but Yuji dodges and lands a kick on Mahito. Mahito recollects himself and compliments Yuji, but also says that they will now begin round two. Mahito then takes a more tactical approach and starts attacking from a distance while running away. Mahito manages to escape Yuji's sight and hide within a human, and manages to land a blow on Yuji when he lets his guard down. Mahito then uses another human to create a sword, and thinks about how he is going to break Yuji's mind.

While the clone is unable to use the original's cursed technique, it is initially unimpressed by Nobara's ability. Initially it seems that Mahito has the upper hand, only to be shocked when Nobara's

Mahito's vulnerability allows Yuji to launch a rush of punishing blows. To deal with this crisis, both Mahitos flee from the battle and force their enemies to follow. The two Mahitos run past each other in the Subway hallway, trapped between Nobara and Yuji. The double rushes towards Yuji while the original touches a confused Nobara. Yuji kills the duplicate only to see Mahito transfigure Nobara's face, blasting it open and destroying one of her eyes

As their fight continues Mahito realizes that he needs to experience Black Flash again in order to truly understand the nature of his own soul. In his haste he attacks Todo only for him to switch places with a revived and focused Yuji. Yuji hits Mahito with his own Black Flash and knocks him away, preparing to fight him alongside Todo. Deciding that Todo is the main problem, Mahito plans on killing him first. Todo manages to trigger his own Black Flash but Mahito blocks it and is completely unharmed because his soul wasn't affected. Using

This last resort attack causes him to appear before Sukuna where Mahito tells the King of Curses to stand aside as he kills Yuji. The attack forces Todo to sever his left hand before the transfiguration spreads only for Mahito to trigger another Black Flash attack, as his abilities were temporarily depleted following his expansion. Todo shocks Mahito by slapping Mahito's hand with his remaining right as a substitute for clapping, triggering

   With his new form, Mahito decides that killing Yuji will mark the start of his true life. His overwhelming power and impenetrable skin place Mahito on an entirely new level. As he is hammered through the ground, Yuji decides that his only chance is to use all his remaining strength in one attack enhanced by a third Black Flash. Mahito pauses, briefly coughing up blood, the damage of Yuji's previous Black Flash punch still lingering. The pair once again get in range, gambling everything on one final attack. Mahito creates an opening in his defenses to bait Yuji's attack, only to be taken by surprise when Yuji uses

Yuji deals a crushing blow to Mahito's side, knocking him out of his Distorted Killing form. A terrified and desperate Mahito tries vomit up more of his transfigured humans only to find that he has run out. The curse listens as Yuji looks down on him and promises to kill him. No matter how much time passes or how many times they are reborn, Yuji promises to kill Mahito again and again with no need to justify his actions as anything but his nature. Mahito turns to run from his mortal enemy, stumbling and falling as Pseudo-Geto arrives and asks Mahito if he wants to be saved. Pseudo-Geto effortlessly beats Yuji with a barrage of curses but Mahito lashes out at his ally. Mahito tells Pseudo-Geto he always knew what Pseudo-Geto's plan for him was, moments before Pseudo-Geto uses his vessel's
