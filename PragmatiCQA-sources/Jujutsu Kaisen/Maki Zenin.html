   . This has left a great deal of her body covered in scars from the severe burns, running all the way up and down both her arms and the sides of her face. The burns likely played a factor in Maki cutting her hair much shorter as well, as it now only reaches just past her ears.

   Maki decided to alter her uniform to keep her arms mostly uncovered. She wore a sleeveless, turtle-neck, black shirt underneath a large cape attached by two Jujutsu High pins on each side. The shirt tucked into a large brown belt with a gold buckle, tied around the waste of tight black pants. The glasses she paired with this outfit were circular but Maki's left eye was covered in bandages from the burns.

   are everything, but Maki couldn't even see curses. Women in sorcerer clans have to stand out even more, leading Maki to be constantly severely mistreated and abused by the Zenin clan. Despite feeling cursed by her own blood, Maki motivates herself to become a strong sorcerer regardless of what her family thinks. She wants to break apart the foundation of their way of their life and reject it completely.
  </p>
  <p key="be514e39-159f-40ee-a65f-92efde14ee7a">
   Maki can come off as rather cold at times, even to her classmates. She is the leader type but Maki is very tough on others and tends to be impatient and hot-tempered. Maki doesn't seem to respect Satoru Gojo as a person due to his very goofy attitude. Even as her teacher and senior, Maki often refers to him as a moron. She was initially very mean to

   While working on a mission together, Maki and Yuta learned to understand one another and she realized they weren't so different. She asked Yuta why he enrolled in the school and he told her that he wanted it to be acceptable for him to live. Maki told him that's what Jujutsu High is all about and encouraged him to use his curse to save people.
  </p>
  <p key="55e2177d-ee0b-42fa-a76d-7884e2189975">
   Maki trained Yuta harshly because she wants to see him get stronger and fight beside her. Something she would later impart on to Megumi and Nobara as their senpai. She's taught them all highly advanced situational awareness and how to properly wield a variety of weapons, even if they had to get beaten up a lot in the process.
  </p>
  <p key="0d4f7adb-80d2-4ce7-aa22-b6295a81a16b">
   Maki has repressed many of her emotions to maintain her trademark tough exterior. She hasn't expressed romantic interest in anyone and

   , Maki and Yuta talked about why Geto referred to her as the "failure of the Zenin clan". Maki initially played it off as if being born a non-sorcerer gave her a perfect excuse to leave because she hated the clan for a variety of other reasons. When Yuta inquired as to why Maki chooses to be a sorcerer and Maki said it's because she's got a bad personality and wants to be a grade 1 sorcerer to spite the Zenin clan.
  </p>
  <p key="a43be691-4540-4dfb-ab51-ee33b094596a">
   Yuta admires Maki's strength and revealed he wants to be like her, strong and resilient. Yuta awkwardly offered to help her stick it to the Zenin clan but called him an idiot and said it was something she needed to do alone. She had spent so long rejecting the need to feel accepted that she became flustered that Yuta kindly recognized her strength. Maki left the conversation to gain her composure and then reminded herself that she should go feeling like she's been recognized.

   As a second-year student, Maki carries an aura of leadership and guides her juniors appropriately. She gravitates toward Megumi because he's also an ex-member of the Zenin clan and they get along well. She's comfortable with teasing him even if it's harsh and this can make her come off as a "cold-hearted demon" at times. When she found Megumi sulking with

  </p>
  <p key="dd564052-7f44-47a5-b009-5fd6c6996f89">
   Maki is someone with a chip on her shoulder and is always determined to prove herself. For the

   , she needed strong teammates to help showcase her abilities on a public stage where she couldn't be denied. She encouraged Megumi and Nobara to get stronger for their fallen ally and figured it was the perfect opportunity to put her juniors in their place.
  </p>
  <p key="152afd9e-c607-4542-94a2-f2a2aece4170">
   Maki doesn't appear to be concerned with the moral aspects of being a sorcerer and is more focused on personal goals. While training, Megumi asked Maki what kind of people she wanted to save as a sorcerer but she doesn't think about that kind of stuff. This clearly annoyed Megumi which in turn angered Maki. She decided to compromise and told Megumi they could talk about it if he improved his skills in hand-to-hand combat enough to challenge her.
  </p>
  <p key="7ebeae4a-7abb-4e8b-8608-157164864a56">
   As a child, Maki promised her twin sister Mai that she would stay with her forever. However, as Maki grew older she realized she couldn't live under the thumb of the oppressive family while Mai was content with doing so. Leaving Mai behind led the only person Maki cared about in the clan to resent her as well. Mai was punished for Maki leaving by getting pressured into becoming a sorcerer even though she wanted to live a normal life. She grew to hate Maki by the time they were both in Jujutsu High.
  </p>
  <p key="c20c12db-ae22-4b8b-9f2b-4418f2b25f31">
   Mai treated Maki as if she was worthless because she lacked significant cursed energy. This is the same type of ridicule most of the Zenin clan threw at Maki all her life, so it didn't appear to bother Maki all that much. In the stance where Mai and Nobara got in a fight, Maki told her twin that they were both worthless because Mai isn't that talented herself, only able to charge weapons with cursed energy.
  </p>
  <p key="262517a7-7ec2-412a-a88a-ab500fde0941">
   This revelation surprised Nobara, who asked the same question Yuta did, why would Maki want to become a sorcerer. Maki simply told her that she wanted to prove her family wrong by becoming a great sorcerer. Nobara expressed her profound respect but Maki didn't make a big deal out of it.
   During the planning phase of the Goodwill Event, Maki overheard Nobara telling

   </a>
   about her circumstances and how they have to win to prove the Zenin clan wrong. At the time, it annoyed her, but only because Maki doesn't want the others to worry about her. Recalling her classmate's acknowledgment of her ability, later on, made Maki smile.
  </p>
  <p key="66bc68d4-40e8-47db-9fda-527b8c2ee5d8">
   Maki didn't actively try to repair her relationship with Mai and engaged in their sibling rivalry to a degree. After defeating Mai, Maki is asked to explain why she didn't stay at the bottom and fall down the hole with her sister. This saddened Maki, who replied that she would've hated herself and apologized to Mai for leaving. Maki walked away without a clear resolution and continued the event, leaving their relationship still fractured.
  </p>
  <p key="00536034-c31c-40a3-ab5a-7e8c2b93d0d4">
   In spite of their troubled past, Maki was able to operate cordially on missions with other members of the Zenin clan. She shared a squad with the head of the clan during the Shibuya Incident. Naobito Zenin was acting very lazy in Shibuya so Maki took over the leadership role to help guide Nobara and Akari. She would tell them to ignore him whenever he would ask for anything off mission.
  </p>
  <p key="15877d84-1582-4ae5-90fa-4382efce15bb">
   Maki and Naobito eventually split off and met up with

   , and were quick to stir up tension with each other. Naobito mentioned that he wouldn't mind if Satoru stay sealed and Maki told him to leave Shibuya if he wasn't going to be any help. Naobito argued that Maki should be the one to leave and Nanami agreed that the fighting in Shibuya had escalated to a degree far too dangerous for her. She ignored this and claimed she'd be more help than a drunk like Naobito, causing Nanami to become more annoyed with him for drinking on the job.
  </p>
  <p key="d62d5ed2-685f-43a8-83b1-8fcedd14b9ca">
   However, this was before Maki ever saw Naobito's capabilities as a sorcerer. She and Nanami were taken back by Naobito's speed and Maki even begrudgingly admitted that Naobito saved her life against

   Maki was severely scarred and injured as a result of the fighting in Shibuya, but she's not the type to ever make a big deal out of it. Yuta reunited with her after some time and expressed his concern but Maki claimed she was fine. When Yuki acknowledged what happened and commended Maki's toughness, Maki simply replied that it was not like she was going for it.

   With Naobito's death, Megumi became head of the Zenin clan due to a special clause. Megumi didn't want to accept the position but Maki implored him to do it. She tried to convince him of all the luxuries that came with being clan, but typical Megumi refused and asked her to do it instead. Irritated, Maki told him no one would accept her and started yelling, listing off all the reasons Megumi would make a decent head before adding barely at the end. Megumi refused still and argued acceptance wouldn't matter but Maki wasn't just good enough to them, but good enough for herself either. Maki believed she still wasn't able to make the clan somewhere Mai could feel she belonged.
  </p>
  <p key="5744c34f-ae69-41d3-aa81-d065115147d0">
   Maki returned to the Zenin clan to collect cursed tools with the clan head's permission but was still harassed on her way there. She ignored both Naoya and her mother's harsh words and pressed on to the vault. Maki's own father conspired against her, attempting to execute Megumi along with the twins. Maki fought against him bravely and tried to save Mai, but was defeated and gravely injured, leaving Maki to be the one saved by Mai.

  <p key="3e122031-fa74-4f34-82d4-87e2da3ab5af">
   Inside a dream-like space, Mai explained that she was going to sacrifice herself while distancing herself from Maki. During that conversation, Maki listened to Mai's explanation but she was constantly trying to close that distance. She didn't want to let go of Mai, before they ever truly got a chance to reconcile, but was forced to accept this was the end. In exchange for Mai giving everything to ensure Maki reached her potential, Maki promised to destroy everything. Maki was devastated by her sister's death but had no time to mourn and had to carry out Mai's request immediately, killing their father in cold blood. Immediately after, Maki was ready to continue and looked to the last thing her sister left for her, a sword. With a cold and remorseless disposition, Maki looked to the sword and told Mai "

   : Maki's grade 4 ranking is not at all reflective of her actual skill level. She was born a non-sorcerer but she has always had tremendous physical abilities, gifted through heavenly restriction in exchange for her severely low cursed energy. By mastering the use of weapons and studying curses at Jujutsu High, she has become a jujutsu sorcerer nonetheless.
  </p>
  <p key="495c9359-9a1b-416d-b995-1efb5bc4ffd1">
   Satoru Gojo and Mei Mei both casually agreed that as a second-year students, there was no good reason Maki wasn't ranked at least grade 2. Maki's tension with the Zenin clan caused them to stall their promotion even though she can exorcise a grade 2 cursed spirit with ease.

Kasumi realized Mai was dead wrong about calling Maki a weakling and believed she'd exorcise a grade 2 curse with ease.

   Fighting against her father, Maki was able to overwhelm her opponent in a sword duel, but Ogi ultimately cut her down using jujutsu.
   As Mai explained, Maki was never able to reach her full potential because what little cursed energy she had was only holding her back. Twins are treated as the same person in jujutsu and Mai was the one born with the innate cursed technique. In exchange for sacrificing her life and taking all the cursed energy between them with her, Mai was able to free Maki from cursed energy and grant her a body of steel.

   Maki's heavenly restricted body was immensely improved, to the point where her strength is comparable to Toji Fushiguro. She effortlessly killed her father in an instant and then went on to annihilate all of the clan's strongest fighters. Maki slaughtered every member of the Kukuru Unit when they had her completely surrounded. Then the Hei immediately ambushed her with all their cursed techniques only for Maki to destroy all of them with a single cursed tool.

   Even Naoya, who inherited Naobito's cursed technique and refused to accept Maki could be Toji's successor in strength, was bested by her new power. Maki has surpassed Naobito, who once saved her.

   Maki's proficiency with weapons is also shown in her ability to teach others to use them. She helped give Yuta a strong base for close combat by training him to use a katana. He became a decent sparring partner after three months and he eventually blossomed into a talented swordsman.
   Maki is also responsible for teaching Megumi how to fight in close quarters. He was extremely lacking at the beginning of his first year at Jujutsu High but she has shown him how valuable close-quarters combat is. She helped him realize he could keep weapons in his shadow and motivated him to learn how to fight with a variety of different types of weapons.

   In the Goodwill Event, Kasumi was surprised that Maki could wield a wide polearm in the middle of a forest where their duel was surrounded by trees.

     Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant
    </b>
   </a>
   : Maki is well trained in several forms of close-quarters combat and generally uses hand-to-hand in tandem with her weaponry. While her hands are generally occupied fighting with weapons, Maki likes to throw kicks at the same time. While fighting Mai, Maki sliced apart her foothold with a katana then delivered a devastating kick to her sister's body that tossed her through the air.
  </p>
  <p key="d5b2bb98-46cd-48b5-8206-618522381e65">
   Unlike Yuji, Maki generally didn't get to showcase her martial arts skills because she requires cursed tools to be a sorcerer. Maki did, however, use hand-to-hand combat to best many members of the Zenin clan with her improved body of steel. Chojuro and Nobuaki were both killed with Maki's bare hands and she defeated Naoya with a single punch after parrying many of his early high-speed attacks.

    High Tactical Intellect
   </b>
   : Maki was raised in one of the major sorcerer clans so she has a solid grasp on the important aspects of the jujutsu world. While generally looking to overpower her opponents with her physical skills, Maki is also a highly intelligent fighter. She has proven leadership skills and gives effective orders within her squad to work together as a unit. As the de-facto leader of the Tokyo Team in the Goodwill Event, Maki came up with the strategy to counter

   's one-track mind and brute strength.
   She and Megumi were also quick to figure out the Kyoto Team's formation was targeting an assassination on Yuji.
   In Shibuya, it was her plan for Nobara and Akari to leave the barrier and rescue Ijichi.
  </p>
  <p key="5e16f796-22d0-4f97-9ff9-2c9c8ffca60b">
   Against her father, Maki formulated a good plan to win a sword exchange with Ogi. She feigned a single-strike duel and then followed up with more attacks that broke Ogi's katana.
   She defeated Naoya by constantly analyzing his cursed technique and looking for the secret to his speed, which she was eventually able to figure out.

    Immense Strength
   </b>
   : Maki has always possessed extraordinarily high levels of strength for a human. She knocked out Aoi Todo with a baseball to the face and broke a wooden polearm over her thigh, something no normal person is physically capable of. As a testament to her heavenly gifted strength, Playful Cloud is a cursed tool that relies solely on its user's power. She was able to use it to damage to powerful special grade cursed spirits on her own.
  </p>
  <p key="53f2bda0-c052-4fe1-8224-b5797c63459e">
   As with all of her physical abilities, Maki's strength grew tremendously after her cursed energy was completely taken away. It is more than enough to fight back against cursed techniques. Maki easily broke free from the stone hands attack that
   <a href="Chojuro Zenin.html" key="fc5e08a0-05cb-4dbc-b32f-56d398080f68" title="Chojuro Zenin">

   </a>
   hit her with and broke free from Ranta's paralysis using brute strength and willpower.
   Compounded with the speed Naoya was approaching her at, the brute strength in Maki's left hand crippled the right side of her opponent's face to end their fight.

    Immense Agility &amp; Reflexes
   </b>
   : Maki has incredible speed to match her strength and moves well enough in a fight for her agility to be acknowledged by Hanami.
   She makes sharp moves, and stays highly mobile in a fight with great precision. Against Mai's revolver, Maki effortlessly dodged and weaved through her sister's barrage of bullets. Not only did she slice a bullet in half with a katana, Maki even moved fast enough to catch a speeding bullet just a few centimeters from her face using incredibly astute reflexes.
  </p>
  <p key="58b1b8a4-4dc9-4da9-988e-334d85b97682">
   After escaping from cursed energy, Maki's body could move and react fast enough to compete with Naoya's Projection Sorcery, which allowed him to break subsonic speed.
   She killed Chojuro and Nobuaki before either of them even knew what happened. In their last moments, both noted how Maki's speed had grown so much she had become unrecognizable.

    Immense Endurance
   </b>
   : Although she never had an effective resistance to curses, Maki has always been tough. Her inborn physical toughness saved her life when she was burned point blank by Jogo's cursed technique. No amount of curse tolerance saved Naobito from similar injuries.
  </p>
  <p key="945c5f78-0bea-4391-8bdf-4e77ac3bbae9">
   While Maki was very durable, she was eventually sliced open and incapacitated by her father. Maki's improved body of steel healed her injuries and came with highly improved durability that overpowered the Zenin clan's cursed techniques with pure physical prowess. Maki suffered a direct hit from Chojuro's giant stone hands smashing together, something Nobuaki believed should've completely immobilized her, and broke out of the stone just a few moments later.

      </b>
      : Maki originally possessed very low levels of cursed energy, even less than the average non-sorcerer. She couldn't see curses without glasses imbued with cursed energy, the most basic requirement to be considered a sorcerer. This was despite Maki being born into a powerful sorcerer clan, due to being born a twin, which are auspicious for sorcerers. Treated as one person in jujutsu, Mai had the cursed technique and most of the cursed energy between them. With Mai's sacrifice, she took all the cursed energy between them, making Maki only the second known person to have escaped cursed energy completely after Toji.

        While Mai was born with more cursed energy and the cursed technique between the twins, Maki was born with extraordinary physical capabilities that would eventually grow into peak human combat prowess. Her talents at this stage where comparable to sorcerers who constantly train and imbue their flesh with cursed energy to improve their abilities. This is what allowed Maki to work as a jujutsu sorcerer despite not having enough cursed energy to be technically be considered one.
       </p>
       <p key="5e044529-9c54-4126-bd5b-0c1393e57894">
        This little amount of cursed energy was actually holding Maki back. By escaping from it, Maki was granted a body of steel with physical prowess similar to the immensely powerful likes of Toji. Her strength and speed improved beyond superhuman levels, making her capable of eliminating the entire Zenin clan with ease. She could even track and keep up with the 24FPS rule of Projection Sorcery, which requires the user and anyone they touch to trace up to twenty-four of their next movements in a single second.
