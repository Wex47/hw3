When more humans are thrown down to the scene of conflict, Choso kills some of the humans with his technique, distracting Gojo. Gojo responds by activating his domain expansion for less than a second, greatly stunning Choso with his flawless technique.

   Later Choso encounters Yuji and attacks him. When Yuji gets close enough to land a punch, Choso defends himself but notices that Yuji's punch had made a double impact.

Choso tries to attack with his blood but finds out that the water is making it harder for him to manipulate the blood that is outside of his body. Choso decides to use Flowing Red Scale: Stack to increase his body's capabilities to a maximum and fights Yuji in hand to hand combat. Choso continues the fight, and manages to withstand the blows that Yuji throws at him. Choso manages to land a blow that knocks Yuji out and is about to finish Yuji off, but stops when a memory appears in his head. Choso is confused about this memory and leaves the area.

Both Choso and Yuji fight Naoya who's able to parry both of their attacks with ease. Naoya suddenly moves away from the two as Yuji says that he's incredibly quick.

Choso asays that Naoya is who he is because of his brothers, which irritates Naoya. He adds that he's tough because as the older brother, he must walk ahead. Choso starts bleeding profusely which shocks Naoya. Due to the wave of blood, Naoya's sight on Choso has disappeared and Choso is able to move to a different location.

   Yuki objects to this says it isn't fair because they haven't told them why and for how long they need to do it.

When Tengen reveals that the method Kenjaku has chosen is to merge humankind with themselves. Choso asks them how can they merge with multiple people when they're only one individual where Tengen explains what happened 11 years ago. They add on that if humankind evolves and only one person rages out, the world will end. Yuki asks them why who says that the impurities of a hundred million people would flood the world, which what happened to Tokyo would happen to the entire world as well.

On the day of the merging, both the Six Eyes and the Star Plasma Vessel appeared.

   When Megumi asks why the culling game is happening, Tengen explains the culling game uses the participants and the boundaries binding barriers in a ritual that conveys to the human beings of this country to the other side. And with that, Kenjaku will begin the merging with themselves, however, to preform the ritual, he has undertaken certain binding vows. They add on that one stipulates that he isn't the game master and this game doesn't work in their favor because even if Kenjaku is killed, the culling game will continue until all participants are either dead or the players refuse to participate and die. Yuji notices that Megumi is upset by this but is unsure why. Yuta concludes that they have no other choice but to participate and add a rule that allows

   and other unwilling participants to safely get out. Megumi adds that they also should free Gojo sensei because he would be able to settle everything on his own.
   Yuji looks over at Master Tengen and asks for them to tell them but they say to first decide who should remain as guards.

   . Tengen explains that before Kenjaku found the Prison Realm, it was outside of their barrier who believes it was overseas and reveals that by sealing the rear gate, they were hiding the existence of the "front" but it was useless. Yuji asks if it's like a back gate which Tengen confirms it is. Tengen tells them that Gojo is sealed inside of the rear gate as well and that the authority of opening the gate rests with Kenjaku as he is the bearer point of the "front". They add on that to break it open, they will need the

   is, Tengen confirms this and tells them that she is in the colony on the east side of Tokyo. Master Tengen adds on that because the barrier rejects them, they don't have anymore information. They tell them that there are ten colonies around Japan and that they are connected by a barrier that forms a line that sends humans from Japan to the other side. Yuki asks if the reason why Hokkaido isn't included because of the jujutsu society's barriers where Tengen confirms and says that has already been established as a vast sacred area with Yuji commenting on how that's rugged lands. Tengen tells them that conveyance to the other side may sound like an exaggeration but a curse fell on everyone in Japan in preparation of the merger. Megumi asks how long will it take to complete the ritual where they say it will most likely take 2 months.

   Maki says that it's currently 9 a.m. on November 9th, Yuta adds on that the sorcerer players awakened at about midnight on October 31st. Megumi comes to the conclusion that Tsumiki only has 10 days and 15 hours to declare her participation.He then turns to Master Tengen and says that they mentioned those who refuse to participate in the Culling Game will be killed, a statement Tengen confirms. Maki then says how Shoko was correct about the

Yuji wonders about the civilians who are already inside a barrier to which Tengen says that they will be given a chance to exit, much to his surprise. Yuta sarcastically comments on how generous of them.

   Tengen says that there is no rule about entering or exiting colonies and adds on that from the start, players are given a clear objective of exiting the barrier and that they suppose this is for stimulating the game. Tengen tells them that in order to confine the players, the premise that they entered of their free will is important. Yuji thinks about what

   told him about the "increase or decrease" of a barriers effectiveness. Tengen tells them that each player will receive a shikigami that's called a Kogane. Tengen adds that a Kogane is less game master than an interface. They say that they may think of the game master as the Culling Game programmer which confuses Yuji. Yuji says that they're unable to subtract rules that already exist while Megumi says that there are ways to counteract the rules.

   Tengen informs them that the players are subjected to strict rules and sorcery wise, Kenjaku is due to no further bias. Yuji is disappointed that he will be forced to kill people again as Megumi tells him that he has a few ideas.
