As Yuta prepares to join Rika, Rika suddenly returns to her appearance when she was still alive. As they are all confused by this, Gojo shows up and informs them that Rika's curse has now dispelled. Gojo explains how it was Yuta that had cursed Rika when she died, because he could not accept her death. As Yuta starts to blame himself for everyone that was hurt by Rika, she hugs Yuta and explains how she was truly happy being by Yuta's side for the past 6 years. Rika then bids Yuta goodbye and disappears.
