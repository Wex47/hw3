   Later, Geto is in the classroom with Gojo and Shoko, where they discuss the importance of a curtain. Geto and Gojo then get into an argument about the strong protecting the weak which almost ends with them fighting. Suddenly, Masamichi enters the room and gives Geto and Gojo a mission from

   As they arrive at the location to pick up the vessel for the mission, an explosion happens and the vessel falls to the ground. Before the vessel hits the ground, Gojo helps Geto save the vessel.

   After talking, Gojo and Geto bring Riko to her junior high, since she forced them to, so that she can visit her friend. Once they arrive at the school, Gojo calls Masamichi, who explains how they have to oblige Riko before she fuses with Tengen. After talking with Masamichi, they decide to check the surveillance spirits and Geto tells him that two have been exorcised. Gojo and Misato head out to protect Riko, while Geto deals with the intruders.

   . On the way, Gojo is contacted by Geto, who informs him about the situation. Suddenly the two encounter multiple opponents and Gojo figures out that the opponent is using the clone technique to increase his numbers. Gojo manages to defeat their opponent, but Riko informs him that Misato has been captured by the enemy. Gojo and Rika meet up with Geto and they discuss what to do next. They decide to save Misato and head to Okinawa for the meeting spot with the kidnappers. They manage to save Misato and decide to have some fun before heading back. When it's time head back to the college, Riko manages to convince them to stay for one more day. Geto asks Gojo if he is alright since Gojo has been using his technique for a while, but Gojo says that he is fine and they continue to have fun. The next day, the four head back to the college but are attacked when they arrive.

   Gojo tells the others to head inside, while he takes care of the enemy. Gojo fights the enemy but notices that he can't read his opponent's moves, because the enemy has no cursed energy. When he loses trace of the enemy, Gojo decides to sweep the field with one of his techniques. After sweeping the field, Gojo figures that his opponent won't be able to sneak up on him but the enemy manages to block Gojo's vision with multiple cursed spirits.

   Gojo wonders what to do, but the enemy attacks and manages to wound Gojo. Gojo manages to recover and head off to the Star Religious group's base to retrieve Riko's body. Once there, he confronts the enemy and explains how he managed to survive. Gojo then takes on the enemy and after a couple of exchanges, manages to kill him with his purple technique. Gojo then heads inside of the Star Religious group's base and manages to retrieve Riko's body. When Geto shows up, Gojo suggests that they take care of everyone there, but Geto tells him that there is no reason to do so since their group will be disbanded soon enough.

   A year later, Geto and Shoko are helping Gojo with his techniques. Gojo explains how he is able to continuously use his technique without causing harm to himself. Days later, Gojo is informed that Geto is on the run after having massacred an entire village along with killing his own parents. Gojo is contacted by Shoko who tells him that Geto is in Shinjuku. Gojo heads over to Shinjuku and manages to confront Geto. The two then talk about how Geto plans to kill every non-shaman in world. When Geto starts to walk away, Gojo thinks about how he can't bring himself to kill Geto. Gojo meets with Masamichi and the two talk about how strong he is after that.

When Megumi says that he doesn't care about his dad anymore since he hasn't been around for a while, Gojo tells Megumi to just ask him if he wants to know anything about his dad. Gojo then asks if he wants to go to the Zenin family, to which Megumi says that his answer will depend if his sister will be happy if they go. Gojo tells Megumi that his sister would not be happy, and that he will take care of things and that Megumi should focus on getting strong from now on.

    Prison Realm
   </a>
   . Before being sealed, Gojo asks Geto how long he plans to let someone else take control of his body, when Geto's arm suddenly grabs his own neck. The imposter laughs and comments on how that this was the first time an inhabited body disobeyed him. The grip is not tight, and the impostor calls Mahito over and the two continue a philosophical discussion on what came first, the body or soul. After listening to the two ramble, Gojo tells the impostor to just seal him away already, since he is tired of listening to them. The impostor then seals Gojo in the Prison Gate's boundary.

   Geto is holding the cube when it begins to shake and then plummets to the ground by an unforeseen force, shattering the floor on impact. Due to Gojo's massive amount of power, the Prison Realm is having a hard time processing his power and Gojo was able to use his technique to force the Prison Gate's Boundary to the ground much to the annoyance of the impostor. Inside of the seal, Gojo comments about how he had messed up but reassures himself that everything will be fine and that he still has faith in everyone.

   After the events of the Shibuya Incident, Gojo has been deemed an accomplice and is permanently exiled from the jujutsu society. Removing his seal is now considered as a criminal act, and anyone who does remove the seal will be considered a traitor.
