   For casual attire, Toji wears a simple outfit consisting of a long sleeved shirt and matching pants with sandals. While fighting, Toji wears a tight fitting short sleeve shirt and sports tan baggy training pants with a black belt weaved through the waist, as well as black martial arts slippers. While still a member of the Zenin family, Toji wore a dark colored

  </h2>
  <p key="b686a10d-39d9-4953-9d7c-a2f760722009">
   Toji is a cold, calm, confident type of man who likes to enjoy himself and make money using his skills. He appears to enjoy insightful conversation with others as long as it somehow pertains to himself
   and can trade witty banter with the highly sarcastic likes of Satoru Gojo. Upon meeting, Satoru asked Toji if they had met before but Toji assured him that he's not the type to remember some guy either.
   In battle, Toji has a crazed expression as if he's lost in the thrill of the fight, but he's always maintaining a cool and calculated head and plotting his next move.
  </p>
  <p key="6fd6b31d-eb1e-4e82-a811-a2c3b73ce766">
   Toji is an assassin who's garnered the name "Sorcerer Killer" and spends his time gambling between assignments from shady clients.
   He married a woman and left her just as quickly
   , leaving his newborn child behind without knowing their gender
   and eventually forgot their name.
   Toji even planned on selling Megumi to the Zenin family he had left behind, exploiting the young Megumi for the cursed technique he would eventually inherit.
  </p>
  <p key="f77e4523-a2ab-4784-8801-bd6c4663007e">
   Toji doesn't question his clients motives as long as the money is right and generally doesn't do any extra work for free. He's bold and dangerously calculated in his strategies, using his jujutsu knowledge to outwit even the most prophesized sorcerers. This garnered him a reputation large enough to gain attention from the wealthy Time Vessel Association for such an important job that could ensure their future. While he thought the religious members of the organization were crazy, he got along well enough with their middle man to invite him to eat.
  </p>
  <p key="2bc1e7a9-7353-4ddf-9530-031fef8ed008">
   As a non-sorcerer raised in the Zenin family who values cursed techniques above all, Toji is a man who has suffered due to the interests of the sorcerer clans in a very similar manner to

    Maki Zenin
   </a>
   . His evil actions are a result of his dejection towards the jujutsu world as he attempts to spite it. Born without cursed energy, Toji eventually left the Zenin family and married a woman, taking her name "Fushiguro".
   He sold their son to the Zenin family because he believed in young Megumi's potential to be a real sorcerer
   , naming him "Megumi" because it means blessings.
  </p>
  <p key="8b7c5890-4d32-4695-bdc0-74f62b4b45b4">
   Toji was able to complete his final mission for the Time Vessel Association and should have cut and run when faced with a rejuvenated Satoru Gojo. However, due to his disdain for the jujutsu world and the sorcerer families, Toji chose to try and cut down the most gifted sorcerer in the world as another way to spite them all. Unfortunately, this pride cost Toji his life. Unable to look past his demons, he deviated from his natural instincts and ignored the uneasiness plaguing him during the fight.
  </p>
  <p key="a384821a-f22a-409c-a68a-c86aa0e4b985">
   Keeping up with his cold persona, Toji chose not to utter any final words at first. In his last moments he thought of his ex-wife and their son, so he decided to tell Satoru that Megumi would be sold into the Zenin family in a few years.
   This would eventually lead to Satoru becoming a close mentor for Megumi in the future as well as granting Megumi a chance to work as a jujutsu sorcerer.

   returned Toji's soul from the dead, turning him into a walking manifestation of carnage. He would attack anything in his path, mostly focused on crushing the strongest opponent available.
   While endangering his own son with this outburst of aggression, Toji chose to return to death by committing suicide in order to protect him. He also did so without ever revealing their connection to each other. Instead, with his final words, Toji expresses that he's glad to hear that Megumi refers to himself as a Fushiguro instead of a Zenin.

    Overall Skill Level
   </b>
   : While Toji is technically a non-curse user with no innate talent for jujutsu, he was one of the most elite fighters in the jujutsu world when he was alive. With innate physical prowess far superior to all others in his path, Toji contended with the most dangerous and highly ranked jujutsu practitioners this era had to offer.
  </p>
  <p key="65d6d43c-7ce8-4479-ae7e-e6ce27671d49">
   He was able to defeat special grade jujutsu users on three separate occasions, one of which was a young Satoru Gojo, who at the time was still considered a prodigy and one of the world's strongest sorcerers.
   The other sorcerer who was considered the strongest at the time was the curse manipulator,

  </p>
  <p key="54f1de81-310d-4497-918b-a7bc84ba09aa">
   Toji used the jujutsu knowledge from the Zenin family and turned it against sorcerers. This earned him the moniker of "Sorcerer Killer". During the Star Plasma Vessel Escort Mission, an assignment given to the two strongest sorcerers by

   , Toji was hired by the Time Vessel Association to assassinate the girl. Toji was able to completely derail the escort through a series of tactical moves over the course of a few days. This wore down the escort team and lured them into a false sense of security before he abruptly made his move.

   , ocular jujutsu that grants god-like perception.
   Toji took full advantage of his lack of cursed energy, making him the perfect assassin thanks to his status as an "invisible man". The culmination of all Toji's talents allowed him to successfully defeat the Star Plasma Vessel's escort team and assassinate the girl
   , completing his assignment while nearly killing both of Jujutsu High's most blessed sorcerers in the process.

  <p key="2b96a12e-0f7a-4cf4-92c3-39d601ad59bf">

   , another special grade sorcerer found that Toji was the only case where a Heavenly Restriction has eradicated someone's cursed energy completely. By eliminating all cursed energy, Toji's body was sharpened to the point where he developed a resistance to curses and was able to detect them with his highly refined five senses. This also allowed him to dominate and utilize a cursed spirit capable of storing his wide arsenal of weapons. Yuki considered him to be truly superhuman and told Suguru that he shouldn't be ashamed to have lost to him in a fight.

  <p key="21755609-8b38-48b7-aa3a-f0deeca1851b">
   When resurrected by Granny Ogami's Séance Technique, Toji's body was able to overwrite her technique and acted purely on fighting instinct. At the start of his out of control rampage, Toji killed Ogami with a single blow
   and nearly beat grade 2 sorcerer,

In comparison, Toji made exorcising Dagon look effortless, cementing his own status to undeniably on the level of that of a special grade.
  </p>
  <p key="8e3fedab-7bc5-4ad2-be30-6a885e31f798">
   Shortly afterward, Toji confronted Megumi, and the latter compared Toji to a fully realized Maki. He also recognized Toji as a "monster" capable of taking out a special grade cursed spirit and assessed his shikigami were no match for him.
   If Toji had not chosen to sacrifice himself, Megumi too would have been another victim of Toji's rampage.

  <p key="b86e3506-7649-4e5d-91a2-346109851cec">
   Toji has used non-cursed tools such as swords to perform a sneak attack so no cursed energy will be detected. Armed with a normal handgun, he's also an expert marksmen with extremely precise aim.

  <p key="5dd16ad8-73d9-4ef5-a1fc-636560da46b0">
   The Sorcerer Killer is able to counter jujutsu users because he is a master of wielding cursed tools as well. He's used a cursed tool broadsword to counter and slice open giant cursed spirits.
   Toji has employed knives and daggers, sometimes one in each hand.
   Additionally he employs his special grade cursed tool: The Inverted Spear of Heaven with a mastery worthy of that ranking. He was able to capitalize on the dagger's powerful nullification technique to negate even the most powerful sorcerer's abilities.

  <p key="ef15b3e6-d967-4f7a-b5d3-6563ac346a82">
   Toji successfully complements his physical gifts with high adaptability and dexterity with all his weapons. By attaching a chain to the Inverted Spear of Heaven, Toji changed his entire fighting style to suit a long ranged battle.
   When he first confronted Dagon, Toji took Playful Cloud, a weapon that Megumi stated was difficult to use, from Maki and used it to its maximum potential.

   : Thanks to his Heavenly Restriction, Toji's lack of cursed energy resulted in his five senses being heightened to their absolute peak. He was able to see curses and jujutsu with just his elevated senses and even developed a resistance to them.
   This also allowed Toji to track sorcerers without the use of residuals, as he was able to follow human footprints and odors.

   Using Playful Cloud, a tool that depends on physical strength, Toji was able to easily smash through Dagon's hardest shikigami.
   With another cursed tool, he was able to cut through Suguru's toughest curse

   Megumi also stated that Toji was ridiculously fast, even faster than Sukuna with two fingers.
   In their fight, Toji was able to avoid a point blank stabbing attack despite getting his foot caught in Megumi's shadow thanks to incredible agility and reflexes.
   He also stated that seeing Toji while he moves is near impossible and was impressed his speed rivaled that of Sukuna's without cursed energy.

  <p key="c73a6d52-9306-494f-8af5-ff331eba65ce">
   Toji's speed was also enough to easily counter Suguru's curses in their exchange. He quickly avoided Suguru's Rainbow Dragon by moving on top of a building despite the swift curse being right in front of him. His reflexes were also quick enough to counter

  <p key="0d389ba9-c765-4015-ae3f-65cb8944e97d">
   Using this information Toji was able to plot out a way to slowly wear down Satoru and his escort team. With connections to the curse user community and funds from the Star Religious Group, Toji put a bounty on the Star Plasma Vessel's head.
   By posting it on a website for curse users with a time limit, evil sorcerers flocked to collect the bounty.
   He knew they'd be unable to win so this was free labor, a smart way to use his resources. The time limit also ended up working in his favor as well, luring Satoru into lowering his guard once the mission was over. Once Satoru deactivated the Infinity, the Sorcerer Killer immediately acted and only then jumped into fight the sorcerer directly.

  <p key="573f6df8-597e-4506-8287-67509a769548">
   Toji is clever in battle and quick to analyze his opponent's abilities. He correctly assumed Suguru's technique early in their battle

       Inventory Curse
      </b>
      : Toji has a cursed spirit that can store a high number of different objects within its body. This allows Toji to store his weapons as well as freely interchange them by putting them into the curse or taking them out of its mouth. Additionally, the curse can shrink itself within its own body, allowing Toji to ingest it so people can't detect the curse energy it emits.
      The inventory curse contains Toji's entire wide arsenal, including his cursed tools and even a swarm of

       Toji and the curse had established a master-servant relationship. Suguru Geto's curse manipulation technique requires him to kill the master before he can absorb the curse. Suguru attempted to absorb the curse to cut off Toji's weapons cache, but the curse rejected him per the rules of his technique since Toji was still alive.

      is a special grade cursed tool that embodies pure and solid power, which he took from Maki Zenin after he was resurrected. In Toji's hands, the three-section staff reflected his incredible physical strength, making a weapon capable of destroying even Dagon's hardest shikigami with a single blow. By rubbing it together, Toji sharpened Playful Cloud, turning it into a deadly stabbing weapon. He used it to stab Dagon repeatedly through the head until the special grade was exorcised.
