   Yuta is a young man of average height with disheveled black hair and dark blue eyes. His body language makes it easy to tell that Yuta is very stressed. His posture is very unconfident, and he has dark eyelids due to lack of sleep.
  </p>
  <p key="29f9a383-c5a8-477c-a9b8-ce0309b02e3d">
   At his old school, Yuta wore a suit for their uniform. He sports a long-sleeve shirt that stops at his forearms or a black t-shirt and dark green pants for casual wear.
  </p>
  <p key="4c8fc728-8a02-487c-b915-9a2c9edf21a1">
   After transferring to Tokyo Jujutsu High, Yuta received a specialized uniform. Yuta has a loose white jacket with sleeves that stop at his forearms. The rest of his uniform appears to be the usual Jujutsu High dark colors. He also often carries his sword on his back.

   haunting much of his early life, Yuta was unable to connect with other people and has lost all confidence in himself. This makes it difficult for Yuta to interact with others, as they often scare him without meaning to, or he's just too shy to speak to them.
  </p>
  <p key="7a6603c5-d018-41d5-980d-d4d0016417ef">
   Even so, Yuta genuinely cared about other people and decided to isolate himself from them even if it means remaining alone.

    Maki Zenin

   called Yuta out for being a moody kid who's lived his entire life without goals.
   He acknowledged that this was true and used her advice to gain a resolve for being a jujutsu sorcerer. This helps Yuta realize that deep down, he truly desires the confidence to feel like he belongs.
  </p>
  <p key="db772869-8d38-4044-bac5-3d834e21422f">
   While his timid nature stays intact, Yuta slowly becomes more social and interacts with others normally. Even after early signs of improvement, Yuta still struggled to understand someone like

   until he realized how kind of a person he truly is and made an effort to establish a social connection.
  </p>
  <p key="dbb6f5fa-8a9b-4b8b-bcfc-2550d19f4a2d">
   Gaining friends helps Yuta gain confidence in himself and establish the goal to help set Rika free. He felt responsible for her turning into a curse in the first place
   and worked extremely hard to find a way to help her. He pushed himself during training and took all his friends' and mentors' words to heart, showing a more determined side of himself.
   At his core, Yuta wants to become someone who can help keep others out of danger.

   </a>
   , Yuta showed the darkest side of himself. Geto hurt Yuta's only friends, and the young man was more than willing to kill him for it.
   Yuta's rage allowed him to even command Rika's power at will. He was willing to sacrifice his life to use Rika to kill Geto to avenge his friends, the only people who give him the confidence to continue living.

   When Yuta returned to Jujutsu High after time away overseas, he was accompanied by a new Rika and it appeared as if he was lost in his darkness. He agreed to kill Gojo's other pupil,

   </a>
   for the higher-ups and claimed it was revenge for cutting off Toge's arm.
   Yuta carried a deathly serious and cold persona who was straight to the point. He attempted to kill Yuji before so much as exchanging words and then apologized while committing the act.
  </p>
  <p key="f6526233-da3b-4099-9a29-9fdc60b0f1fb">
   However, this was all an act to help protect Yuji from the higher-ups. Yuta had to act a certain way to make it believable and he healed Yuji before the first-year died permanently. Even though Yuta has never met Yuji, he went out of his way to deceive authority and help Yuji because Gojo asked him to. Yuji is important to people who are precious to Yuta and that was more than enough reason for him to help. He also sympathizes with Yuji because he was in the exact same situation, up for execution bearing a power he could not hope to contain. Yuta doesn't blame Yuji for

   's actions.
  </p>
  <p key="0056cdaa-8eee-4330-b0a4-34323930a6bd">
   Without the false guise of a cold killer, Yuta is still a naturally friendly person who has developed a lot as a person. He's much more social and is less timid than he used to be. When Gojo visited Yuta in Africa, the outspoken teacher was surprised his student was even telling jokes.
  </p>
  <p key="22d2a6fa-65d4-435f-adcd-f4cb63de5d0f">
   Yuta assimilated comfortably back into interacting with his peers and dedicated himself to helping them. He agreed to help Megumi rescue his sister from the
   Culling Game
   . He also did his diligence as a senpai and agreed to stop Sukuna should he ever take control of Yuji's body again. Upon reuniting with Maki, Yuta was excited to see her and expressed concern about her injuries.
  </p>
  <p key="4d1ea30e-2bd2-44db-b545-53515a29fd3d">

   's barrier had rejected their group, Yuta was concerned and quick to suggest they turn back because Megumi's sister doesn't have time.
   Once Tengen allowed them inside and provided crucial information, Yuta agreed to enter the Culling Game right away by himself. He also suggested they get

   </b>
   : Yuta is one of only four special grade sorcerers recognized by Jujutsu High.
   While being haunted by Rika's vengeful spirit, Yuta was immediately registered as a special grade due to Rika's immense power, making him the most recent person to receive the ranking.

  <p key="97472dab-fb6d-4907-8403-2174938070ec">
   Yuta was completely unaware of how to fight or control his

   when Satoru threw him into his first mission. He relied on Maki until they were swallowed by a curse and it came down to Yuta to rescue everyone inside. Yuta was able to tap into his emotions and fully manifest Rika, ripping the other curse apart and freeing everyone. Yuta barely carried everyone outside the barrier but he used what little physical strength and stamina he had to finish the mission.
  </p>
  <p key="d425433a-d5a7-4a54-9d3d-f86de5a772e0">
   This made Yuta painfully aware of how weak he was, so Maki trained him on the basics of armed combat for three months before his next assignment. He was never able to land a hit on Maki but always trained hard to improve himself and started to move a lot better. However, in his second mission, an exorcism with Toge, Yuta still found himself relying on his classmate's skill. When a semi-grade 1 curse ambushed them, Toge was injured saving Yuta. This time Yuta stepped up on his own without relying on Rika and helped Toge exorcise it. Yuta's training allowed him to avoid most of the cursed spirit's attacks and he even landed a counterattack. It was just a shallow slash, however, due to the toughness of the curse and Yuta's poor cursed energy control at the time.

   Continuing training throughout his tenure at Jujutsu High, Yuta continued to grow stronger and build a solid foundation as a sorcerer. On December 24, 2017, Suguru Geto targeted him in an attempt to take Rika for himself and Satoru sent Toge and Panda to intercept him. Satoru knew that Suguru wouldn't kill Yuta's friends, but that he would injure them enough to set off Yuta. This was exactly the case when Yuta confronted Geto after the curse user hurt Maki, Toge, and Panda. Yuta's emotions exploded and his power along with it, sending extraordinary levels of cursed energy coursing through his body. This resulted in an almighty increase of Yuta's physical abilities and the fine-tuning of his senses.

   Alongside Rika, Yuta was able to match Geto one-on-one. He revealed not only the ability to use the extremely rare reverse cursed technique but the capacity to copy other cursed techniques like

   The major difference in their battle was that Yuta was willing to give his life to win while the cursed manipulator didn't have the vast majority of his curses, with over four thousand serving the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons.

   By March of 2018, only three months after the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons, Yuta regained his rank as a special grade sorcerer. He is a prodigy who boasts incredible power and unusual abilities second only to Satoru Gojo.
   Satoru forced Geto's comrade, Miguel, to train Yuta. Miguel mentored Yuta overseas while they searched for the

a large cursed spirit and then Rika instantly destroyed it without even physically appearing.

Naoya, who especially prides himself on his abilities, was quick to ally himself with Yuta in order to avoid any potential conflict. Choso, another special grade, told Yuji to run away immediately because he could feel Yuta's overwhelming strength is on a scale similar to Satoru Gojo's, ensuring death.

   , Yuji was holding himself back, something Yuta noticed.
   Yuji was able to recognize that Yuta has even more cursed energy than Satoru and his reinforcement techniques are far beyond what an average sorcerer can achieve.
   Yuji could normally steel his own body with cursed energy to reduce damage but Yuta would easily pierce through that. This relegated Yuji to evading for most of the encounter.

  <p key="20879fbf-e73b-4656-8d1d-cc6941f51029">
   Yuji attempted to fight back with his own weapon and Yuta noticed his opponent was overly focused on the katana. Yuta eventually sliced him open but got his katana broken as a result. Rika decided to intervene and this point by partially manifesting, immobilizing Yuji with ease. This allowed Yuta to stop Yuji's heart and perform the "execution"
   , only to revive him with a reverse cursed technique. Yuta has mastered the ability to use a reverse cursed technique and output it as positive energy, something even Satoru can't do.
   When Yuji returned for Naoya, he confronted Choso and knocked out the special grade with one hit.

   Yuta has continued to hone his skill as a swordsman and still wields a katana as his weapon of choice. His skills have improved dramatically and are perfectly balanced with his enhanced cursed energy manipulation, allowing Yuta to wield a blade with superhuman physical prowess. He's fast and makes decisive attacks that Yuji could barely avoid. The blade is constantly surging with cursed energy just like the rest of Yuta's body, giving it superior cutting ability. He defeated a large cursed spirit with a diving stab so powerful it cracked the ground beneath them.

        : Yuta's power comes from his relation to Michizane Sugawara, but it only first manifested when he transformed Rika Orimoto, a loved one, into a cursed spirit. Rika became a vengeful spirit so powerful that Geto, an avid collector of powerful cursed spirits, dubbed her as the "Queen of Curses." Rika's boundless cursed energy could be shaped into any technique, allowing Yuta to use advanced curse techniques within a year of learning about jujutsu.

        Yuta retains the massive amounts of cursed energy that were unraveled from Rika's curse. He likely has the most cursed energy of any human, proclaiming to have even more than Satoru. Overall, Yuta's cursed energy can still be exhausted after prolonged jujutsu usage but this can't happen to Satoru, who can flawlessly manage the energy expenditure with the

        Yuji and Choso could immediately tell from Yuta's presence that his cursed energy was on par with Satoru, with the former claiming it was even more creepy and ominous feeling.

       Advanced Cursed Energy Control

      : In his second year as a sorcerer, Yuta has improved his cursed energy control dramatically. Yuta understands that he carries vast levels of cursed energy and now knows how to apply it accordingly. He has been training his weak body and constantly strengthens in battle with massive amounts of cursed energy. This puts Yuta's reinforcement technique on a level that far surpasses even an elite sorcerer's, making his attacks difficult to predict.

       Not only are Yuta's attacks unpredictable upon reading his cursed energy, but his physical capabilities are enhanced tremendously. Yuta's strength and agility are improved to such a degree that he can contend with Yuji's superhuman prowess. Yuta's every attack carries enough destructive power to end a fight and his defense is so dense that it can restrict all incoming damage to a minimum.

       In addition to his superior reinforcement technique, another testament to Yuta's delicate control over his cursed energy his is mastery over reverse cursed energy. Reverse cursed technique is notoriously difficult to perform for sorcerers but Yuta can use it repeatedly without issue.

        While fighting in the Sendai Colony, Yuta effortlessly ripped a steel railing from the side of the road and threw it at Kurourushi

        Coupled with his ability to heal himself, Yuta comes off as near invulnerable to even the strongest assault. He tanked several blastwaves from Takako Uro and Ryu Ishigori's Granite Cannon head-on without sustaining and prolonged injuries.
        Proper defensive martial arts made him able to withstand Ryu's explosive cursed energy output. Ryu compares hitting Yuta to knocking against a massive water tank.
        Yuta was even able to deflect one of Ryu's beams with his bare hands and kept fighting after suffering several direct hits from Ryu and Uro. This made Uro recognize how tough Yuta is. Consistently reinforcing his body and healing it with reverse cursed technique helped Yuta stay in the fight, but it was still draining on his stamina and overall cursed energy.

       Rika can manifest on its own and lash out to protect Yuta without him commanding her to do so, but normally acts on Yuta's commands. Rika can act independently at a fair distance away from Yuta to perform separate tasks as well. It doesn't require Yuta to use any intense emotions to call Rika and it can manifest rather quickly, allowing Yuta to call her to his side at any moment's notice. Rika maintains her same trademark power as well, able to immobilize Yuji with ease and crumble a bride with a single strike.

      : Yuta has replicated Toge's ability to use cursed speech, a technique usually inherited through the Inumaki Family bloodline. When he first used it, Yuta performed the technique using a microphone that Rika summoned that had the Snake Eyes and Fangs symbol on it. By speaking through the microphone, Yuta was able to command every single one of Geto's swarm of lower-grade curses to die at once. He noted having difficulty controlling the spread of cursed energy.

       Yuta has since become more proficient with cursed speech. While connected to Rika through the ring, Yuta can even make the Snake Eyes and Fangs insignia appear on his mouth as if he was born with it. This allows him to activate the technique by speaking commands in the same manner that Toge does.

        While fighting in the Culling Game, Yuta used reverse cursed technique constantly to heal himself after getting hit by any big move. This helped him avoid long-term damage but severely drained his cursed energy. He also used it to exorcise Kurourushi, compromising the cursed spirit's body with a blast of reverse cursed energy.

        Her massive amounts of cursed energy directly fed Yuta's abilities and could be molded into any cursed technique. Fully manifesting the first time, Rika tore a large cursed spirit to pieces with little effort. Unleashing her power at full force, Rika was able to contend with every cursed spirit in Geto's arsenal at the time. Beyond the limits of her power, Rika was able to overpower Geto's maximum technique.

       Katanas
      </b>
      : Early in Yuta's training, Satoru took him to the cursed tool vault and provided him with a katana. The goal was for Yuta to learn to fight while also learning to channel cursed energy into an object. At first, Yuta struggled to properly focus his cursed energy on the blade and only managed shallow cuts against cursed spirits. After vigorous training and experience on missions, Yuta learns to properly wield the sword with Rika's power. However, it was a standard katana and could not take an overflow of cursed energy, breaking as a result. Yuta is able to replace his katanas whenever they break and his preferred form of combat eventually evolved into swordplay reinforced with jujutsu.

       Steel Arm
      </b>
      : Among the many weapons that Yuta keeps inside Rika is a metal arm casing that can be attached by Rika. The cursed tool covers Yuta's entire arm in a metal shell and further reinforces his punches. It was broken used to pummel Takako Uro but was eventually broken by the "ice breaker" effect of her cursed technique, absorbing the impact for Yuta.
