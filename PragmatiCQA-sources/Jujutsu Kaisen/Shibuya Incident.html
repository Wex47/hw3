   During Kokichi's battle with Mahito, his main objective is to contact Satoru Gojo. Kokichi wants Satoru to rescue him, and he also can use the opportunity to warn Satoru about the Shibuya plans.
   However, Kokichi is unsuccessful. He's unable to reach Satoru and is killed by the special grade curse. Immediately afterward, Geto regroups with Mahito and confirms they've finished putting the final touches on the plan. Just over ten days later, October 31st arrives.

Sorcerers can enter and exit the curtain at will but it depends on the person when it comes to windows. A secondary effect of the barrier doesn't allow for cellphone reception and it can't be broken by brute force, meaning dispelling the curtain is only possible by taking out its caster.

   ." An advanced barrier technique and targeting Satoru Gojo points to the culprits being the same as the invaders of the Goodwill Event. The higher-ups instruct Satoru Gojo to work alone in order to suppress the Shibuya Incident and minimize any potential casualties. They also dispatch four squads of jujutsu sorcerers to safeguard the perimeter outside the curtain in case anything gets past him:

   Non-sorcerers inside the curtain continue to bang their hands on the edge of the barrier and demand that someone hurry and bring Satoru Gojo. No one is sure who Satoru Gojo is or how they even ended up being told to request his presence. While some are sure help is on the way, others are on edge after seeing dozens of others sucked into Shibuya Mark City from the outside intersection.

   Satoru arrives at Hikarie ShinQ's at 8:38 PM where he stands on the atrium and looks over the crowd of civilians. He notices that the curtain is being cast from somewhere down below and decides to descend to the
   Fukutoshin Line Platform
   on B5F. Satoru realizes the cursed spirits are planning to ambush him down there but he openly welcomes the challenge.

   At 8:39 PM at
   Aoyama Cemetery
   in Harajuku, Yuji expresses his desire to back up his Gojo sensei. His team isn't not permitted to help Satoru Gojo, but rather than remain on standby at the cemetery, the Mei Mei Team is routed to
   Meiji-Jingumae Station
   where another curtain has suddenly appeared. At 8:40 PM, Satoru descends to the subway platform on Tokyo Metro B5F of the Hikarie Building where Jogo, Hanami, and Choso are waiting for him.

   Hanami's roots fill the atrium Satoru descended through, creating a blind spot. Satoru can't break it recklessly in the case of people are on the other side. He boasts that he has no reason to run anyway since the cursed spirits would kill everyone if he did. However, Jogo responds by declaring they'll murder everyone regardless. Crowds of non-sorcerers are forced onto the track around Satoru, flooding the area with bystanders that only serve to get in his way. Jogo, Hanami, and Choso cut down numerous civilians before making an attack on Satoru. The
   Infinity
   stops Jogo and Hanami from making contact with Satoru, but they came prepared for this exchange. Jogo and Hanami activate

  </p>
  <p key="25652c3a-fee4-4733-8275-366d30fa3060">
   Pseudo-Geto prepared Jogo and the others for this battle by informing them that Satoru is at his strongest when he's alone. Even strong sorcerers get in Satoru's way so Geto and the others planned on using inferior non-sorcerers to restrict his movements and his ability to activate powerful cursed techniques including

  </p>
  <p key="193c1df8-9457-4b7f-9d71-abeecd483c5b">
   Satoru quickly figures out his opponents' game and removes his blindfold, revealing the Six Eyes. He taunts the curses for thinking any strategy could give them an advantage and confronts them directly.

   without the use of the Limitless. He lures Hanami into deactivating his Domain Amplification and then exposes his weak point to severely weaken him. This makes it so the next time Hanami and Jogo attempt to deactivate the Infinity, Satoru simply amplifies his technique to overpower Hanami and exorcises him completely.

   At 8:51 PM in Harajuku, the Mei Mei Team arrives at Meiji-Jinguemae Station just over ten minutes after departing Aoyama Cemetery on foot. They meet with an auxiliary manager at exit 2. She debriefs them on the full extent of the situation they're expected to tackle. A second curtain has appeared with the ability to block out sorcerers from entering B5F of any of the Tokyo Metro stations. This curtain is centered at Meiji-Jinguemae Station and it is believed its caster is taking the risk of remaining outside of the barrier in order to strengthen it. Somewhere in between the curtains is the caster and a swarm if transfigured humans to back them up.
  </p>
  <p key="bab08cf5-6b4c-4683-95f7-9c71f1d35efc">
   Mei Mei uses her crows to scout out the inside of the Meiji-Jinguemae Station. She finds that transfigured humans are attacking trapped civilians at B4F and forcing them down to B5F. Many of her crows were taken out between B1F and B2F, meaning the caster is most likely in that area. This could be due to the caster wanting to prevent civilians from escaping or a part of the vow strengthening the barrier. Mei Mei is unsure of why B5F is chosen as the cutoff point and Yuji asks if the special grade patch face-curse might be down there.
  </p>
  <p key="8d68dcbf-4221-4a1d-b463-4f1adcab9cc7">
   Mei Mei suggests splitting up so she can rescue the civilians on B4F before they're all killed by transfigured humans. She and Ui Ui head to exit 7 and go straight down to B4F while Yuji descends through exit 2 to find the curtain's caster. Their best-case scenario is to regroup after the curtain has been lifted when the civilians are freed and the objectives of the enemy at BF5 have been discovered.

   there devouring a man's head. The Grasshopper considers themselves to be "smart". Based on talking to the curse, Yuji surmises that it's unlikely that such a low intelligence creature would be able to cast a complicated barrier. The Grasshopper also mentions needing to "protect" the curtain, making Yuji realize it's an item responsible for the curtain instead of a caster. He makes it his goal to break the cursed object projecting the barrier and fights the Grasshopper Curse one-on-one.
   The Grasshopper Curse believes it has a superior body to a human. However, Yuji's skill is so far ahead that he completely overcomes any natural disadvantages. The gap in skill is so wide that Yuji effortlessly exorcises the curse and breaks the stake-like cursed object to dispel the barrier.

   Mei Mei kills a group of transfigured humans and secures the civilians on B4F. She notices the curtain lifting and tells Ui Ui they'll wait to regroup with Yuji before heading down to B5F. At the same time on BF5, Mahito gets ready to board a train going from Harajuku to Shibuya Station.

   After exorcising Hanami, Satoru puts Jogo on the defensive and forces him to hide amongst the crowd of civilians and rely solely on hit-and-run tactics. People who can't see curses start to avoid Satoru and their depleting numbers give Satoru a higher chance of spotting his enemies. Satoru understands he can't save everyone but he swears to exorcise the curses in return. Pseudo-Geto watches the chaos with Dagon from a safe distance away. He comments that it's still too easy for Satoru and they'll need to get him more on edge.
   At 9:15 PM, Mahito's train arrives on the Fukutoshin Line Platform of Shibuya Station. Frightened civilians try to escape on the newly arrived train. Unbeknownst to them its filled with transfigured humans that attack them as the doors open.

   Mahito regroups with Jogo and Choso while numerous transfigured humans chase after the civilians running away in a panic. Satoru doesn't understand why his adversaries would whittle down the number of non-sorcerers even further but Mahito reveals there are plenty more to sacrifice for their cause. The atrium that was being blocked by Hanami's roots suddenly opens up and a massive crowd of people falls through it. Satoru realizes there are more curses or curse users on the upper floors of the Hikarie Building dumping everyone they can down to B5F.
  </p>
  <p key="bf2cbe8d-344f-401c-8c5a-3e18d0cdfa6f">
   Choso, Mahito, and Jogo use their cursed techniques to attack the crowd along with the transfigured humans. They understand Satoru is capable of dealing with some sacrifices, but only those killed by curses and not himself. His enemies believe this puts Satoru in a situation where he can't activate Domain Expansion at risk of harming any nearby non-sorcerers. However, Satoru proves them wrong and releases an all-or-nothing Domain Expansion of just 0.2 seconds.

   without suffering lasting aftereffects. It feeds about half a year's worth of information into everyone's mind, leaving them standing unconscious. This level of Unlimited Void could allow the cursed spirits to awaken at any moment, so Satoru focuses on destroying all the transfigured humans as quickly as possible. The strongest sorcerer annihilates approximately one thousand transfigured humans in 299 seconds.

  <p key="4d431571-9fcc-4daf-9a2d-fa1c157fe63d">
   Immediately after his tremendous feat, Satoru is surprised when Prison Realm appears right next to him. Without wasting any time, Geto commands the cursed object to open.
   Prison Realm breaks out of the paper talismans constraining it and opens up into a gate-like shape with a giant eye in the center that meets Satoru's gaze. The sorcerer instinctively moves to get away from Prison Realm but Pseudo-Geto intercepts him. This is the first time Pseudo-Geto has revealed his existence to Satoru. Satoru is left speechless at the sight of his former best friend's body functioning despite having killed Geto with his own hands.
  </p>
  <p key="81fc07d5-e4a4-41c7-b039-23dc9de5d14b">
   Prior to the incident, Geto informed Jogo and the others that they would need to hold Satoru in place for one minute after Prison Realm's gate is opened. Jogo believed this to be an impossible task, but Geto only needs "one minute" of time inside of Satoru's high processing brain. Upon seeing Geto, three years of memories race through Satoru's mind. This gives Prison Realm more than enough time to activate and take hold of him.
  </p>
  <p key="4128ed59-6ef9-4e47-9fad-57d23a1e24c9">
   Immobilized and unable to access his cursed energy, Satoru understands this is checkmate. He demands to know who this imposter is despite the Six Eyes telling him it's Suguru Geto. The imposter takes off the top of his head and reveals a cursed brain inside. It's a technique that allows the imposter to move from body to body. He took over Geto's body after the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons. Pseudo-Geto fastens his scalp back on and tells Satoru the seal will be over in a thousand years or so, bidding him farewell until they meet again in the new world.

   Around 9:26 PM, Geto commands Prison Realm to close its gate, sealing Satoru inside the cubed form of the cursed object. Mahito and the others wake up from their Unlimited Void induced trance and regroup with Geto. He reveals Prison Realm can only contain one person at a time and it needs time to process someone as powerful as Satoru Gojo. In spite of this minor delay, Pseudo-Geto's plan has been successful and the seal is complete.

   Geto reveals they won't be able to move Prison Realm while it's processing Satoru. Their conversation is overheard by one of Mechamaru's communication devices. The information is delivered directly to the jujutsu sorcerers. Geto and Mahito both notice the device after already revealing they can't move Prison Realm. Mahito destroys the device, but Geto acknowledges they acted a moment too late, admitting the jujutsu sorcerers got them.

   Upon entering the curtain, Yuji notices numerous transfigured humans attacking civilians. While running to his destination, Yuji takes the time to quickly kill all of the transfigured humans in the area and rescues all the civilians he can. Then he athletically jumps atop a building with superhuman agility and screams as loud as he can. Hoping to get a message to Nanami, Yuji yells out loud that Satoru Gojo has been sealed. The message reaches the Nanami Team and anyone else in the vicinity loud and clear. Nanami changes plans and tells the entire team they must meet up with Yuji and confirm the situation. He emphasizes that if Satoru Gojo has been truly sealed, this could mean the end of all humans in Japan.

   Akari informs Nobara that it sounded as if Ijichi was attacked while they were on the phone.

   Nanami tries not to be frustrated by his own inabilities, but finding Ijichi in a near-death situation infuriates him.
   He takes Ijichi straight to

   At the same time on Bunkamura Street, Nobara asks Akari to pretend like she's hiding in
   Bunkamura station
   while actually escaping through Tokyu. She quickly deduces that Shigemo was the one who attacked Ijichi and that he's targeting managers. Akari follows instructions and runs into the subway while Nobara engages the curse user in combat. Nobara believes Shigemo is a mid-ranged fighter who heavily relies on a cursed tool. However, this results in Nobara heavily underestimating her opponent.

   Shigemo's cursed tool has more functions than it would initially appear. The curse user's sword independently tracks Akari and injures her to prevent the manager from escaping. This happens all while Shigemo is able to avoid the girl of steel's attacks at close range. Once Akari is hurt, Shigemo runs into Bunkamura Station and attacks her himself. Nobara tries to fight and protect her friend, but Shigemo lands several precise blows that stagger the first-year sorcerer.

   Battered and desperate, Shigemo admits doesn't know anything useful information regarding the other curse users.

Nanami also informs them about the situation surrounding Satoru's sealing and asks them to remain on standby until they can be escorted out of the city. He plans on regrouping with the Zenin Team at Shibuya Station and heading down to B5F to rescue Satoru.

Regardless of this, Mechamaru does formulate a risky plan with a low success  rate that just might give Yuji a fighting chance. Yuji retreats to the bathroom and leads Choso inside where he has all the water running from every stall and sink. With water spraying everywhere in the enclosed space, the osmotic pressure of the water forces blood to dissolve at a cellular level and makes it so that Choso is unable to control blood outside his body.

   Now fighting on an even playing field, Yuji welcomes Choso to his turf. The sorcerer is finally able to engage Choso in a contest of hand-to-hand combat without the use of cursed techniques. He's able to quickly gain an edge over Choso in taijutsu but this is short-lived. The Death Painting secured some blood kept in his left hand and ensured it wasn't permeated by the water. By hardening it and flicking it into Yuji's torso, Choso manages to pierce his opponent's liver.

   Yuji can quickly feel that he's been hit in a vital organ. After briefly panicking, Yuji regains his cool and converts his fear into cursed energy. Unafraid of death, Yuji embraces his role and accepts he might die taking down Choso. He's okay with this as long as Satoru Gojo is saved in the end. Choso has only been hit three clean times but Yuji, but has still suffered extensive damage. Determining Yuji is a more severe threat than possibly developing onset thrombosis, Choso hardens the blood inside his lead arm.

   The two fighters engage in one final exchange of blows. Once again Yuji is able to gain the upper hand over Choso in close quarters combat. Just as he has Choso staged, Yuji is unable to capitalize. His follow-up strike has no impact at all because Choso predicted where Yuji would strike and hardened that piece of his body with blood as well. Choso quickly counterattacks, crushing Yuji with two consecutive blows that send the first-year crashing into the bathroom wall so ferociously it cracks from the impact.

  <p key="609ea368-94f0-4844-bc6b-bb0a3f1c1f07">
   Victorious, Choso prepares to finish Yuji off and get proper revenge for his brothers. However, in that moment a sudden memory is born inside Choso's brain of a past even that never happened.
   Sukuna looks on, disappointed with Yuji's performance. He's surprised as he watches Yuji is ultimately spared by his opponent. Choso's head throbs with a memory of him sitting beside Yuji, Eso, Kecuhizu and all six of his other brothers. The Death Painting can't make sense of why Yuji is calling him big brother in this sequence and stumbles away from his opponent's battered body.

After taunting his allies for being too slow, Naobito punches Dagon out of the frame and the impact sends the curse crashing across the room. It all happens too fast for Nanami and Maki to follow. Nanami is able to recognize this is due to a cursed technique but is still surprised by the unprecedented level of speed exerted.  
Dagon is severely injured by Naobito's attack and vomits numerous bones that belong to deceased non-sorcerers the curse devoured. Injured with no hope of victory, Dagon begins to cry out loud for help. Dagon calls out to each of his allies by name until he reaches Hanami. Dagon quickly realizes that Hanami has died and becomes enraged by the demise of his friend.

  <p key="a3091e2a-4c66-4f7c-bb6c-26b1e18340ca">
   Due to the multiple irregular circumstances that allowed Granny Ogami's seance technique to run rampant, Toji's psyche devolves into a puppet of carnage, bearing his fangs towards the strongest potential adversary around. He forcefully takes Playful Cloud from Maki and quickly overpowers Dagon with pure physicality and innate fighting prowess.

   Toji shreds through all Dagon's strongest shikigami before pummeling the special grade until he's bloody and close to defeat. While Toji sharpens Playful Cloud to a point, Dagon attempts to buy time to regain control over the domain and his can't-miss attacks. Noabito stops Dagon from getting away, allowing Toji to stab the cursed spirit through the face with Playful Cloud.

  <p key="6baff054-75a7-4e81-9da3-74ff6883ac69">
   Toji repeatedly stabs Dagon at extreme speed until the special grade is exorcised completely. The domain dissipates and Toji takes Megumi outside to the street through a glass window. Before Maki can follow Megumi, Jogo abruptly appears and mourns Dagon's death. Jogo acts quickly and avenges his ally by setting Maki, Nanami, and Naobito ablaze one after the other. Before he can end the trio for good, Jogo notices Sukuna's cursed energy being released somewhere in Shibuya.

   Mimiko and Nanako feed Yuji's unconscious body the finger of Sukuna's in their possession and Jogo catches them in the act shortly after. They're able to escape Jogo's wrath using Nanako's cursed technique, leaving the cursed spirit alone with Yuji's still unconscious body. Jogo notices Sukuna's markings still present on Yuji's face and decides it's now or never to feed the vessel all ten of Sukuna's fingers in his possession.
  </p>
  <p key="b2725f99-b3ea-486b-aed8-472a02088141">
   Jogo's act has put Yuji at fifteen fingers total. While Jogo is still holding Yuji up, he notices Mimiko and Nanako didn't escape very far away. Sukuna awakens and demands Jogo get away from him immediately, severing the hand holding Yuji's face. Sukuna's overwhelmingly evil presence demands that the Jogo, Mimiko, and Nanako bow before him.

   Sukuna decides to give the two girls one finger's worth of time to hear them out. They beg him to kill Pseudo-Geto but he's displeased with them using their time to order him around. Sukuna brutally murders Mimiko and then Nanako shortly after before she can retaliate and avenge her twin sister.
  </p>
  <p key="c3f51cf2-c23c-45be-ab40-2dd3db2f524d">
   Sukuna moves on to asking Jogo what he wants and is surprised to learn that his group simply wants to see Sukuna revived. Jogo tells Sukuna to use Yuji's friends as leverage to make a Binding Vow to permanently take over the vessel. Sukuna claims this isn't necessary and reveals that he has his own plans. Amused with Jogo, Sukuna offers him a challenge as a token of appreciation for ten fingers. If Jogo can land a single hit on Sukuna in a fight, the King of Curses will cooperate with his group and kill every human in Shibuya, all except for one.

   Just outside the station, Megumi faces Toji alone out on the street. He tries to visualize winning against an impossibly powerful opponent but his focus is suddenly shaken. Both Fushiguros are taken by surprise when Sukuna's presence echoes throughout Shibuya. Megumi tries to use Rabbit Escape to buy time self-composure but this is short-lived. Toji instinctively charges into the horde of rabbits and stabs forward with his improvised spear. Megumi is able to avoid Toji's attack and continues to create distance.

   At 10:51 PM along the Shibuya Line of the Metropolitan Expressway, Shoko and Yaga converse inside the tent they have set up on the tollgate. The tent is a makeshift medical station to treat injured sorcerers to treat the injured. Shoko and she's already managed to save the lives of Ino and Ijichi, and Yaga is there to protect her in case the enemy learns she's in Shibuya.

   On the other hand, Shoko's presence in Shibuya gives Megumi insurance. He knows his sole advantage is that he can be healed and decides to take a direct hit from his opponent. Using his shadow to divert the strike, Megumi is able to avoid a fatal wound. He tries to counterattack at point-blank range but Toji is immensely fast and completely avoids the hit, leaving the young student with no options left.

   Toji takes a solid look at Megumi's face and recalls the day he agreed to sell him to the Zenin Family. Toji believes Megumi has a lot more potential to thrive in a sorcerer family than himself. He asks Megumi's name and the young man, Megumi answers "Fushiguro". Proud he chose Fushiguro over Zenin, Toji tells Megumi that's good for him and commits suicide. Toji stabs his own head with Playful Cloud to save his son, all unbeknownst to Megumi, who watches in shock.

   Ogami's grandson's body reverts back to normal and Megumi notes that Toji's face disappears completely. Megumi considers himself lucky but still can't make sense of why his opponent suddenly killed himself. While holding the flesh wound in his side, Megumi begins to walk toward where Shoko is posted until he decides that he should check on the Zenin Team first. However, Megumi is suddenly slashed in the back by Haruta Shigemo's bladed cursed tool. As Megumi collapses to the ground, Shigemo expresses that he's much more suited to sneak attacks instead of head-to-head collisions.

   At 11:01 PM in front of Shibuya Stream, the Kusakabe Team is still patrolling and checking buildings for civilians. They've already come across Toge and confirmed Satoru's sealing. Toge informed them that most non-sorcerers are safe. Panda wants to go after Satoru but he doesn't know where Fukutoshin Line B5F is or how to get there. His instincts as a Panda leave him without any sense of direction.

  <p key="6c818116-b1e0-4286-a38c-5ebb2973cdde">
   When Panda asks his teacher to stop checking buildings to go find Satoru, Kuksakabe claims Satoru isn't the only person that matters and they need to leave no stone unturned. These are obviously just excuses but Panda doesn't catch on. Kusakabe doesn't want to go down to B5F because he believes he'll die for sure. Panda's nose gets sharper as fewer people are around, running the risk of discovering B5F on his own. Kusakabe doesn't desire this option either because he'd rather not be alone in Shibuya.

   Panda doesn't realize that the Fukutoshin Line is right around the corner from where they are and would take no time at all to get there. Kusakabe decides to buy time by entering the station from the Shin-Minami entrance and pretending to get lost on their way to find Satoru. Before the Kusakabe Team can enter Shibuya Station, they're abruptly confronted by two curse users who used to be aligned with Suguru Geto:

   Toshihisa Negi asks if the two are Jujutsu High sorcerers and then tells them to surrender because he'd rather not kill one of his own kind. Kusakabe subtly refuses to any terms of surrender and instead asks the curse users to tell their story in the most drawn-out way possible. Negi simply expresses that they've inherited Suguru Geto's will and Manami asks again if Kusakabe will surrender. Kusakabe is disappointed they didn't waste very much time, but he isn't intimidated by curse users of this level either. He decides the best way to play this is by taking his sweet time fighting against these curse users instead of risking happening upon any special grades.

   Kusakabe activates Evening Moon Sword Drawing, signaling to Negi that the decision to fight has been made. However, Kusakabe's plan goes up in flames when a nearby explosion erupts behind the curse users. Sukuna knocks Jogo out of that building with explosive force and asks the cursed spirit if that's all the fight he's got.
   Jogo tries to fight back but is knocked across the area by Sukuna, destroying several more buildings with their highly destructive clashing. This struggle eventually forces Jogo to activate his most powerful cursed technique,

   The King of Curses forces all of them to watch as Maximum: Meteor draws closer and closer. It's only until just before the meteor makes impact that Sukuna finally allows them all to run. Maximum Meteor crashes into the ground moments later, destroying a large portion of the city and likely getting everyone caught up in the explosion. Jogo is confident that his maximum technique must've damaged his adversary but Sukuna managed to avoid it altogether. Amused regardless, Sukuna decides to utilize a cursed technique that conjures flames, confusing Jogo. Sukuna realizes that a cursed spirit wouldn't quite understand how he's performing this technique and simply challenges Jogo to a fire-power battle.

   The outcome of the highly chaotic battle is settled with a single exchange of destructive flames. Sukuna is victorious, reducing Jogo to ash. Before Jogo's demise, Sukuna met him inside his innate domain and commended him on his strength, drawing tears from the dying cursed spirit's eye. After Jogo's body crumbles away, Uraume finds Sukuna, surprising him. Sukuna recognizes Uraume and even calls them by name, meaning they're someone he knows from the past.

The curse user doesn't think anything of Megumi's explanation at first but the Ten Shadows Technique user unveils his last-ditch plan.

After suffering a hit from Sukuna's techniques, the wheel on its head turns and all the damage disappears. Additionally, Mahoraga will be unaffected by that same attack the next time it's used. Sukuna counters by activating his Domain Expansion:

He's horrified by Sukuna's actions and begins to vomit while panicking and telling himself to die. After a few moments of reeling from the traumatic experience, Yuji enters a state of cold focus.

   Satisfied with crushing Yuji's psyche and his body, Mahito goes in for the kill. An instant before he beheads his longtime adversary, a clapping sound echoes through the corridor. Mahito suddenly switches places with none other than Yuji's official best friend Aoi Todo. He's accompanied by

All jujutsu sorcerers must continue moving forward until they find that answer. By applying his innate technique to Yuji's wounds, Arata dulls the pain and ensures the injuries won't get any worse. In order to give Yuji a small ray of hope, Arata tells him that he treated Nobara with his technique as well before retreating with her.

   While fighting Todo one-on-one, Mahito has trouble dealing with the "top-knot gorilla's" evasive techniques. The special grade curse remains confident he'll use Black Flash again and unlock the true essence of his soul. Mahito is so infatuated with himself that this momentary distraction leaves him surprised when Todo switches places with Yuji.

   Back in the fight, Yuji apologizes to Nanami for almost giving up and promises to take on his share of suffering as well. Yuji lands a powerful Black Flash that completely destroys Mahito's block.

Todo welcomes his best friend back to the battle as Yuji stands next to him ready to go.

Mechamaru manipulated their missions to make sure no one would be near Shibuya on October 31st. By the time Mechamaru's peers found out, it was too late for them to get there in time to help. Todo and Arata are exceptions because Todo is more than strong enough to take care of himself and Arata's innate technique is useful in this situation. Mechamaru uses the remaining time within his communication device to share a somber goodbye with

   Yuji and Todo fight another special grade together, this time it's Mahito together inside Shibuya Station. Mahito tries to formulate a strategy around calculating the strength of each combatant's soul. Todo is operating at full strength while Mahito and Yuji have less than half their maximum health.

   Mahito is surprised by Boogie Woogie's ability to swap places with an un-activated transfigured human, allowing Todo to get behind him. Determined not to be left behind by Yuji, Todo unleashes Black Flash as well through a kick that destroys Mahito's hand. Although Todo's attack doesn't damage Mahito's soul, the cursed spirit acknowledges that all combatants are now operating at 120% of their potential. He decides to turn up the intensity of the fight and counters Boogie Woogie by attacking with Idle Transfiguration:

   Mahito's first objective is to separate Todo from Yuji to get rid of the constant switching. He activates Idle Transfiguration:

   A single counterattack from the Todo is able to put a Polymorphic Soul Isomer down. This exchange reveals the Polymorphic Soul Isomer's weakness to Todo, allowing him to dispatch two more with ease. Mahito tries to capitalize while he has Yuji alone but it's not long before Todo rejoins his best friend's side. Without any other choice, Mahito decides to take a page out of Satoru Gojo's book and activates an all-or-nothing Domain Expansion of only 0.2 seconds!
  </p>
  <p key="14430a21-6983-49f7-b347-a21cfb70b627">
   At 120% of his potential thanks to Black Flash, Mahito combined the two step-process of realizing his innate domain and activating his innate technique into one. This sublimely fast maneuver out-speeds both Todo and Yuji's attempts to counter the domain. After briefly mocking Sukuna inside the King of Curse's innate domain, Mahito defiantly finishes the activation of

   Only Todo's hand is transfigured, but he's forced to sever it, leaving him wide open to Mahito's next attack. The cursed spirit can't transfigure Todo so soon after activating Domain Expansion but does the next best thing lands a direct hit using Black Flash. Todo miraculously survives by concentrating all his cursed energy to defend the point of impact and minimize the damage.

   Todo is still badly hurt so Mahito tries to follow up by transfiguring the top-knot gorilla. Mahito is momentarily distracted by the picture of Yuji inside of Todo's severed pendent. Todo does the unexpected and claps using Mahito's outstretched hand, swapping places with Yuji, who is already mid-swing. Before Mahito can even react, Yuji lands a devastating Black Flash that smashes his opponent's face

   Miraculously, Todo's palm is only slightly-disfigured from touching Mahito, but he's out of the fight. Yuji thanks Todo for all his help and believes in himself to handle the rest. Mahito uses another Polymorphic Soul Isomer to occupy Yuji while he recovers from being hit with Black Flash. He commends Todo for being a pain till the very end but the special was still able to use a Black Flash of his own again. Realizing the true essence of his soul, Mahito evolves into his final form using Idle Transfiguration:

   Elevated into a much more powerful form, Mahito attempts to celebrate his rebirth by ending Yuji. Mahito's body is too hard for Yuji to damage and trading offense doesn't bode well either. Yuji's only choice is to dedicate all his cursed energy to a maximum output Black Flash. Although Mahito has become much stronger, the damage from Yuji's last Black Flash still lingers. The two of them take a moment to regain their footing before rushing into one final fight to the finish.

  <p key="a1adbcb3-1847-4773-9e9e-06190dd8e4ad">
   Mahito gives Yuji a target to hit on his nigh-invulnerable body but the sorcerer doesn't take the bait. Yuji controls Divergent Fist's second impact and takes Mahito by surprise, throwing off the angle of what would've been a killing blow. Before Mahito can adjust, Todo reappears and fakes out the cursed spirit by "clapping" with his severed hand. This makes Mahito turn around, but Boogie Woogie did not activate. Todo's fake out gives Yuji the perfect opening to land full-power, fight-ending Black Flash that utterly defeats Mahito.

   Yuji confronts Mahito one last time and admits that they are the same. Yuji doesn't need a reason to kill cursed spirits just as Mahito never needed one to kill humans. Yuji accepts that he's a cog in the war between sorcerers and cursed spirits. Mahito attempts to flee and Yuji chases him like a predator hunting their prey through the snow. Before Yuji can catch up and finish Mahito off, however, Pseudo-Geto appears to come to his ally's aid.

   In the wake of the Shibuya Incident, Pseudo-Geto causes at least ten million cursed spirits to get released. The destruction spreads from Shibuya and all throughout Tokyo, causing all twenty-three wards to fall. This results in a literal void in the country, both politically and on the grid.

Jujutsu sorcerers are guarding the evacuees, but a plan must be formulated to relocate over five million citizens.

One countermeasure presented is to expand the two barriers to the edge of the prefecture. One barrier is centered around an Imperial Residence established during the Meiji Era and the other around Tokyo Jujutsu High. That way they can be established as restricted areas and become completely uninhabited by humans.
