   who agreed to fight Adelheid. Upon establishing their prides they agreed to decide the winner on who could steal the others armband first. Adelheid then leapt down the cliff while using her
   Glacier flames
   to freeze the waterfall on her descent. Before following, Hibari asked Tsuna to pay careful attention to the fight. Hibari then revealed his
   Vongola Gear
   which modified his own uniform and his tonfas.

   Adelheid then commented that she wouldn't need to attack and jumped into the waterfall. Using her Glacier flame she formed a huge ice castle within the waterfall that she claimed to be impenetrable even to an attack as powerful as the

   . Hibari pointed out her inability to take his armband but she responded by creating five hundred ice

   from the river surrounding Hibari. As he watched with

   established his confidence in Adelheid naming her the passion of Simon and explaining how she was responsible for reuniting the originally worthless Simon, and that his plan to manipulate them by possessing
   Julie Kato
   wouldn't have worked without her passion. Adelheid then ordered her puppets to attack Hibari, causing him to unleash a wave of bladed chains from his tonfa's. Hibari then proclaimed his pride is something he cannot give up. Hibari continued to defeat many Blizzardroids with his Vongola Gear using his chains
   and Handcuffs. Demon commented that Hibari shared many traits with Vongola Primo's strongest guardian and the first

   , and wondered if this was a second coming of Primo's Family. Hibari then extended his chains with the cloud flame's propagation ability and whirled it around, destroying all of Adelheid's remaining Puppets. Hibari turned to Adelheid, ready to destroy the
   Diamond Castle
   however, she created another group of ice puppets. When Adelheid asked why he sides with Tsuna, Hibari replied that he didn't and asked back why Adelheid siding with

   who he calls a small animal. Hibari then jumped to the Diamond castle and tried to destroy it with his full power but failed only managing to make a small crack. Hibari then explained that in some cases, small animal aren't weaklings and have their own way to survive. Hibari then used Roll who began propagating from within the cracks he had made, expanding and destroying the castle. Hibari then appeared behind Adelheid with his tonfa held to her throat. Adelheid commented that despite his belief of being uncontrollable he was still the underling of Tsuna. To this he admitted that she had a point, but pointed out that this was only because it allowed him free reign and that he would one day defeat even Tsuna. Hibari then took Adelheids Armband and declared his win.
