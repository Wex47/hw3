He begins to reveal that the island has a special defense structure in place and Mukuro's illusions cannot reach her. The reason that Chrome's organs were still functioning well was that he was the one who created them in place of Mukuro.
Chrome at first doesn't want to believe this, stating that she received the body from Mukuro. Julie then tests it by making her organs disappear, which they do, making Chrome's stomach sink and making her cough blood. He tells her that the reason he went that far to help her even though they were enemies was that both Chrome and her body are important to him and then he recreates her organs. Julie then offers her to become his, which Chrome quickly refuses and says that she doesn't need the organs that he made, which surprises Julie and he decides to tell her his secret.

   On the way to the Simon hideout, Lambo asks Tsuna to play with him since he was silent all the way due to the shock he received when Enma revealed to them about his father. Suddenly, a helicopter appears and flies away and Gokudera uses this to cheer up Tsuna but fails. Tsuna then finally speaks, he isn't sure if he is doing the right thing anymore because he thought that Enma isn't lying since he could feel his sorrow and sadness through his fist. Reborn then comments that he also thinks that Enma isn't lying but he also said that even though what Enma said was true Reborn wonders if the Simon really wanted things to turn out this way as he said that when Enma attacked them, something didn't feel right, suspecting there's a dark shadow behind the Simon.

He changes back to Julie as he says that he wants to quickly get used to controlling her mind so she should be by his side all the time.

Giotto who is bewildered by this information is confused as to how Cozzato came to know of the war, and intends to rescue his friend without hesitation. However, Demon Spade assures the Primo that he will be the one to assist the Simon, which Giotto accepts and is relieved by. When the memory ends, everyone realizes that someone has set a trap for Cozzato, since Giotto had never spoken of the Vongola's war to Cozzato. Hibari then realizes someone is watching them and throws his handcuff towards the figure who reveals himself to be Julie along with Chrome. Adelheid asks Julie to take care of Enma, to which Julie agrees but then continues by saying that from now on he will leave his place in the Simon Famiglia.

   When Tsuna asks why he's done all that he has, Demon simply answers it is all for the sake of the Vongola. He states that Giotto was a great leader but lacked ambition in the mafia world, where power and greed are the only absolute justice. He continues, saying that with Giotto's nature it would have been impossible to create the flawless Vongola Famiglia and therefore, he would do anything necessary to eliminate anything and anyone that will weaken the Vongola—just like Cozzato and the Simon whom he saw as a threat. Thus, admitting that he was the cause of Simon Cozzato's death. Demon tells of how he used the Simon's dormant power amplified by hatred in order to try and eliminate the tenth boss candidate who would try to succeed Primo's will. This angers Adelheid who then realizes that Julie must still exist and demands from Demon where he is and what he has done to him. However, the first Mist Guardian answers that there is probably a slight bit of "that garbage" left inside him and Adelheid tearfully apologizes to Enma. Demon comments that the Simon are a bunch of inexperienced children after all. However, at this moment, Kaoru appears and stabs Demon from behind.

However, to betray Yamamoto, who he sees as his friend, is unbearable to him and he wants to pay for the crimes he has committed and apologizes to Adelheid, for he no longer has any capability to fight the Vongola. Demon mocks him as trash and useless and then says that thanks to his loss, they are finally able to see a fantastic show. The fifth key is revealed to be a document with a Dying Will Flame on it.

   At Simon's place, which was surrounded by enemies, Demon Spade's subordinates arrive, saying that they have come to help them. However, Cozzato knew that they were sent by Demon to kill him, since he knew that the third letter that he received was fake because the letter was signed "from Primo" and Giotto would never refer himself that way to him. Cozzato turns into Hyper Dying Will Mode, stating that he will fight until the end for his friends and his Famiglia. At this, Demon Spade's subordinates tear apart the letter and reveal themselves as G and the other Guardians that were ordered to assist them by Giotto, who had seen through Demon Spade's plan. G assures Cozzato that the men with him are just like him, Giotto's guardians, and that they can be trusted. G explains that they could've gone all out but they didn't want Demon to know that they were saving him and told Cozzato the four guardians would fight the enemies, while he and Cozzato would go to Giotto. Before they go, Cozzato thanks G and the others.
As the memories ended, which revealed that Cozzato had not been killed, it shocks all of the participants, especially Demon, who then shouts in disbelief that Giotto had saw through his plan. Reborn said that it seems the history of the Simon has been rewritten. Tsuna happily exclaims that Giotto never betrayed Cozzato and that their friendship never wavered at all. Demon furiously curses Giotto, who had faked Cozzato's death, but is interjected by Reborn who wonders if Cozzato had never been assassinated, then why are there no lying records of him afterwards, much to everyones confusion.

Cozzato explained that he had a strong feeling that it won't be a simple task to eliminate Demon Spade and if Demon continued living, the Simon would only be a burden. Therefore, it would be better if Simon just went into hiding and disappeared from the mafia world and any view, much to Giotto's protest.
