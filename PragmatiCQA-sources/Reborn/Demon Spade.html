   Mist Guardian, he wore a French-like blue military uniform that he sometimes buttoned, yellow epaulette, white long pants, and brown boots. He wore a red shirt beneath his uniform and wore his lens around his neck like a necklace. Like
   Mukuro Rokudo
   , he also has a blue-haired pineapple-like hairstyle but shorter with two zigzag partings, lighter hair color and has bangs.
  </p>
  <p key="b85051c9-a4cc-49d2-8c13-e537312cdaf0">
   Later, in the Inheritance Ceremony Arc, when he possessed
   Julie's
   body, he was shown to have longer hair much like Mukuro and wore a long jacket with grey color on the outside and green pickle color on the inside along with its hoodie, white long pants, silver belt, black boots with several spade patterns and a black suit with white ties beneath the jacket.
  </p>
  <p key="4638a1ea-1fc7-4b5b-b0db-b2113c530c05">
   After possessing Mukuro's body, he retained his pineapple-like hairstyle and had much longer hair that fell below his waist and was tied at the tips to form a distinctive dolphin-tail split. He wore a different outfit; a different military uniform that consisted of a white-colored cloth with the Vongola emblem pattern on its buttons, and a pair of spaulders with the same Vongola emblem and a spade, white gloves, black pants, and white boots. Since he was possessing Mukuro's body, his right eye was red-colored.

    Personality
   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="5f544672-1872-48f1-b0d0-820c6838cdb1">
   Originating from an aristocratic background, Demon speaks in an intellectual and formal yet surprisingly polite manner. This is most likely due to the nobilities' upbringing with strict codes of behavior. One of the examples is that he address himself as "watashi", refers to others as "anata", and ends his sentences with "desu" and "masu" in Japanese. Though, if he is thoroughly annoyed or enraged, he would drop the politeness altogether.
  </p>
  <p key="b690aed6-1c30-43dc-8f5f-bbc9466c28c5">
   He used to be kind and compassionate, having the desire to protect the weak and defenseless, much like Giotto. Unlike nobles in general, Demon did not degrade commoners or indulge in luxury. Instead, he believed that no matter what position people had in life, highly capable people should become the backbone of society. He deeply loved the Vongola Famiglia that fulfilled their goal to protect people and fix the outlaws and dedicated everything he had for the Famiglia. From beginning, Demon already believed that power is necessary to control peace. This changed into obsession after
   Elena's
   death, turning him ruthless, cruel, inconsiderate, and merciless to enemies. He became determined to make Vongola the strongest organization which can easily crush other Mafia Famiglias, a heavy contradiction with the opinions of Primo and the
   other Guardians
   . However, while twisted, Demon truly believed that only through Vongola's guidance when it's at its strongest that peace can be maintained.
  </p>
  <p key="7ad5cf43-6396-4b66-86c4-f9dd1f9c2770">
   His obsession resulted in his intolerance of any form of weakness within Vongola, and instead believe that power and greed are the absolute justice in the Mafia world. He will do anything in order to create the Vongola that he desires and has no hesitation to kill innocent people, even if they are children or women, if he thinks sacrifices are necessary. This devotion continues even after many generations and led to his decision to annihilate
   <a href="Tsunayoshi Sawada.html" key="0093c3d6-6fd4-4214-81ba-627f66f9d179" title="Tsunayoshi Sawada">
    Tsuna's
   </a>
   Family so that he could recreate the Vongola in his image. His personality is overall quite similar to that of his modern-day counterpart, Mukuro, although he wants the Vongola to be strong whereas Mukuro has different goals in mind.
  </p>
  <p key="27f07655-021d-4902-8b28-6271822d3b9c">
   Having been a veteran Vongola member for hundreds of years, he is an intelligent and cunning individual. He mostly opted to act behind the scenes, arranging the chains of events by carefully deceiving or controlling people who are involved and waiting until he ensured that his plan had succeeded before taking action himself. He is not ashamed to run away from battle since from all of his experience that he had witnessed, he thinks that the only people who are able to survive in the Mafia world are people who chose to save their own lives rather than those who chose to die that he considers a meaningless death. Despite his intelligence, during the Inheritance Ceremony Arc, he appeared to become increasingly unstable as the battle goes on, becoming so overconfident that he was less cautious in battle.
  </p>
  <p key="9dc2a8f6-999c-4be8-85ba-229477346f65">
   It is also shown that he looked down on people of the past, seeing them as merely dead people who are buried in the ground, and felt somewhat insulted when Giotto and Cozzato mess with him by giving Tsuna their Flames that still live within Sky Vongola Ring and Earth Simon Ring, despite being already dead. Ironically though, contradicting his own words, the reason behind his actions was Elena, who is also dead.
  </p>
  <p key="ae95a4e9-c452-4f43-920b-cb7cdae2575f">
   Behind these apathetic and indifferent traits, however, he was actually tormented by guilt over what he perceived as his past failure; being unable to prevent Elena's death. He kept his affliction deep within him and devoted himself to fulfilling the promise he made to Elena so as not to cause further grief. These efforts, unfortunately, caused him to be blinded by his quest that he could not realize and he kept denying his true friendship with the Primo even though he secretly still treasured his bond with the Primo and the other Guardians, evidenced by his still keeping the pocket watch that Primo gave to him and the other first-generation Vongola Guardians.

  <p key="b69590d9-908a-4d7e-a42d-5deacb2fac48">
   Demon Spade is an extremely powerful illusionist, so much that he is powerful enough to deceive the Arcobaleno's five senses and the Vongola's Hyper Intuition. His illusions are even capable of imitating his opponents' fighting style and techniques. He is able to use his illusions to copy his opponents' abilities and weapons, seen when he copied Hibari, Chrome, Ryohei, Lambo, Yamamoto, and Gokudera's Vongola Gears. With the construction characterization of the Mist Flame, he can create real objects or Box Weapons. The power of the illusion is comparable in both appearance and power to the actual object. It is also shown that he can disable the illusions of other people, as shown when he is able to remove Chrome's illusionary organs that Mukuro gave her and replace them with his own illusionary organs. Due to him being in possession of Julie's body, he's able to utilize both Mist Flame and Desert Flame, making him even more powerful, as both Flames specialized in illusions. He is also skilled in direct combat, able to fight on equal ground against Mukuro. When he possesses Mukuro's body, he gains the
   Flame of Night
   , along with Six Flames of the Earth and exceeding either his previous power or Mukuro's. His power has increased to the point where Mukuro refers to him as not a human, but a monster.

Though, this is most likely because he doesn't have any body to begin with because he's supposed to be dead. Unlike Mukuro, he is able to possess a body for extended periods of time and is able to feel pain. However, this possession also prevents him from using his full power, depending on the vessel he is possessing.

   In Drama CD: Proof of Friendship, Demon appeared along with the other first generation Family, in the middle of paper work. When Giotto declined that idea of taking lunch together and went out rather hastily, Demon noticed that Giotto's behaviour is unusual, leading the other Guardians for exception of Alaudi, worried. When Lampow guessed that Giotto might have a lover, Demon supported this guess and added that Giotto might be attacked if he's left alone, making the other Guardians worried. Overcome by their worries, G, Lampow, Ugetsu, and Knuckle decided to follow Giotto, but Demon and Alaudi didn't join them because they still have some works to do. Demon and Alaudi then arrived at Talbot's craft shop after they found the invitation letters that Giotto had placed in their quarters and they went to the restaurant where Giotto had arranged a special dinner for them. At the restaurant, he received a golden pocket watch as proof of their friendship from Giotto and toasted for their Family and eternal friendship.

   In Secret Bullet Volume 5, he made a brief appearance in the last chapter of the volume, near the end of the chapter that took place several days before the Inheritance Ceremony. While disguising as Julie, Demon served the Simon Family foods that symbolize the Vongola in order to test whether Enma and the others have a change of heart in going through with their plan to fight the Vongola after seeing them getting closer with Tsuna and the others. He was relieved to see that they're still determined to destroy Vongola, musing that things goes according to his plan.
