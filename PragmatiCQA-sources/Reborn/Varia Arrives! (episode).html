   Two figures are seen exchanging blows through the streets and rooftops of

   his flame appears to be
   blue
   . The combatants continue to fight fiercely before the
   swordsman
   angrily questions why the young man with the flame has come to Japan. The flame user refuses to answer, prompting the swordsman to retaliate harder, flinging the younger man over the side of the building. As he hangs from the buildings ledge, a photo slips from the young mans jacket as he earnestly refuses to give in; the photo is eventually shown to feature Tsuna and his
   mother
   .

  <p key="f198164c-65aa-4dd3-a6be-76c88440de1c">
   The next morning, Tsuna comes down stairs and is greeted by the usual chaos of his household. Most notably, his mother is in a particularly good mood and is cooking vast amounts of food, and no one can seem to figure out why. Nana gleefully informs him that his
   father
   is finally coming home after two years abroad, much to Tsuna's shock. For the past two years, Tsuna had been labouring under the assumption that his Dad had mysteriously disappeared, since that was the story Iemitsu had asked Nana to tell him since it sounded more "romantic". Truthfully, he's been abroad as a worker on an oil rig.

   Yamamoto
   and
   Gokudera
   are amused by the news, saying it's exciting that his father was finally returning home after so long. Tsuna isn't so sure, saying that the more he thinks about it the weirder he thinks the whole situation is, and says that his Dad has a history of saying and doing crazy stuff. To take Tsuna's mind off it, his friends propose skipping school and hanging out for the day instead.

   Futa
   , the group decides to go to the arcade at Futa's suggestion. However, Kyoko points out that Lambo has gone missing, though he's quickly found asleep amongst the animals in a nearby pet shop. After being rescued from the store, with profuse apologies to the owner, Lambo immediately runs off and gets himself in trouble again; this time parading around a lingerie shop with a bra on his head. The group eventually manages to make it to the arcade, followed by spending some time in a music store, and taking photos in a purikura booth.
  </p>
  <p key="fcea4cfc-518a-4743-9b37-88717e592078">
   While taking a small break between activities, Kyoko confesses she's glad Tsuna is still the same as ever after coming back from his encounter in
   Kokuyo
   , as she was worried he'd have changed. Their conversation is short lived however, as explosions rock a nearby building and the young man with the mysterious blue flame suddenly falls from the sky, landing directly on Tsuna. The boy immediately recognizes Tsuna, and Reborn in turn recognizes him and wonders what he's doing in Namimori. They're quickly interrupted again by the silver-haired swordsman that was attacking the flame user the previous night, who immediately unleashes a flurry of attacks on the group. The young man apologizes for placing Tsuna in danger, though Tsuna is more confused as to how this stranger knows his name, before taking his hand to try and flee from their attacker.
  </p>
  <p key="a55219f7-0e55-4b09-b8a0-d3375db8afe4">
   The swordsman blocks their way however, and once again launches a vicious attack at the blue flame user and begins to question Tsuna, who unlike the young man does not appear to have any idea who he is. The interrogation is interrupted by Gokudera's bombs, though the swordsman easily dodges the attacks. Yamamoto and Gokudera face down the attacker, with Yamamoto volunteering to fight him first as a fellow swordsman. The mysterious young man pulls himself from the rubble and warns Yamamoto against it, saying the silver-haired mans strength would far outclass Tsuna and his friends current abilities. Disregarding the warning, Yamamoto and the swordsman begin to clash. The intruder scoffs at Yamamoto's power and easily defeats him by ejecting small pellets of gunpowder from along his
   blades
   edge. He immediately switches targets and overpowers Gokudera in an instant, deriding the pair for challenging him. The blue flame user quickly steps in and prevents the swordsman from inflicting further harm, blocking him with his own
   boomerang-like weapon
   , and the two begin to furiously exchange blows again.
  </p>
  <p key="709deb6b-4a7c-4f85-bc28-8aedbd2eb13c">
   Tsuna laments the situation and wonders what he should do, at which point his
   gloves
   are thrown at his face by Reborn, who scolds him saying that no matter the time or place he should always have those gloves. While Tsuna yells at Reborn for disappearing during the battle, the blue flame user is defeated by the older swordsman and his Dying Will Flame is extinguished; prompting further derision from the silver-haired man and causing him to direct his attention to Tsuna. Tsuna panics, but is quickly
   shot
   by Reborn and enters
   Dying Will Mode
   . Tsuna's flame and the emblem on his gloves are swiftly noted by the swordsman, who correctly deduces his identity and plans to question him further. Tsuna attempts to attack, but is quickly overpowered just like his friends.
  </p>
  <p key="3715f796-3ca1-4a0b-b2a3-bc243d909782">
   His Dying Will Flame evaporates soon after, prompting Tsuna to flee from the mysterious attacker, causing the swordsman to launch more of his gunpowder projectiles. The attack is intercepted by the blue flame users weapon, which he threw like a boomerang while simultaneously shielding Tsuna and himself using nearby rubble. The young man finally introduces himself as Basil, he then says he has a gift for Tsuna from his master before presenting him with a box of
   rings
   that appear to be missing half of their band and emblem. Tsuna is bewildered by the rings, but Basil says Reborn should understand what they are before urging Tsuna and Reborn to flee once more. The pair are interrupted again by the swordsman obliterating their rubble shield, the silver-haired man is immediately interested in the rings and declares he'll finish Tsuna and Basil off before departing with the box of rings.
  </p>
  <p key="8bd1002e-0bb4-42f9-a1c8-92b225156606">
   Tsuna cowers with the box of rings, thinking back on how quickly his friends were defeated and how he couldn't manage to fight even after entering Dying Will Mode. Before either Tsuna or the swordsman can make another move however they're interrupted by a familiar face, Tsuna's "big brother"
   Dino
   , who somehow seems to know the mystery swordsman too, revealing his name to be Superbia Squalo. Squalo looks visibly taken aback by Dino's presence, as Dino chastises him for attacking a bunch of kids.
